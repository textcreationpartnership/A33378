            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THE deſign of the Book which I here offer you, being chiefly to invalidate thoſe pretended proofs of <hi>Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity,</hi> wherewith men would ſet up ſuch new Opinions as alter the purity of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> touching the Holy <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,</hi> I have therefore reaſon to believe that this preſent Treatiſe will not prove unacceptable to you; for altho the Religion we profeſs, needs not the hands of men to ſupport it, no more than heretofore the Ark of the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> yet have we cauſe to praiſe God, when we ſee that Reproach, of departing from the Ancient Faith, may be juſtly retorted upon them, who charge us with it. Ye will find here in this Diſcourſe a faithful and plain repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of things, ſuch as they are in truth, in oppoſition to every thing which the Wit of Man, and the fruitfulneſs of Human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention have been able to bring forth to dazle mens Eyes and corrupt their Judgments: As ſoon as ever I had read the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of theſe Gentlemen whom I anſwer, the firſt thought that came into my mind was that of <hi>Solomon, That God made man</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>upright, but he had ſought out many inventions.</hi> And indeed, what is plainer than the Supper of our Lord, as he himſelf has inſtituted it, and his Apoſtles have delivered it to us; and what can be more prepoſterous than to ſearch for what we ought to believe touching this Sacrament, amongſt the various Opinions of theſe later Ages and different Inclinations of men; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially amongſt them, who are at fartheſt diſtance from us: Theſe remote ways do of themſelves fill us with doubts and ſuſpicions, and the bare propoſal of them muſt needs diſguſt us, and make us draw conſequences, little advantageous to the Doctrins which theſe Gentlemen would Authorize. Yet I have not refuſed to joyn iſſue with them on their own Principles, as far as the truth will permit me; and if they would read this Anſwer with a free unprejudiced mind, I am certain that they themſelves will acknowledg the contrary to what they have endeavoured to perſuade others.</p>
               <p>I here offer you then Gentlemen, and my moſt Honored Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, this laſt fruit of my Labor: firſt, for your own Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſecondly, for a publick teſtimony of my Reſpect and
<pb facs="tcp:41961:5"/> acknowledgments. All that I do, or have done, is juſtly due to you, not only upon the account of the Right which ye have over me and my Labors, but likewiſe becauſe it is partly from your good Examples that I have taken, and do ſtill every day draw the motives which ſtrengthen me in the ways of God and in the love of his Truth. It is in your Holy Society that I learn the Art of ſerving the common Maſter of both Angels and Men, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the purity of that Worſhip, which he hath preſcribed us, and at the ſame time, how to work out my own Salvation as well as that of others. And indeed what is it, that a man cannot learn in an Aſſembly, wherein all hearts and minds do unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly concur in the practice of Piety and Charity, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of perſons who have no other aim, but ſo to order their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, as to draw down thereby the Bleſſings of Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves and the people whom God hath committed to their Charge, and render themſelves worthy of the protection of our great and Invincible Monarch. This Work would have been publiſhed ſooner, had it not been for three great Loſſes we have ſuffered by the Death of Mr. <hi>Drelincourt,</hi> Mr. <hi>Daillé,</hi> and <hi>Morus;</hi> three names worthy to be had in everlaſting Remembrance. Theſe perſons have left us ſo ſuddenly one after another, that we have ſcarcely had time to bewail each of 'em as much as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired: The loſs of the firſt of theſe extremely afflicted us; the loſs of the ſecond overwhelmed us with Sorrow; and the Death of the laſt ſtupified us with Heavineſs. God having taken to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf theſe three famous Divines, it was impoſſible but this work ſhould be retarded. But being now at length able to Publiſh it, I therefore entreat you Gentlemen, to ſuffer me to Dedicate it to you, that it may appear in the World honored with your Names. May the Father of Lights, from whom deſcendeth every good and perfect Gift, enrich you more with his Graces, and preſerve your Holy Aſſembly, and the Flock committed to your care: Theſe are the ardent Prayers of your moſt Humble and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Servant and Brother in Chriſt Jeſus,</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Diſpute which the firſt Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> of the Faith hath occaſion'd on this Subject of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> has made ſuch a noiſe in the world, ſince Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s laſt Book, that I have no need to give an account of the motives which engage me in this third Reply. Beſides, it is evident to every one, that the Cauſe which I defend, and which I cannot forſake without betraying my Truſt and Conſcience, obliges me neceſſarily to ſtate clearly matters of Fact, and maintain or refute thoſe Doctrins which are debated between Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> and me.</p>
            <p>AND yet whatſoever juſtice and neceſſity there may be for publiſhing this Work, I am afraid ſome perſons will be diſpleaſed, ſeeing ſo much written on the ſame Subject; for this is the ſixth Book ſince the firſt Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> has been publiſh'd, beſides two others of <hi>Father Nouet</hi>'s and mine. And theſe Tracts which at firſt were but ſmall, have ſince inſenſibly grown into great Volumes. Yet for all this, we have not ſeen what Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> or his Friends are oblig'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce as to the firſt ſix Centuries, of which without doubt much may be ſaid on both ſides.</p>
            <p>IF any complain of this prolixity, I confeſs it will not be altogether without cauſe. For altho the Controverſie of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is one of the moſt important, that is between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> and which deſerves therefore to be carefully examin'd, yet ſince it may be treated, with greater brevity, even this conſideration of its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, is a good reaſon for ſhunning all tedious Digreſſions, which tire the Readers mind, and divert it from attending to ſo neceſſary a truth. But it would be very unreaſonable to charge me with this irkſome length of our Debates, ſince none can be juſtly blamed, but thoſe who have firſt made this Labyrinth, and then plunged themſelves into it, to the end they might forcibly draw others after them. For as to my own part, I have ever proteſted, that I entred not into it, but in condeſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only to follow them; and that I might endeavour to draw them out of it, and bring 'em into the right way.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:41961:6"/>
            <p>IT is certain that for ending of this Controverſie, we muſt have recourſe only to the Holy Scriptures, by which we may examin the nature of the Sacrament, which our Saviour inſtituted, and the end which he hath appointed it for, the force of the Expreſſions which he hath made uſe of, the manner after which he himſelf did Celebrate it, the circumſtances which accompanied this Celebration, the Impreſſion which his Words and his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be thought to make on the minds of his Apoſtles, who were eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes of what they have delivered to us, and the agreement which this Sacrament ought to have with the other parts of the Chriſtian Religion; and in a word every thing which is wont to be conſider'd, when men make an exact ſearch after truth. This way without doubt would be the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and certaineſt, or to ſpeak better, the only certain method for ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and that which can only quiet the Conſcience: For the Sacraments of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> being as they are, of an immediate Divine Inſtitution, our Faith, our Hope, and our obſervance of them, ought to be grounded immediately on the Word of God, there being no Creature who is able to extend them beyond the bounds of the Heavenly Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>IT were indeed to be deſired, that the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> had taken this courſe; but ſeeing they have been pleaſed to take another, and enquire after the Faith of the Ancient Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the riſe of theſe Controverſies, they ought at leaſt to have ſpared their Readers the trouble of all fruitleſs and unprofitable Digreſſions: for ſo I call whatſoever they have done hitherto; eſpecially in Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi>'s laſt Volume. He hath engaged himſelf to give us another, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he promiſeth to enquire into the belief of the ſix firſt Ages, which plainly ſhews, that he himſelf confeſſes the neceſſity of ſuch a Diſquiſition. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then hath he not at firſt taken this courſe, ſeeing that at length he muſt come to it? What neceſſity is there of taking up imaginary ſuppoſitions concerning the diſtinct belief of the <hi>Preſence,</hi> or rather <hi>Real Abſence;</hi> and of the conformity of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and other <hi>Eaſtern Chriſtians</hi> with the Roman Church, in the Doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation?</p>
            <p>WE have ſeen within a ſhort time three different methods of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this Subject, that of Father <hi>Maimbourg</hi>'s, that of Father <hi>Nouet</hi>'s, and that of Mr. <hi>Arnaud.</hi> The firſt ſeems to put a ſtop to all farther enquiry, by this reaſon, that what hath been once eſtabliſhed, ought not to be called in queſtion; and on this Principle he juſtifies the Doctrin of the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> and <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> which having been decided by Councils, ought not again to be brought under examination. The ſecond conſents to a Review, and to this end allows us to ſearch for the true
<pb facs="tcp:41961:6"/> Doctrin of the Church in the Scriptures, and amongſt the <hi>Fathers</hi> from Age to Age. The laſt permits what hath been already decided to be called in queſtion, but withal, propoſeth for finding out the true Doctrin of the Church, that men ought alſo to hearken to ſuch arguments as are grounded on certain maxims which it ſuppoſeth.</p>
            <p>OF theſe three methods, that of Father <hi>Nouets</hi> is certainly the moſt reaſonable and eaſie; and had he contented himſelf with the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, without entangling himſelf in the Writings of the Fathers; which be himſelf hath compared to a Wood, where ſuch as are purſued do ſave themſelves: on this account his method had been commendable. That of Father <hi>Maimbourg</hi> is unjuſt, becauſe he ſets up the deciſions of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils againſt us, not remembring that nothing can be preſcribed againſt Truth; especially when Salvation is concerned; and that the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Councils are not conſiderable any farther with us, than they are agreeable with the holy Scripture, and the Principles of Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; there cannot therefore be any more reaſonable or effectual way to end theſe particular Differences which divide us, than to examin ſtrictly and impartially whether this agreeableneſs which we plead for, be neceſſary or no. Yet it muſt be granted, that this method of Father <hi>Maimbourg</hi>'s is far more direct, and better contriv'd than that of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s. For beſides, that it is more agreeable to the Doctrin and intereſt of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church,</hi> taking for its Principles the Authority of the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal deciſions, which the other doth not, it engageth not a man as the other doth into new Diſputes and new dangers: yet both of them avoid a thro ſearch into the bottom of the Controverſie. Now that which oppoſeth the judgment of the Councils can only involve us in that Debate which concerns the Authority of the Repreſentative Church and its Aſſemblies; whereas the other makes ſuppoſitions which we affirm to be falſe, and of which we pretend, there cannot any good uſe be made, even tho we were not able to ſhew the falſity of them; and by this means it entangles us into new and long Controverſies, whereby they gain nothing, but rather run a greater riſque of loſing the whole Cauſe which they defend, ſo that it ſeems this new way was invented for no other end but to give us new advantages againſt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and its Doctrins.</p>
            <p>AND this will evidently appear, if we take but the pains to read this work. For firſt we ſhall ſee in general the uſeleſneſs of the ſuppoſitions and reaſonings of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> and of Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> and in particular the unprofitableneſs of their ſuppoſitions touching the <hi>Greeks</hi> and other Churches, which are called <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi> This is the Subject of the firſt and ſecond Book. In the firſt I ſhow that the method of theſe Gentlemen can be of no effect in reſpect of us, and that
<pb facs="tcp:41961:7"/> we are not in reaſon oblig'd to hear, or anſwer them, whilſt they lay aſide the holy Scripture, which is the only Rule of our Faith; and yet leave unanſwer'd the proofs of fact, taken from the teſtimony of the <hi>Fathers;</hi> by which we are perſuaded that there hath been made a change in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church.</hi> In the ſecond I make it appear that tho it were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the <hi>Greeks</hi> and other <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> do agree with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in the Doctrins of the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> and <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,</hi> yet the conſequences which theſe Gentlemen would draw thence will be of no force, for it will not hence follow that theſe Doctrins have been always received by the Chriſtian Church, which is the chief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Book.</p>
            <p>IN the ſecond place I diſcover the falſity of this ſuppoſition, that the true <hi>Greek</hi> Church, and other Eaſtern <hi>Chriſtians</hi> do believe Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, and Adore the Sacrament after the ſame manner as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does. The contrary of this will appear ſo plainly, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Proofs ſo ſolidly anſwered, that a man would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſee with what confidence he treats of this matter, in which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays ſo great ignorance and overſight. Here alſo his pretended proofs touching the <hi>Greeks,</hi> from the <hi>7th.</hi> to the <hi>11th.</hi> and touching the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi> in the <hi>7th.</hi> and <hi>8th.</hi> Centuries are fully confuted, together with the conſequences which he hath blindly drawn from thence of the conſent of all <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches in the Doctrins of the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> and <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation.</hi> This is the Subject of the <hi>3d. 4th.</hi> and <hi>5th.</hi> Book. The third proves by many and clear arguments, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not believe Tranſubſtantiation, nor adore the <hi>Sacrament</hi> with the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Latria,</hi> as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth, and moreover ſhews par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly what their Doctrins are, wherein they agree with the <hi>Latins</hi> and with us, and wherein they differ. In the fourth I anſwer all Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi>'s Proofs, diſcovering their weakneſs, and make it appear, that the greateſt part of what he offers does neceſſarily conclude againſt him. And becauſe of the affinity of the matter, I examin at the ſame time his <hi>7th.</hi> Book, wherein he treats of Greek Authors, of the <hi>7th. 8th. 9th.</hi> and <hi>10th.</hi> Centuries. In my fifth Book I paſs over to the other <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> which are called <hi>Schiſmaticks, Moſcovites, Armenians, Neſtorians, Jacobites, Coptics, Ethiopians,</hi> and ſhow they do not believe Tranſubſtantiation nor the Real Preſence, with the <hi>Latins.</hi> From thence I come to the <hi>Latins</hi> in the <hi>7th.</hi> and <hi>8th.</hi> Centuries, and examine Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s <hi>8th.</hi> Book, after which I conſider his <hi>10th.</hi> Book, which concerns the conſequences drawn from the conſent of the Churches, which he pretends to have proved; and I make it appear that they are but <hi>Paralogiſms</hi> and <hi>Sophiſms.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:41961:7"/>
            <p>IN the third place I lay open the falſity of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s ſecond ſuppoſition, touching the diſtinct belief of the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute his ſixth Book. Afterwards in refuting the ninth Book, I ſhow the abſurdity of his conjectures about the impoſſibility of a change, and demonſtrate that 'tis not only poſſible, but might eaſily happen. Laſtly, the innovation of <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> is as evidently prov'd as a thing of that nature can be. This is the ſubject of my ſixth Book.</p>
            <p>NOW from all theſe diſcourſes it will evidently appear what I have already obſerv'd, <hi>That this new way hath not been laid open,</hi> but for to give us new advantages againſt the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I speak not of the intention of theſe Gentlemen, for they have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelves plainly enough againſt us, to leave no place for us to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect them of any colluſion. And the laſt Book of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> hath provided againſt all ſuch ſuſpicions ſomething more perhaps than is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. But I ſpeak of the ſucceſs their method hath had, which hath been quite contrary to their intention. As for example, it hath given me occaſion to prove, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> did not believe <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> nor the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> taught, when they condemned <hi>Berengarius,</hi> neither in the preceding nor follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages: That whatſoever <hi>efforts</hi> the <hi>Latins</hi> have made ſince the <hi>11th.</hi> Age to this preſent, to procure the reception of theſe Doctrins in <hi>Greece,</hi> yet the true Greek Church hath not embraced them: Neither do the <hi>Armenians</hi> and other <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> believe them any more than the Greeks.</p>
            <p>NOW who ſeeth not that the firſt and moſt natural conſequences which can be drawn from thence is, That theſe Doctrins are new; for if they were eſtabliſh'd at firſt together with the Chriſtian Religion, they would have appeared in thoſe Churches, and been retain'd among them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their ſeparation from the <hi>Latins,</hi> and that they do not appear, is a manifeſt ſign of their novelty. This conſequence is not like that of Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> his and mine are not only contrary in the matter, but they are likewiſe very different in form; for mine is juſt and direct, whereas his is neither juſt nor true. For ſuppoſe the <hi>Greeks</hi> and other <hi>Eaſtern Chriſtians</hi> ſhould at this day believe <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> nay ſuppoſe they ſhould have believed it, ſome Ages ſince, what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage can Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> make of this, ſeeing he hath been ſhewed ſeveral ways by which it might be introduced into their Churches? But if it be true that they held it not neither in the <hi>11th,</hi> nor in the following Age, as I have invincibly prov'd, then it cannot be imagin'd how it ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear,
<pb facs="tcp:41961:8"/> nor how the <hi>Latins</hi> who have for ſeveral Ages ſince, overſpread theſe Countreys with their <hi>Emiſſaries,</hi> would have ſuffered ſuch a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin to be loſt amongſt them, which it was ſo much their intereſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. Moreover, this ſame method hath furniſh'd me with an occaſion to overthrow the pretended <hi>impoſſibilities</hi> of a <hi>change;</hi> and to make appear on the contrary the facility thereof. Now ſuppoſe we could not anſwer the Arguments of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud,</hi> this would be but little advantage to their cauſe: for ſtill our proofs of the matter of <hi>fact,</hi> would remain unanſwer'd, without the examination of which, the queſtion of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> of the Doctrins in Controverſie cannot be decided. Whereas theſe having made it appear that their pretended impoſſibilities are mere Chimera's, and that this change might eaſily happen, this is a great inducement to believe our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it is really true.</p>
            <p>IT is then certain that theſe Gentlemen could not make a worſe choice for the intereſt of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> than of ſuch a way, in which nothing of advantage to their Church can be expected, but ſhe is thereby expoſed to great fears and dangers; and that the cauſe which they have oppoſed is more beholding to them, than that which they have taken upon them to defend. Had it not been for them, perhaps we ſhould not have much troubled our ſelves either with diſcovering the real belief of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, or that of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> or with the diſplaying the myſtery of their <hi>Seminaries</hi> and <hi>Miſſions,</hi> neither ſhould we have concern'd our ſelves in ſhewing how the change could be wrought, and how it was made.</p>
            <p>AND having now given an account of the ſeveral parts of this work, and of the preſent ſtate of this Controverſie as to the matter of it, it is likewiſe fit to ſay ſomething of the manner in which I have handled it. One of my greateſt cares hath been religiouſly to keep to truth and ſincerity. For I am very ſenſible, that prejudice, partiality, love of vain glory, and even ſometimes a ſecret deſire of revenging a man's ſelf on his Adverſary, are paſſions which do commonly obtrude themſelves on us in Diſputes, and which never fail to corrupt the mind; I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore endeavoured to the utmoſt, not only to keep theſe from me, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to watch againſt their ſuſprizes. And for this purpoſe I can affirm I have laboured as in the ſight of God, not propoſing to my ſelf any other aim than his glory and truth; always remembring that I write not a line of which I muſt not one day give him an account. I have not warp'd from that ſincerity and uprightneſs which an honeſt man ought to obſerve on theſe occaſions. I have not taken Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s words in a wrong ſenſe, nor charged him with ſaying what indeed he ſaith not, nor
<pb facs="tcp:41961:8"/> ſtrained his expreſſions beyond their natural ſignification. No man can reproach me for making falſe citations, or maiming any paſſages, by ſuppreſſing that which is important; neither have I alledged them abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively and contrary to the intention of their Authors. I hope there is no unfair dealings, either in my Arguments, or Anſwers, in my Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or my other Diſcourſes. I have followed Reaſon and Nature as much as I could, and have not made uſe of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> but to ſtrengthen the ordinary notions of common ſenſe, and not to ſtifle or hinder their effects.</p>
            <p>I hope likewiſe that I ſhall not be complain'd of as having not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, either in general towards the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or in particular, towards Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> all that moderation which might be reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from me. I have noted the Errors and Sophiſms of Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud,</hi> which I have found very numerous, in every Subject on which he hath treated, eſpecially concerning the <hi>Greek</hi> Church. I was not a little troubled to ſee with what ſincerity he alledged ſeveral paſſages, whereof ſome are not faithfully tranſlated; and others ſo imperfectly, that he hath ſuppreſſed whole Clauſes, which would clear up the difficulty, and others which are palpably perverted, contrary to the ſenſe of their Authors. I could not but reſent his unhandſome dealing, when he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted from the <hi>ſeries</hi> of a diſcourſe, ſeveral of my words, to make them look of a quite contrary ſenſe than what was intended; or faſtned on them ſtrange chimerical ſenſes, that he might have ſome matter of triumph, or groundleſly ſlandered ſome famous men, or endeavoured to decry by violent and odious terms our morals, which cannot but be holy and pure, ſeeing we have no others, but what are taken from the Law and the Gospel. In fine, when he employs his declamatory ſtile, to dazle the eyes of the world, and to miſ-repreſent the truth. I have diſcovered ſeveral of his contradictions, and how much his opinions are influenc'd by his intereſt; ſeveral fallacious ſuppoſitions which he would have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd into this Diſpute, and ſome vain and ill-grounded accuſations with which he hath charged me; are clearly laid open; and ſome faults of his in Hiſtory and Grammar I have but lightly touched upon. In ſhort, I have ſet before him what I believe he ought to have ſaid on theſe occaſions, and others of the like kind; and do moreover here proteſt that I ſhould have wholly ſpared him in the moſt part of theſe matters, had the intereſt of the cauſe which I take upon me to defend permitted me ſo to do. But what I have ſaid to him has been without ſharpneſs and paſſion, and even with as little complaining as may be againſt his ſtarch'd Prefaces, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious tartneſs, which appears throughout his whole Book, wherein I every where meet with the rough terms of <hi>Enthuſiaſm, Extravagancy, ſenſleſs Propoſitions,</hi> and other ſuch like expreſſions. I confeſs that
<pb facs="tcp:41961:9"/> theſe injurious terms were not at all pleaſing to me, and preſently I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſhould uſe a ſtile ſo little becoming his profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but at length being accuſtom'd to it, I paſs'd over it, and have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted my ſelf by the motives of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> patience. There are very deſerving perſons, even of his own Communion, whom he has handled no better than my ſelf; and after all, it ſuffices me to know that I have not given juſt cauſe for ſo great animoſity and bitterneſs, as I do believe ſome have already acknowledg'd, and which I believe Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will acknowledg, when he has read my laſt Chapter, in which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his <hi>11th.</hi> Book, which concerns our pretended perſonal differences.</p>
            <p>AS to exactneſs, I believe I have kept as much to it as can be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, in ſuch an Anſwer as this. Indeed I have not followed blindfold Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> when he ſtrayed from his own ſubject, as he has done in the laſt Chapters of his firſt Book; where he treats of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> of <hi>Praying for the Dead,</hi> th' <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of <hi>Relicks,</hi> and the <hi>Prohibition</hi> of <hi>certain Meats.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR ſeeing the matter in hand only concerns the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> it would have been contrary to ſenſe, and a groſs abuſe to the Readers patience, to engage in theſe Controverſies, on each of which there might be written whole Volumes: not to ſay farther that I have endeavoured to avoid that prolixity which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſeems on the contrary to have affected. But according to prudence and diſcretion, I have omitted nothing conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Book, which relates to our preſent Controverſie unanſwer'd, except the two Diſſertations of the Criticiſm on <hi>John Scot,</hi> and on <hi>Bertram,</hi> to which there is a diſtinct Anſwer preparing. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> and his friends have done the like by me, for to ſpeak ingeniouſly and freely, is there any thing leſs exact or more careleſs than their large work, conſidering it as a Refutation of my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> of which they have ſcarcely handled the tenth part? They have taken here and there ſome one of my paſſages ſeparated from the ſequel of my diſcourſe, and the greateſt part of them turn'd into another ſenſe, hereupon they have travelled from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt.</hi> And this they call the <hi>Perpetuity of the Faith defended, againſt the Book of the Sieur</hi> Claude, <hi>Miniſter of</hi> Charenton. But ſeeing I have followed the ſecond Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> and even accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated my ſelf to its method, ought not then the Author in defending it againſt my Book <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o follow me a little more cloſely? And when he was oblig'd to write a ſecond Volume, as to what respects the firſt ſix Ages, certainly he ought to have conſidered the reſt with ſome care. Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi>'s <note place="margin">In his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</note> excuſe is vain and frivolous which he alledgeth for the length of this work. For to make it ſhort he needed only to have inſiſted on mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb facs="tcp:41961:9"/> eſſential, avoiding fruitleſs digreſſions and retrenching injurious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives. It is likewiſe a vain pretence of his, that in following my <hi>fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> as he is pleaſed to speak, the connexion of his Principles with their conſequences, remain hid and obſcured. For what elſe does he intend by this, but to preſerve theſe colours and appearances which cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſubſiſt? Wherefore ſhould he call that method which the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> hath himſelf begun, and which I have but follow'd; wherefore I ſay ſhould he term this my <hi>fancies?</hi> Wherefore ſhould he at leaſt ſuppreſs ſeveral things which I propoſed in order to the diſcovery of the falſity of theſe pretended Principles and their conſequences, and wherefore muſt this neglect have the Title of the <hi>Perpetuity defended?</hi> For my part, who de not believe my ſelf bound to follow this example, I have examin'd whatſoever I found of importance in Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> be it never ſo difficult. If I have changed his method in ſome places, it hath been to lay down a better, more ſhort and natural, as when I joyned his 7th. Book, which treateth of <hi>Greek</hi> Authors from the <hi>7th.</hi> Age to the <hi>11th.</hi> to the general Dispute touching the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, to avoid doing twice the ſame thing: or when I referred his ſixth Book touching the diſtinct belief of the Preſence, or Real Abſence, to the queſtion of the <hi>impoſſibility</hi> of a <hi>change,</hi> becauſe that in effect this diſtinct be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief was not invented but for this purpoſe, or when I remitted what he ſaid of <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> and the Authors of the <hi>9th.</hi> Age, in the ſecond part of his <hi>8th.</hi> Book, to the account of the Innovation, becauſe this was its proper place. But even in this I have not at all weakened Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s proofs, nor the leſs exactly examin'd his Book.</p>
            <p>AS to what further remains, the Authors which I have made uſe of cannot be ſuſpected by Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> ſeeing they are for the moſt part, either <hi>Greeks,</hi> or perſons of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, or Authors of former Ages, which neither one nor other of 'em have written with any foreſight of our debate. I have alledged but very few <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and they ſuch of whoſe ſincerity there is no reaſon to doubt. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> and his friends have not done the ſame, who have cited in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, Acts and Atteſtations, ſent by the <hi>Emiſſaries,</hi> ſuch as the Acts of a Synod of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> the Profeſſion of Faith of ſix Prieſts belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Patriarchate</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and ſuch like particulars in the <hi>12th.</hi> Book, of the Writings of the <hi>Greeks, Armenians,</hi> or <hi>Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> latinis'd, as of <hi>Manuel Calecas,</hi> of <hi>John Pluſiadene,</hi> of <hi>Adam Neſtorian,</hi> and of <hi>Hacciadour,</hi> an Armenian Patriarch now reſident at <hi>Rome,</hi> the teſtimonies of the Scholars of the Seminary of <hi>Rome,</hi> as of <hi>Payſius, Ligardius,</hi> of <hi>Abraham Ecchellenſis,</hi> and of <hi>Leo Allatius,</hi> &amp;c. They have likewiſe frequently made uſe of him that has lately continued <hi>Baronius,</hi> named <hi>Odoricus Raynaldus</hi> a
<pb facs="tcp:41961:10"/> Prieſt of the Oratory at <hi>Rome;</hi> but if any would know of what autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity this Author is, he may be inform'd by this deſcription: <hi>He is a man of little wit, of no judgment, no ſincerity, no credit, who takes matters upon truſt with an unſufferable boldneſs, and delivers the moſt unjuſtifiable pretenſions of the Court of</hi> Rome <hi>with the ſame confidence as if they were Articles of Faith, who citeth Authors known to be the moſt partial and paſſionate of all others, as</hi> Poggius, Blondius, Turrecremata, <hi>and ſuch like, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reprovable witneſſes, and by following whoſe Teſtimonies, we ſhall be obliged to condemn the beſt of men, even thoſe whom God hath own'd by Miracles, who for want of proofs, makes uſe of unjuſt clamours and outragious declamations, unbecoming an Hiſtorian, who ought never to be led by paſſion. And in ſhort, ſuch a man than whom there was never any leſs fit, for ſo important a work, as is an Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory.</hi> And this is the true Character of this Author. Who would imagin that perſons who believe what I now rehearſed, and who deſire the whole world to be of the ſame judgment with them, ſhould make uſe of him, in a diſpute ſo important as this, and take from him the greateſt part of their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And yet theſe are the Gentlemen who quote him at preſent with ſo great confidence, after they themſelves have repreſented him in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I mention'd. It was either Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> or ſome of his <note place="margin">Remarks on the 18th. Tome of the Eccleſiaſtical Annals of <hi>Rodoricus Raynaeldus. Aug. contr. Fauſt. lib. 32. ch.</hi> 16.</note> Friends, who under the name of <hi>ſeveral Divines</hi> have taken the pains to publiſh their Animadverſions on this Hiſtory after a diligent peruſal of it. Whereupon may we not juſtly apply to them that of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus, Who is there that having decried a witneſs as falſe and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, will ever again produce his teſtimony? If we believe him, and believe him not according to your fancy, it is not him whom we believe, but you.</hi> And if we muſt needs <hi>believe you, what need is there of your producing other witneſſes.</hi> We ſhall ſee what theſe Gentlemen will do henceforward, for ſhould they take the ſame courſe again as they have taken already in this occaſion, ſhould they pretend to quote no other Authors but what are decried, falſe <hi>Greeks,</hi> Scholars of the Seminaries, perſons won to the intereſts of <hi>Rome,</hi> or Proſelytes of its Doctrin, and remitted to its Sea, this would be as much as to ſay that their Authority would have a greater ſhare in this Controverſie than Reaſon, and perhaps they might be let alone to talk to themſelves, it being very unreaſonable that a man ſhould be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally employed in combating Phantaſms, and fighting with Shadows. For to maintain faithfully and ſolidly the Hypotheſis of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> This was moſt neceſſary to be prov'd, That the <hi>Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> and <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> were eſtabliſh'd and commonly held in all <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches, when <hi>Berengarius</hi> his Diſputations were on
<pb facs="tcp:41961:10"/> foot, for which end a thouſand atteſtations of perſons now living would be of no uſe. Theſe atteſtations may ſerve to ſhew that the care which hath been ſo long taken, and which is ſtill continued to introduce inſenſibly the Doctrins of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church into other Churches, by the ways which I have obſerved in my ſecond Book, and especially by their Miſſions and Seminaries hath not been altogether fruitleſs. But this is the greateſt abſurdity of all, to conclude from thence that the Doctrins in diſpute were every where eſtabliſhed in <hi>Berengarius</hi>'s time, or that they were perpetual. There is reaſon to hope that the world will not ſuffer it ſelf ſo eaſily to be cheated, and what hath here been done will ſufficiently manifeſt the Truth.</p>
            <p>WE live not now in the times of ignorance and darkneſs wherein mens credulity is eaſily abuſed. Our Age is an enlightned one, and its no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices are clear and penetrant, and we ſhould ſoon ſee the downfal of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ancient Errors, were they not ſupported by the affinity which they have with mens temporal intereſts. God will break off this alliance when it ſhall ſeem good in his ſight, but it is our duty to keep firm in his truth and prefer the honor we receive from it, above all the advantages of the earth, and beſeech him that he would reconcile thoſe to it by his Grace, who are far from it, that all of us may have but one heart to fear him, and one and the ſame mouth to glorifie him.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                        <argument>
                           <p>That I have reaſon to take for granted, as I have done, the Proofs of Mr. <hi>Aubertin,</hi> againſt the Book of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> till Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> hath ſhewed them to be Invalid.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>ALthough the Paſſion, which appeareth throughout Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi>'s whole Book, doth in a manner perſwade me that his Cenſures are not always reaſonable, yet ſhall not this hinder me from examining them with a compoſed Mind: If they are found juſt, I ought to make my Advantage of them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out minding the ſharpneſs which accompanies them; and if they are not, the Intereſt of my Cauſe requires I ſhould endeavour to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the Injuſtice of them by a modeſt and Chriſtian Defence.</p>
                        <p>AND this Method I intend to uſe, not only in the beginning but likewiſe in all the following parts of this Work, which I dedicate to the diſcovery of Truth, and the advancement of Gods Glory, who is the Author and Father of Lights, and of Truth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>IT is certain,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> in the beginning of his Book, <hi>that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Mr. Claude</hi> may be granted the Priviledge, which he immediately lays <q>hold on, of inventing, and ſuppoſing, what he liſts, he takes a very ſure way to conclude from thence what he pleaſes. I only admire that while he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41961:17"/> fancies he has this peculiar Liberty, he yet ſtill buſies himſelf in writing Books: For he can abſolutely determine all our Differences with a great deal leſs trouble. For he has no more to do but only immediately to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the Reaſon is on his ſide, and that the Catholicks are in the wrong, and ſo the whole Controverſie will be at an end, and thus may he ſatisfie himſelf with writing half a Page inſtead of an entire Anſwer, for it decid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the whole; 'Tis but ſuppoſing that Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book hath gotten the Victory over the Romiſh Schools, and that he has manifeſted to all the World, the Change the Roman Church hath made; That the Proofs are clear, ſtrong, and numerous, which make the Change ſenſibly apparent, and that he hath not been oppoſed with any other than falſe and imaginary Reaſonings: What need is there then of any other reply, and to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe does Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> take upon him all this Trouble? <hi>Calviniſm hath now won the Day, and Catholick Religion is utterly Routed.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE right of oppoſing to the reaſonings of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> the Proofs of the matters of Fact contained in Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book, and to ſpeak our Thoughts concerning it, is not ſo marvelous, nor ſuch an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary deſign that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſhould need raiſe ſuch a Conteſt about it. This Author having undertaken to make us confeſs, if we are not deſperately ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, <hi>that the Belief of the Roman Church,</hi> touching the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> is the ſame with that <hi>of all Antiquity,</hi> and having made uſe of no other reaſonings for this purpoſe, but thoſe which are taken from the moral Impoſſibility of this Change which we believe hath hap'ned; Common Senſe convinces us that he is bound to examine the Proofs of Matters of Fact on which the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, he would root out of our Minds, is eſtabliſhed, for till then all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guings will be to no purpoſe. Neither can we juſtly be denied the Liberty of mentioning theſe Proofs according to our real Thoughts. For ſeeing we offer them againſt the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> only as a prejudication which hinders us from heark'ning to his Arguments, it is therefore very requiſite we ſhould ſpeak our Thoughts about them, to the end that if this Author continues in the deſign of bringing us to an acknowledgment of what he pretends, he eſpecially take care to remove, as much as in him lies, thoſe things which render all his other Endeavours ineffectual.</p>
                        <p>I do not at all doubt if mens Minds were free from Prejudice, but it would be granted that Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book doth perfectly decide the Controverſie touching the Euchariſt. It being a complete Piece, in which this matter is ſearched to the bottom. He hath anſwered thoſe who have treated on this Subject before his time, and yet his Book has layn even to this preſent unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, which is a ſufficient Reaſon to preſume he hath gotten the better, and that his Proofs, let Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſay what he will, are plainly evident and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous; but for as much as it is needful for the ending of a Difference, and quieting Contradiction, to ſuppoſe Principles granted by both Parties, and ſeeing the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth neither agree in the Proofs nor in the Change, here in Queſtion, I do thereupon freely confeſs the Controverſie lyes ſtill open in this reſpect, and that in general we cannot ſtop any mans mouth by the ſimple ſuppoſition of the Strength and Solidity of that Book, for every Man is at liberty, and hath Right (if he pleaſes) to examine and anſwer it.</p>
                        <p>BUT had not Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſuppreſſed a great part of what I wrot on this Subject, as well in my firſt as ſecond Anſwer, it would immediately appear,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41961:17"/> I have bin ſo far from making ſuch a claim as that wherewith he chargeth me, that I have every where expreſly maintained the contrary.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>SEEING that Mr.</hi> Aubertin <hi>has made it appear, by expreſs Paſſages taken out of the Fathers</hi> (theſe are the Words in my firſt Anſwer.) <hi>That Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation was unknown to the antient Church, we may then well conclude there has hap'ned a Change, eſpecially conſidering that this ſame Tranſubſtantiation was not heard of till the 11th. Century; Now conſidering this, for a Man to Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phize on the impoſſibility thereof, is to give himſelf a great deal of Trouble to no purpoſe. If there yet remain'd any thing farther to be done, it would be to ſhew that the Paſſages produced by Mr.</hi> Aubertin <hi>are either falſe, or alleaged imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently againſt</hi> Tranſubſtantiation: <hi>but to paſs by theſe matters of Proof, which are clear, expreſs and concluſive, to adhere to I know not what kind of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended impoſſibility, this is to trifle with the matter in hand.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>OBSERVE here again what I ſaid in my ſecond Anſwer. <hi>We had reaſon to hope that the Author, treating my Abridgment in the reſpects and relations which the ſequel of its Reaſons oblige him to, ſhould have applyed himſelf unto one of theſe two things.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>EITHER to make it appear that Mr.</hi> Aubertin'<hi>s Proofs, on which we have relyed, are falſe, and of no force, or that the Conſequence, which is pretended to be drawn from them, is untrue; That is to ſay, it do's not follow a thing is poſſible, altho it be made apparent that this very thing has actually hap'ned.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>WHEN a man makes Suppoſitions of this kind, how abſurd is it to ſay, ſuch a one puts himſelf in Poſſeſſion of any <hi>Priviledge,</hi> or uſurps that <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous Right,</hi> of terminating Differences, or deciding Controverſies by groundleſs Suppoſitions? For I not only give this Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> the liberty of oppoſing Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Proofs, and to ſhew, if he can, the falſity of them, but I conjure him ſo to do, being engaged thereunto by the conſideration of his own Reputation, and the neceſſity of this Courſe to end the Controverſie. Now if this may be ſtiled by Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> the decid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Difference, I am certain that in the ſtyle of a more impartial Judge, this would be called, a diſengaging of the Debate out of an endleſs turning, to bring it back to a neceſſary Diſcuſſion on which dependeth the deciſion of our Controverſie. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> therefore unjuſtly chargeth me with intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to decide the Queſtion, and terminate the Difference by a ſimple Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and 'tis through want of Sincerity he has ſuppreſſed thoſe Paſſages in my Anſwer, which plainly evidence my real Deſign. But beſides theſe two Defaults which immediately offer themſelves to be obſerved in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, I muſt ingeniouſly declare that 'tis very hard for me to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend what he would have me to do. He ſeems to deſire me to prove that the Proofs of Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book are clear, ſtrong and numerous, before we ſuppoſe them to be ſuch. But pray what means proving of Proofs? How can a man otherwiſe prove them than in producing them, and engaging to defend them when they ſhall be attacked? Now this hath bin done, they have bin produced, in referring to a Book which is eaſily met with, there has bin an Abridgment made thereof, they have bin ſet forth with ſome Enlargments; The Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> hath bin requeſted to ſhew the inſufficiency or falſity of them. What can Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> deſire more? Would he have Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book reprinted at the Head of mine, together with a Commentary on the Solidity of his Proofs? But yet ſtill
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41961:18"/> perhaps he would not grant us the Liberty to ſpeak advantageouſly of it, we muſt have proved the Solidity of the firſt Commentary by a ſecond, and that of the ſecond by a third, and ſo heap up Commentary upon Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary till Dooms-Day. For he that would have us prove the Proofs of Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book may, by the ſame reaſon, require us likewiſe to prove the ſolidity of our Commentaries, and having ſet no bounds to his Demands, 'tis probable he would have extended them farther. Theſe are the firſt Fruits of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s <hi>frollickſom Philoſophy,</hi> the next time when he lights not into ſo pleaſant a Humor, we ſhall have others, but perhaps not ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting ones. But be it as it will, there is (I am ſure) a great deal of diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in this proceeding, for the ſtrength of a Proof is with good Reaſon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by that Perſon who offers it, till it hath received a ſatisfactory Anſwer, and ſo likewiſe the ſolidity of an Anſwer is taken for granted by him who makes it, till ſuch time as it ſhall be oppoſed by a good Reply. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſuch a man would appear Ridiculous, who would offer to put a ſtop to a Diſpute, and exempt himſelf from replying thereunto, by ſaying, <hi>prove to me the ſolidity of your Anſwer.</hi> If a Proof be not good, it belongs to him who anſwereth it, to ſhew its Defects, and if an Anſwer be impertinent, it lies upon the Opponent to diſcover the abſurdity thereof. For till then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man is at liberty to ſpeak his Thoughts.</p>
                        <p>ALTHO this is not a proper Place to treat on the different Uſe which may be made of Suppoſitions in a Controverſie, yet will I not forbear to ſpeak ſomewhat thereon to diſcover more plainly Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Miſtakes.</p>
                        <p>THE Suppoſitions then commonly made uſe of, are of two ſorts, ſome of them tend abſolutely to decide a Difference, others ſerve only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate it.</p>
                        <p>WHEN a man makes a Suppoſition to decide abſolutely a Difference, there ought to be ſuppoſed no other things but thoſe which are acknowledged and granted to be true by the Adverſaries themſelves, for theſe Suppoſitions are as common and inviolable Prejudications which ought to ſerve as a Law to direct the Judgment in the whole Controverſie.</p>
                        <p>BUT when we make Suppoſitions only to regulate the form of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, and hinder men from caſting themſelves into fruitleſs Conteſts, it ſufficeth the things ſuppoſed be eſteemed true by them who ſuppoſe them, others remaining ſtill in the liberty of judging and oppoſing them, if they think fit. So that after this manner each Party ſuppoſeth his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment true, and termeth it his <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> that is to ſay his Suppoſition; and if a man ſuppoſed it not true, he would not maintain it. We ſuppoſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe at the ſame time the Sentiment of the contrary Party falſe, for if we ſuppoſed it not falſe, we ſhould not reject it. And this is the true ſtate of a Controverſie. That every man be permitted to ſuppoſe he hath truth on his ſide, and act, or defend himſelf on this Suppoſition, yet allowing others the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſuppoſe the contrary; And this is not that which decideth a Debate, but that which forms it; For by this means there is given to the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie its juſt Bounds, and a man avoids wand'rings, in running after needleſs things; both parties have a juſt Equality allotted them, and ſo far as this, a Perſon cannot be required to ſhew his Proof for what he ſuppoſeth, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he fully and unfeignedly declares his Opinion.</p>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:41961:18"/>
                        <p>IN the following Parts of a Controverſie, there ought to be a diſtinction made between that Perſon who oppoſeth a thing, and he who anſwereth or defendeth it. The firſt of theſe deſigns ſo to order it that his Adverſary ſhall be obliged to change his Opinion, and therefore he ought not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any thing which he makes not good by Proofs; but he has likewiſe Right (as I ſaid juſt now) to ſuppoſe his Proofs good, till ſuch time as the contrary party has made ſome Anſwer. And it would be very abſurd to affirm ſuch a one deſigns to end the Difference by his Suppoſitions, or is obliged to prove his Proofs are good, ſeeing he grants every one the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to anſwer them, and in effect if there appears no Anſwer, the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is decided.</p>
                        <p>NOW as to him who anſwereth a matter, having upon this account no other aim but that of rendering ineffectual the Attempt of his Adverſary, he has always the Right to ſuppoſe his Opinion true without proving it, being only obliged to anſwer the Proofs which are brought againſt him, and diſcover either the falſity or inſufficiency of them. A man cannot perhaps fall into a greater irregularity, than to conſtrain him that Anſwereth, (and who has no more to do than to refure the Arguments alledged againſt him,) to make Arguments himſelf, and to pretend that he hath no right to propoſe his Anſwers taken from the Opinions themſelves which he defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, if he hath not before this proved his Opinion. Either he who oppoſeth muſt make apparent the falſity of the ſuppoſed Opinion, or elſe he muſt yield it to be true.</p>
                        <p>I know that in a publick Diſpute, mannaged by writing, it commonly happens, that the ſame Perſon oppoſeth another and defendeth himſelf, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds and anſwers, according as the occaſion and matter requireth, but we are notwithſtanding obliged to diſtinguiſh theſe two Qualities, of <hi>Aggreſſor</hi> and Reſpondent, and preſerve to each his Right apart; for it would be a very diſorderly matter to expect a man ſhould do that when he anſwereth, which he is not obliged to do but when he oppoſeth, or to expect he ſhould do that when he oppoſeth, which he is not obliged to do but in anſwering. It ſometimes happens that an Adverſary makes an Exchange, and whereas he is obliged to anſwer directly to the Proofs of the contrary Party, or to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe others againſt him of the like Nature and Force, he ſhifts them and falls into a Diſcourſe to no purpoſe, and all this while the contrary Proofs he ſhould have anſwered, remain firm. In ſuch an occaſion we have Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to reduce ſuch a one from his affected Wand'rings, by ſuppoſing the Proofs he has left unanſwered, ſtrong and ſollid. For in ſuch a caſe they are not ſuppoſed good and firm, but only to oblige him to anſwer them, and ſhew their weakneſs or falſity, and if he anſwereth them not, we may reckon as to him the Queſtion in effect is decided, becauſe when a man hath nothing to ſay againſt the Method of proceeding, and that the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Proofs have bin propoſed according to the exact Rules of Diſputation, a man muſt then either acquieſce in them or anſwer them, and to do neither of theſe is mere wrangling.</p>
                        <p>NOW to apply theſe Maxims to the matter in hand, and to judge of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Cenſure, we need but conſider firſt, That when I ſuppoſed Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Proofs to be firm and good, I did not thereby propoſe to my ſelf an abſolute end of the Queſtion touching the Change which hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by this ſimple Suppoſition; but only to regulate
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41961:19"/> the Debate, and reduce it within thoſe Bounds wherein it ought to be. Secondly, that in ſuppoſing them good, I have only delivered my Opinion which I take upon me to maintain againſt the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> without depriving him of the Liberty of defending the contrary. Thirdly, that I have ſuppoſed them to be good without proving them ſo, becauſe we ever ſuppoſe Proofs ſufficiently firm, till ſuch time as ſomething at leaſt is objected againſt them, and hitherto Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book has layn unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Fourthly, that I made uſe of them as a means whereby to reſiſt the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi>'s attempt, and when a man only defends himſelf in a Diſpute, he is not obliged to prove any thing. Fifthly and laſtly, I did not offer them but only as Prejudices at his Opinion, which ought neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to be removed out of our Minds, before the Arguments of the <hi>Perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> be offered us; for as much as theſe Prejudices make the Author's Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings ineffectual and improper to that deſign of making us acknowledg there hath bin introduced no Change into the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. From whence it follows, that I may not only ſuppoſe theſe Proofs are clear, firm, and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, ſeeing that 'tis under this Notion we have entertained theſe Prejudices; but morever ſuppoſe them without proving them, and I do ſo, to the end I may oblige the Author of that <hi>Treatiſe</hi> to ſhew us (if he can) that they do not amount to what we imagine.</p>
                        <p>IN ſhort if he would obtain his end, he muſt ſhew us that our Prejudice ought not to hinder us from hearkning to what he hath farther to offer us, (which is to ſay,) ſuppoſing our Proofs to be moſt firm and evident, yet ought they not to avert our Minds from conſidering his moral Conjectures;) or ſhew us that our Prejudices have no grounds, and that our Proofs are neither plain nor ſufficient. The firſt of theſe is abſurd, the ſecond is what we deſire him to take in hand. But inſtead of this Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has bethought himſelf, and requires us to prove the validity of our Proofs.</p>
                        <p>IF our Proofs, being ſuppoſed good, are in effect <hi>the Calviniſts Victory,</hi> and the <hi>Romaniſts Defeat,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> himſelf granteth, we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to admire he ſhould think he hath overthrown them, by five or ſix <hi>Lines</hi> ſtuffed <hi>with Raillery.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>HATH he bin more concerned at the calling of the Reaſonings of the <hi>Perpetuity, imaginary Conjectures,</hi> than at the <hi>glorious Victory</hi> over the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church which hath bin attributed to Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book, and this Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion brought in by the Church of <hi>Rome, which is apparent to all the World?</hi> Doth he more value the Reputation he thinks he hath gotten by writing a ſmall <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> than the ſettlement of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church? and ought he, for the intereſt of a particular work, to have rifled both <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt,</hi> whilſt in the mean time the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church periſheth <hi>before</hi> his eyes, lying pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>de Vence</hi> in his Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</note> at the Feet of <hi>Victorions Calviniſme.</hi> I will grant my Suppoſition reſides but in my own Imagination, and in theirs of the ſame Communion, yet certainly this a man would think, ſhould be ſufficient to ſtir up the Zeal, of a Perſon <hi>whom the Son of God hath given to the Church to be a Teacher of Truth, and who hath bin enlightned by his Grace, and filled with his Spirit, on purpoſe to reſcue and vindicate Truth from the Subtilties, and falſe Gloſſes of Error,</hi> as ſpeaketh one of his Approbationers.</p>
                        <p>THIS I think ſhould be ſufficient to make him prefer the Reputation of his whole Church before that of a ſingle Author, of whoſe name the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41961:19"/> greateſt part of the World is ſtill ignorant. And moreover, as hath bin already ſaid, this Prejudice under which we labour, whether true or falſe, makes a diſtinction between the intereſt of this Treatiſe, and thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, for it puts a ſtop to all the pretenſions of the Author, and bereaves him of all the Conqueſts he promiſed himſelf. For to regain the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi>'s Reputation, will be to no purpoſe, ſeeing that <hi>Calviniſme</hi> will not give over celebrating <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Victories, and ſtand firm to his Proofs. The Confutation of <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book would be to give ſuch a mighty ſtroak, as would ever ſtop the Mouth of <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> and at the ſame time, raiſe up the Glory of the Catholick Church out of the Duſt. There ought to have bin no waverings between theſe two Parties, and yet Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> this Doctor who hath bin given to the Church furniſhed with ſuch Gifts, betakes himſelf to the writing of a Treatiſe, and ſends the Church away till another time.</p>
                        <p>IN ſhort, to finiſh the juſtification of my yet unproved Suppoſition, I need but propoſe the Example of a man who, to ſhew me the Victorys which the Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> hath obtained againſt us, if we have any Reaſon left us, ſuppoſeth without proving it, that the Proofs of this Book are plain and ſolid. If I ſhould apply to him Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Maxims, and tell him <hi>that provided he may have the Liberty which he immediately makes uſe of, inventing and ſuppoſing what he pleaſeth, he is in a ſure way to conclude thence what he will, that theſe kind of diſcourſes founded on unproved Suppoſitions, are not wholy judicious,</hi> and that they ſhew he knoweth not how <hi>to diſtinguiſh between the things which he is not permitted to aſſert till he hath proved them, and thoſe which may be juſtly ſuppoſed without being proved.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IF this man reply to me, he has only made this Suppoſition to oblige Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> to acknowledg he hath no other means left to defend himſelf, but by ſhewing (if he can) the Reaſonings of this Treatiſe are not juſt; May I not then juſtly retort upon him, that I only ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Proofs are plain and firm, that I may thereby force the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> to confeſs he hath no other way left him to defend himſelf, but to ſhew, if he be able, that theſe Proofs are invalid? Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> perhaps would be ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable as not to deny me the liberty of making uſe of theſe Principles, and ſo much the rather becauſe there is a very material and advantagious diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence on my ſide, ſeeing, as already mentioned, I am Reſpondent in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; whereas this Perſon would be the Aggreſſor. But you will ask me, who this man is, that is ſo little acquainted with Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Maxims? Even Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> himſelf, who having produced a long train of Arguments in the fifth and ſixth Chapters of his firſt Book; to ſhew us that the <hi>Learned, and Unlearned, the Simple, and Obſtinate, and all Perſons in general ought to acquieſce in the Proofs of the</hi> Perpetuity, he thereupon makes this Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>'Tis true,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that theſe Arguments being applyed to the Book of the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 1. Ch. 6. pag. 62. pag. 63.</note> Perpetuity, <hi>ſuppoſe the Proofs are clear and ſolid; and therefore I make uſe of them in this place to remove theſe vain Exceptions of Mr.</hi> Claude, <hi>who would have them rejected without examining them, on this general Reaſon, That they are Argumentative Proofs. Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>hath no other way of defending himſelf than by ſhewing, if he can, the Arguments in this Treatiſe are not ſound.</hi> We ſhall ſee by what follows, whether he had reaſon to make this Suppoſition, I ſhall content my ſelf at preſent with concluding according to his Example, that every man may make Suppoſitions, provided he intends not thereby to end the Debate, but only oblige an Adverſary to come to the Diſcuſſion
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41961:20"/> of that Point which he is not willing to meddle with. And thus doth Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> cenſure in another that which he doth himſelf.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>That the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi>'s Method may be justly Suſpected to be deceitful, and that his manner of aſſaulting Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book is Diſingenuous.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE Method the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> makes uſe of to make us confeſs, as he ſays; <hi>that the Doctrine of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, touching the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>is the ſame with that of all Antiquity,</hi> hath appeared ſo ſtrange and irregular to me, that I have made theſe following Reflexions thereupon.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. That it may be juſtly ſuſpected of Artifice and Illuſion.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. That this way of Aſſaulting Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book is Diſingenious and Indirect.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. That the Author hath bin to blame in pretending to ſhew the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Proofs by Arguments which at moſt do amount but to mere Conjectures.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. That to confute at once all theſe Arguments, we need but oppoſe againſt them theſe ſame Proofs of matters of Fact, and by gathering them into an Abridgment, to give a general view of them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> confeſſes that I were not to be blamed for having in my Anſwer <note place="margin">Lib. 1. ch. 1. P. 1.</note> fall'n firſt upon the Faults which I pretend to diſcover in the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi>'s Method, <hi>provided,</hi> ſaith he, that <hi>I maintained Equity and Truth;</hi> It may be, I think, then ſuppoſed I have ſo far done nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Rule, it only remains I make good the four above-mentioned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall not inſiſt long upon the firſt of theſe, becauſe Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged <note place="margin">The firſt Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation juſtified.</note> nothing againſt it, appearing undenyable in it ſelf. It is grounded on this, That when the Queſtion concerns what we ought to believe touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> would have this Queſtion decided, not by the word of God, but the Churches Conſent in all Ages, and Depoſitions of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and when it comes to the Enquiry after this Conſent of the Church, he would have this ſecond Queſtion reſolved not by Paſſages taken out of the Writings of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> but by Arguments. Now this is certainly a moſt tedious and prepoſterous Courſe; it being a Principle of common Senſe, that Queſtions in matters of <hi>Right</hi> ought to be naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by the Rule of <hi>Right,</hi> then when the Rule determining that Right is diſtinct and ſeparated from matters of Fact, and that again naturally the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41961:20"/> Queſtions in matters of Fact ought to he decided by an exact Conſideration of the Facts themſelves, or by Witneſſes who can make a lawful Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
                        <p>Seeing then the Chriſtian Religion offers us a diſtinct Rule, and that too as it lies ſeparate from matters of Fact; (which is that holy Scripture, wherein God hath made a full Revelation of his Will;) it is in it we muſt ſearch for what we ought to believe, and not in the conſent of the Church in all Ages. For as the <hi>Fathers</hi> thought they were obliged to ground their Belief on the Scriptures, ſo likewiſe we, who have the ſame Faith with them, ought to ground our Faith on the ſame Principle. The Scripture hath been given us to determine thereby our Apprehenſions of the Myſteries of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but their Belief who preceded us can be no more at fartheſt, than an Example for us to Imitate, and an Example too ſubmitted to the ſame Rule, which requires no farther our Approbation than it agrees with that; ſo that to decide Queſtions of this Nature by the Examples of former Ages, is to pervert the natural Order and Deſign of things.</p>
                        <p>IT will be to no purpoſe to alledge The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will not allow the Scriptures to be the only Rule of our Faith, ſeeing it likewiſe taketh in Tradition. Yet this Anſwer will not clear the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> from that Reproach with which I ſhall charge him: For when a man lays down a Method in a Controverſie, and propoſes it as ſufficient to convince thoſe who are not of his own Opinion, he muſt ground this Method on Principles grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by both Parties; for if his Poſitions are ſuch as may be queſtioned, he is then obliged to a ſolid Proof of them, before he can ſuppoſe them. For if he take not this Courſe, he will quickly be at a loſs, and his whole Work ſoon rendred ineffectual. Now this the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> has not done, for he has not proved that the Conſent of all Ages ought to be our Rule in matters of Faith. 'Tis true he has told us of the ill Conſequences which would follow the condemning the <hi>Antient Fathers,</hi> and that we ſhould do, if we ſuppoſe them guilty of an Idolatrous Worſhip. But this reaches not our Queſtion: for it doth not hence follow that their Writings are the Rule of our Faith, neither in the matter of our preſent Debate, nor in any other: For the <hi>Fathers</hi> may be free from damnable Errors in any Article of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, by the agreement their Doctrine hath with that Rule which enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to believe, without becoming a Rule themſelves and without arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this ſupreme Authority over mens Conſciences, which ought to decide all Queſtions of this Nature.</p>
                        <p>But perhaps it will be replyed that, provided we attain the knowledge of the Truth in what we ought to believe concerning ſo important a Subject as that of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> what need we matter, by what means we obtain it, whether by means of the holy Scripture, or by Conſent of the antient Church? If we follow not the <hi>Fathers</hi> as the Rule of our Faith, let us follow them then as an Example held out for us to imitate. To which I anſwer, That the cauſe which I have taken upon me to defend would in the main loſe nothing, though we ſhould take the Belief of the Antient Church in this matter for the Model and Rule of ours, ſo that this doth not at all trouble us.</p>
                        <p>BUT be it as it will, we muſt not forſake the Word of God, nor wholly build our Faith on any other Principles but thoſe which are drawn from the Holy Scriptures. Our Faith would not then be what it ought to be, that is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41961:21"/> to ſay, A Divine Faith, were it but an imitation of the Belief of the <hi>Fathers.</hi> This Maxim of regulating our Religion by an Imitation of them who have preceded us, without having any fixed Principle, is certainly of very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Conſequence. For 'twould happen at length after ſome Ages, that the laſt would have no reſemblance with the former, becauſe that humane Imperfections which commonly mix themſelves in ſuch an Imitation, would never be wanting to diſorder and corrupt it, as is commonly ſeen in the drawing of a Picture, Draughts of which being taken one from the other, become ſtill every time leſs Perfect, as they are fartheſt diſtant from their Original.</p>
                        <p>THE Author then of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> cannot be excuſed for his perverting the order of the Diſpute with which I charge him, that he would decide this Queſtion of Right by matters of Fact; Neither is he leſs inexcuſable when he would have the Queſtion of matter of Fact, to depend on the force of his Reaſoning. The matter before us is to know what has bin the Opinion of the <hi>Fathers</hi> touching the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and he pretends to decide this Queſtion not by the Teſtimony of the <hi>Fathers</hi> themſelves, but by certain Impoſſibilities he imagines in the change which we ſuppoſe. I know very well that there are ſometimes Enquiries made into matters of Fact, the Truth of which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be atteſted by any Witneſs, and I confeſs in this caſe, no man can be blamed for having recourſe to Reaſonings, becauſe there being no other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to help us in our Search, even Neceſſity warranteth this way of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, altho it be indirect. But we are not in theſe Circumſtances, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we have the Writings of the Antients, and thoſe no leſs conſiderable for their Number than for the many clear Paſſages they contain touching the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt;</hi> which if we will apply our ſelves unto, we ſhall ſoon diſcover their Opinions about it. What need is there then, for us to leave our enquiries into the Opinion of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> to hearken to the Author of the <hi>Perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>'s Arguments? May we not now juſtly complain of him, and anſwer him, this is the way of Inquiry which Nature it ſelf hath preſcribed us, and comparing theſe two ways, the more natural appeareth to us to be the more direct and certain. From whence it immediately follows, That his manner of proceeding, may well be ſuſpected as artificial and deceitful, for it is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual with us to ſuſpect that Perſon who leaves the common Road, to walk in by-Paths.</p>
                        <p>MY ſecond Obſervation on the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi>'s Method, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects <note place="margin">The ſecond Obſervation juſtified, Lib. Chap. 1. p. 4.</note> the manner of his Aſſaulting Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book. And ſeeing Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> hath charged me with falſity, for affirming Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s <hi>Book hath chiefly occaſioned this Controverſie, and that the Author of the</hi> Perpetuity <hi>hath ſet upon it after an indirect manner.</hi> I am thereupon obliged to divide the Subject of my juſtification under two Heads. I ſhall firſt then make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book hath bin aſſaulted, and hath bin the firſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this Debate. Secondly, that his Book has bin Aſſaulted after an unjuſt manner.</p>
                        <p>THE firſt of theſe Particulars ſhall be diſpatched in two Words, for on one hand I have no more to do, but only deſire the Reader himſelf to peruſe the ſecond Section of the firſt Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> where he ſhall find that in fifty one Pages which it contains, his whole deſign is only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute Mr, <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Account of the <hi>Innovation</hi> which hath hap'ned touching Tranſubſtantiation: And on the other, I have no more to do but declare to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41961:21"/> the World, That from the firſt Moment of our Debate, which was preciſely then when I began to anſwer this Treatiſe, I propoſed to my ſelf not only particularly to maintain the Truth of this Account, but defend in general the whole Book, againſt the indirect attempts of that <hi>Treatiſe.</hi> Now if this may not be called the firſt occaſion of this Conteſt, I know not any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er how to name things. For what is there which maketh a Book the firſt occaſion of a Debate, which is not here? Muſt a Book be aſſaulted? this hath bin ſo. Muſt it be defended? this hath bin ſo. Ought he who takes upon him the Defence of it, to do it with a deſign of keeping up its Credit? This hath bin likewiſe my Deſign, becauſe its Intereſts have appeared to me to be the ſame with thoſe of the Truth. Where then is this <hi>notorious Falſity</hi> with which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> chargeth me?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>THE Author of the</hi> Perpetuity, ſaith he, <hi>never pretended his Treatiſe was</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 1 Chap. 1 Pag. 4.</note> 
                           <hi>a refutation of that Miniſters Book, and in a matter as this is, which dependeth on the Intention of a man yet living, it were ſufficient to convince Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>of raſhneſs to tell him, as from him, he is mistaken, and that this Author never deſigned what he charges him with. Moreover he adds, That this Treatiſe was primarily intended only as a Preface to the Office of the bleſſed Sacrament: and that we ſeldom find any man undertake to refute a Book in Folio, in a Preface: That he handleth the Queſtion of the Impoſſibility of an Innovation: That he refuteth</hi> Blondel <hi>and</hi> Aubertin <hi>by the way, who had impoſed fabulous Relations on the World: And that he directly indeed argueth againſt Mr.</hi> Aubertin'<hi>s pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Innovation, but medleth farther with no other part of his Book.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> I hope will pardon me, if I affirm that there's not one word of Truth in all this. For, to ſpeak properly, the occaſion of this Conteſt can be no other but that taken from the Obligation I had to enter into this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, ſeeing our Debate began but from that time I interpoſed. For had I not ſtept in between, the Author had talked only to himſelf, and when a man does ſo, we are not wont to ſay, ſuch a one is in a Diſpute. To find then the real Occaſion, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſhould have ſought it in the cauſes mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to interpoſe, and not in the <hi>Author of the</hi> Perpetuity'<hi>s</hi> Intention. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> hath not conſidered there is a Difference between the Occaſion of a Debate, and whether the Subject of it be real or imaginary. For to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the latter of theſe Particulars, we muſt look back to the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> and conſider what he has done, and what he would do, but to be aſcertained in the firſt of them, I ought thereupon to be conſulted: and when it ſhall appear I was deceived by a groundleſs Imagination that Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book hath bin aſſaulted, then it might be truly affirmed I raiſed a Quarrel to no purpoſe, ſeeing the occaſion of it only ſprang out of my own Fancy, but yet what I have ſaid ſince cannot be charged with <hi>notorious Falſity, viz.</hi> That this Book was the firſt occaſion of the Debate betwixt us, ſeeing that in effect I only engaged in this Controverſie to defend it.</p>
                        <p>THERE is moreover in Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Diſcourſe a falſe Suppoſition in the Term of <hi>Refuting,</hi> for he ſuppoſeth I charge the Author of the <hi>Perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> with a deſign of formally and directly refuting Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s whole Book, and 'tis thereupon he tells us, that ſeldom any man undertakes to refute a large Folio in a Preface. But he does not conſider, that I did not for this reaſon uſe the Term of <hi>Refuting,</hi> but <hi>Aſſaulting,</hi> and that far from charging the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> with this Deſign of a Refutation, my complaint hath bin on the contrary, that he has not refuted this Book, and which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41961:22"/> hath been grounded on the Neceſſity urging him to have done it, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter. Now to juſtifie what I ſaid, that Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book hath been the firſt Occaſion of this Debate, and at the ſame time, that this is not an ill grounded Suppoſition, I need not repeat that the Author of the Treatiſe deſigned to refute that whole Book, it appears to me ſufficient he hath aſſaulted the laſt part of it, and undertaken to anſwer it throughout the ſecond Section of his Treatiſe. It ſufficeth me that his firſt Section tendeth to render incredible Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s account of an Innovation. It ſufficeth me, the drift of his whole Work is to make Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Proofs of matters of Fact altogether uſeleſs to us. And this is more than need to be ſaid to refute this fierce Accuſation of <hi>notorious Falſity,</hi> with which Charge Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> hath begun his Book. Now this is apparently true, and a man needs but his Eyes and common Sence to be ſatisfied in it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> may tell us what he pleaſes concerning the Author of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity</hi>'s real Deſign. Yet ſhall I anſwer him, that when men judge of a Work, their Judgment is guided by what appears in the Work it ſelf, and not by the ſecret Intentions of its Author. For mens Deſigns many times lye hid, but the drift of their Work lies open. I do not pretend to penetrate into mens Hearts, yet cannot I be withheld from judging of the Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> becauſe 'tis before my Eyes.</p>
                        <p>THAT this Treatiſe was at firſt, but a ſimple Preface, or that it was not, it avails me little to know, for I am not uſually ſo much in Love with Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as to extend my Curioſity into the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi>'s diſavowed Deſigns. If this Work hath been heretofore but a Preface, and that it hath been ſince raiſed to the dignity of a Treatiſe, there hath been reaſon perhaps for its ennobling, its Deſert hath made it worthy of this Honour; and they are at this day to blame who have reproached it with the meanneſs of its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Condition, in an occaſion, which called for the eſtabliſhment of its Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But be it what it will, <hi>Preface,</hi> or <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> it is all one to me, it aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth never the leſs for this Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book.</p>
                        <p>BUT ſaith Mr. <hi>Arnaud, he refutes it by the way.</hi> By the way, of four ſcore and eight Pages which it contains, there are one and fifty of them imployed in a formal Refutation of Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s account of an Innovation, and the drift of the reſt, as I have already ſaid, is to ſhew that this Account is incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, becauſe tis impoſſible, and indirectly to overthrow the whole Work. So that here I think the charge of our firſt <hi>notorious Falſity,</hi> appears to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true. Let us ſee the ſecond, which is that I affirmed, <hi>The Author of the</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity <hi>hath aſſaulted Mr.</hi> Aubertin'<hi>s Book after an indirect manner.</hi> But to apprehend throughly the truth of this Obſervation, Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s whole Book muſt be granted to be a Diſcourſe only touching the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and which is divided into three Parts. In the firſt he handleth this Subject by Arguments drawn from Scripture, and humane Reaſon. He produceth the Paſſages thereof, and Arguments fetched from thence, and refutes the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers made thereunto, nay he near upon anſwereth whatſoever Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts have ſtated hitherto conſiderable on this Subject. In the ſecond, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amines the Churches Belief, during ſix Centuries, by an exact Diſcuſſion of all Paſſages produced on either ſide, makes it plainly appear that <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,</hi> and the real <hi>Preſence</hi> are Doctrines which have bin unknown during all that time. And in the third, he gives an account after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner their Doctrines have been introduced.</p>
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:41961:22"/>
                        <p>THE firſt part treateth of the Queſtion of Right, ſhewing the true Rules of it, and ſerves as a Foundation to the ſecond. The ſecond Part handleth the Queſtion of matter of Fact, by a faithful depoſition of Witneſſes, that is to ſay, by the Fathers from Age to Age, and ſerves as a Foundation to the third. And the third Part ſhews the Degrees of this Innovation, the Time when it begun, its Authors, and the Oppoſition which it hath met with.</p>
                        <p>THIS being ſo, I ſay, it is an indirect Proceeding, to ſingle out this laſt Part from the ſecond, and attempt the refuting of it alone, as the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> hath done. And the Reaſon is manifeſt, becauſe the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Foundation on which the laſt Part is built, and which communicateth to it all its force of Perſwaſion conſiſteth in its ſecond. For wherefore do we believe, for Example, what it ſaith concerning the Innovation which <hi>Anaſtaſius Sinaite</hi> hath introduced, in reference to Expreſſions, he having bin the firſt that rejected the Terms of <hi>Type</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> on the Subject of the <hi>Euchariſt?</hi> It is becauſe he ſhews us in his ſecond Part, that the <hi>Fathers</hi> who preceded <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> ever made uſe of this manner of Expreſſion, for we find not any one of them who rejected them. Wherefore do we take <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> to be the firſt who ever thought of the real Preſence? The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is becauſe we never meet with any before his time, who thus deliver themſelves. So that the ſecond Part of Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book does neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepare the Reader for the third. In the ſecond Part he ſheweth the State of the Church, for the ſix firſt Ages, to be quite different from what is ſeen at preſent in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> The Reader then thereupon finds there has bin an Innovation, and ſuppoſes it to be not only poſſible, but that it hath actually hap'ned, ſo that it only remains to know, when, by whom, and by what Degrees this Change has bin introduced, and this is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſet forth in the third Part. It cannot therefore be ſingled out from the ſecond to be oppoſed alone, without the greateſt Injuſtice and Diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity; for this is to ſtrip it of all its Strength, and to deal with it, as the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> did with <hi>Samſon,</hi> cut off his Hair before they ſet upon him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi> offered not his Account to the Reader till he had prepared him by a neceſſary Premonition to receive it; Whereas the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> would have it conſidered and examined with an unprepared Mind, or rather, to ſpeak better, with a Mind fill'd with contrary Diſpoſitions. Now this is not fair Dealing. For to proceed orderly, he ought to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun with theſe firſt Preparations; and made it appear (if he could) that they were fallacious, and ſo diſcover the unjuſtice, falſity, or weakneſs of them, and afterwards ſet upon the Account he gives us. Had he taken this Courſe, we ſhould have had nothing to charge him with, touching his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod; but to ſtifle theſe Preparations, and cut 'em off from the Diſpute, and fall immediately upon his Account of the <hi>Innovation,</hi> is that which will ever deſerve the name of <hi>indirect Dealing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>AND if we conſider likewiſe the manner after which the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> hath endeavoured to overthrow this Account, it will be found his Proceedings are in this Reſpect as diſingenious as in the former. As for Inſtance, Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi> obſerves that <hi>Anaſtaſius Sinaite</hi> hath bin the firſt who varied from the common Expreſſions of the Antients, in ſaying, The
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41961:23"/> 
                           <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is not an <hi>Antitype</hi> but the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now to refute directly this Hiſtorical Paſſage, (being agreed as we are in this Particular relating to <hi>Anaſtaſius)</hi> there ought to have bin the like Paſſages produced of them who preceded him, and to have made it thence appear he was not the firſt who thus expreſſed himſelf. But inſtead of this, the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> takes another Courſe, for he demands, <hi>how this can be, That</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Perpetuity of the Faith, P.</hi> 50. 51. &amp;c.</note> Anaſtaſius, <hi>who could not be ignorant of the Churches. Belief in his time, ſhould offer an Opinion which would be formally oppoſed, and this without acknowledging, he propoſed a contrary Opinion?</hi> He indeavours to ſhew this Innovation could not overſpread either <hi>Eaſt</hi> or <hi>Weſt,</hi> and that <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi>'s real meaning, and that of them who ſpake like him in this particular, could not be the Impannation of the <hi>Word</hi> with which Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi> ſeems to charge them. And the ſame doth he, in reſpect of <hi>Paſchaſius,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi> Affirms to be the firſt Author of the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> for inſtead of ſhewing others held the ſame Opinion, and that he did not teach a new Doctrine, he ſets himſelf upon ſhewing, that if <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> had bin an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novator,</hi> he would have bin taken notice of in ſome one of the Councils held in his time, that he would have bin oppoſed, and never offered his Opinion as the received Doctrine of the Church, as he has done. I will not now enquire into the ſtrength of his Arguments, neither will I ſay they ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected for this Reaſon alone, that they are indirect, The Queſtion is here whether this courſe of refuting Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book be warrantable, and it muſt be granted, it is not; for the chief deſign of this his Account be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to demonſtrate, that <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> and <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> introduced Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Now to make it appear they were not Innovators, there ought to have bin produced ſeveral Paſſages out of the Writings of thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded them, which ſhould come near the ſame Expreſſions, or at leaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to the ſame Sence as that of theirs, which the Author of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity</hi> hath not done.</p>
                        <p>LET Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> conſider again then, if he pleaſes, the Queſtion, and whether I have broached two <hi>notorious Untruths,</hi> the one, <hi>that Mr.</hi> Auber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin'<hi>s Book was the firſt occaſion of this Conteſt, the other, that the Author of the</hi> Perpetuity <hi>hath attacked it after an indirect manner.</hi> Now to the end I may have from him a ſecond Sentence more favourable than the former; it will not be amiſs to anſwer his Objections, and ſhew him firſt, That I pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not to hinder any Perſon from chooſing thoſe Points or Matters for which he hath the greateſt Inclination: for, provided he handles them in a regular manner, he will thereby oblige the publick. Secondly I do not ſo much as pretend to hinder any man from refuting part of a Book, and leaving the other, provided this Part may be well refuted alone, and there be no cauſe to complain that the force of the Arguments is ſpoiled by ſuch a ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thirdly, Neither do I take upon me to call the Author of the <hi>Perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to account about his employing himſelf, and require of him two <hi>Volums</hi> in <hi>Folio.</hi> For I am willing to believe his Employs are great and difficult, and therefore afford him not time enough to make a direct and compleat Refutation of Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book.</p>
                        <p>AND as to what he tells us, <hi>that we cannot reaſonably require more from</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 1. Ch. 1. Pag. 7.</note> 
                           <hi>a Perſon who handleth any Subject, than that he ſuppoſe nothing which is Falſe, or Obſcure, and draw not from thence ill Conſequences,</hi> ſeeing the truth and clearneſs of Principles, and the juſtneſs of their Conſequences are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſufficient, to aſſure us of the Truth, and gives us a clear and perfect
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41961:23"/> notion thereof. To which I anſwer, This is true, when Perſons are agreed to treat on this Subject, and do take this courſe to decide the principal Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, for in this caſe, only the Principles and their Conſequences ought to be examined. But if this be not conſented to, but on the contrary there are general Obſervations made upon the Method, then it is not particularly minded Whether the Principles are diſputable or not, nor Whether their Conſequences are true or falſe, for this follows afterwards. The Method of handling the Subject is only conſidered, without regard to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or Concluſions; That is to ſay, Whether 'tis direct or diſorderly, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or againſt Nature, ſufficient to perſwade, and end the Controverſie or not, and on this account, it may be juſtly expected from a Perſon that he take a right Method rather than a wrong, one which is a Natural, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than that which is not ſo. For ſuch a one may well be told, He ſpends his time to no purpoſe, that takes not a right way to obtain the end of what he deſigns. Now this is exactly what we have to alledge againſt the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> as will appear in the following Chapter. We have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to wonder that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſhould deny us the liberty of making theſe general Reflexions, he I ſay, who confeſſed in the ſecond Period of his firſt Chapter, that I am not to blame for having grounded my chief Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi>'s Method, upon the Defects I found therein, provided I eſtabliſh Truth and Reaſon. But this doth not well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with what he ſaies here. <hi>That there cannot be any thing juſtly required of a man who treateth on any Subject, but only this, That he lay down good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and draw thence true Concluſions.</hi> For the falſity of Principles, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, proceeds rather from a defect in the Matter, or Form of an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Particular, than in a Method in General.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>THE third Obſervation juſtified, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Author of the <hi>Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity</hi> has bin to blame in pretending to overthrow the Proofs contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Mr. <hi>Aubertin's</hi> Book, by Arguments which can amount to no more than mere Conjectures.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſeems unwilling to grant, That the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> has endeavoured to invalidate our Proofs of Matters of Fact contained in Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book by his Arguments, and thereupon has only propoſed the Queſtion in theſe Terms: <hi>viz. Whether a man may not argue againſt matters of Fact:</hi> And takes it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Lib. 1. Ch. 2.</note> he may in ſome particular Caſes. It is then our part to ſhew, he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the Point, and that the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> has not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to oppoſe, but even overthrow by his arguings our Proofs of Fact, ſo that the Queſtion now is whether this Endeavour of his is juſt or unjuſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to a regular Courſe or contrary to it.</p>
                        <p>AND for this purpoſe, I ſhall only deſire Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to conſider, That the Deſign of the Method, or advantage expected by it, as it hath bin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41961:24"/> declared in the fourteenth Page of the firſt Treatiſe, <hi>Is to bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unprejudiced Perſon, to acknowledge the Church of</hi> Rome'<hi>s Belief touching the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>to be the ſame with that of all Antiquity;</hi> and this new Method is propoſed to remedy an Inconveniency, uſually attending that ordinary Method, called <hi>Diſcuſſion,</hi> wherein it frequently happens, <hi>that men ſeldom ſufficiently comprehend the ſtrength of Proofs; becauſe they are not conſidered in their right order, which ever ſo placeth them as that they mutually aſſiſt and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie each other.</hi> I need but entreat him likewiſe to remember the firſt Title of the <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> before it was printed, when it was put into my Hands to be anſwered; which was as follows, <hi>A Treatiſe containing an eaſie Means to convince Hereticks, by ſhewing them there has no alteration bin made in the Churches Belief touching the</hi> Euchariſt, as I already obſerved in the Preface before my Anſwer. Laſtly I have no more to requeſt of him, but only to remember the new Title under which the firſt Treatiſe, and them which followed, were publiſhed, which is; <hi>The Perpetuity of the Faith of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church touching the</hi> Euchariſt. For what elſe can be expected from a man that promiſes to make us confeſs, <hi>the Church of</hi> Romes <hi>Belief is the ſame with that of all Antiquity,</hi> and hopes to convince us of the Truth of this, but that he ſhould invalidate all our Proofs of matters of Fact, by which we think we have eſtabliſhed the reality of an Innovation? Would Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> grant me the favour to ſuppoſe a while that I am not obſtinate: and I will likewiſe on the other hand ſuppoſe I was miſtaken in Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book, and that the Perſwaſion I had of the truth of his Proofs concerning an Innovation hath bin falſe. Now ſhould the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that his Method is able to undeceive me and diſſipate all the falſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions which Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Proofs have wrought in my Mind; ſhould he, I ſay, pretend to this, he has imagined, as I have already mentioned, that he is able by his Arguments, to invalidate our Proofs; and again on the other hand, if he pretends not to do this, he hath bin certainly to blame in ſaying, <hi>He would convince Hereticks, and make them acknowledge, (if they are not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibly Obſtinate) the Perpetuity of Tranſubſtantiation, and the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</hi> We ſhall ſee by what follows, whether or no Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the honour of ſo great a Deſign, or whether he has not abated ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it. I ſhall content my ſelf at preſent with only ſhewing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of the Author of the <hi>Method.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IT cannot be alleadged in his behalf, he had not theſe aforementioned Proofs in his Mind, but only offered his own; which he judged concluſive; for beſides that when a man lays down a Method as ſufficient to produce an effect, he ought conſider whatſoever may hinder the producing of this or the contrary Effect. We may farther obſerve he aſſaults Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book in this Treatiſe, wherein are contained theſe Proofs, concerning which he could not pretend Ignorance, ſeeing they make up the greateſt part of that Book. It ought moreover to be conſidered, that he refuteth, as I alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſaid in the foregoing Chapter, an Account whoſe whole ſtrength is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on theſe Proofs of matters of Fact, an Account which taketh them for its Foundation, and borroweth from them whatſoever it would perſwade, and refutes it not in oppoſing other Proofs after the ſame manner, but by Arguments. Whence it follows he imagins his Arguments are ſufficient to overthrow theſe Proofs, it being impoſſible if they ſtand firm, but that the account of the Change or Innovation ſhould do ſo too.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s way of ſhifting the Queſtion that he might draw on the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41961:24"/> Reader to another matter, is ſo plainly evident, that I need not give him the leaſt hint of it. For there is certainly a great Difference betwixt barely <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing</hi> Arguments againſt our Proofs, and pretending to invalidate them by Arguments. The firſt of theſe may be done without thinking on the ſecond; theſe Arguments may be examined and compared with our Proofs, without any other Pretence than the keeping the Mind in Suſpence, and hindering it from determining on either ſide. Had the Author of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity</hi> kept himſelf within theſe Bounds, we ſhould have anſwered him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another ſort; but he hath extended his deſign ſo far as to bring us to a final Acknowledgment. The Queſtion then is not ſo much about his bare Oppoſition; altho that ſhall be ſhewed him at length to be uſeleſs, and that he cannot expect any advantage from it, for the Debate at preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts either in the Juſtice or Injuſtice of his Deſign, when he imagined this Oppoſition was ſufficient to convince us, notwithſtanding our Prejudices againſt it, occaſioned by Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s and other Miniſters Proofs.</p>
                        <p>BUT to ſtate the Queſtion clearly, it ought to be farther ſuppoſed, that we compare not here the Proofs drawn from Arguments, then when they are made uſe of to eſtabliſh Matters argued, with Proofs of matters of Fact, which are intended for a confirmation of the ſame matters of Fact. For I am far from denying, but there may be at ſome times Proofs drawn from Arguments, which are as concluſive in their kind, and bring along with them as much certainty of Evidence, as Proofs of Fact do in theirs. The Debate concerns the comparing theſe two ſorts of Proofs, in reſpect of a matter of Fact; for the Principal Queſtion betwixt us, is whether the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the antient Church is the ſame with that of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at preſent, now this is a matter of Fact, which on one ſide is demonſtrated by Proofs of Fact, and which the Author pretends on the other ſide to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate by Proofs drawn from Arguments; which two ſorts of Proofs form contrary Concluſions on the ſame ſubject.</p>
                        <p>IT is farther to be conſidered, the Queſtion lies not in ſuppoſing our Proofs are frivolous, or uncertain, for then they might be oppoſed by Proofs drawn from Arguments; by pretending that the Fact would be more plainly demonſtrated by this means than by the other. Had the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> made this Suppoſition and well grounded it, we could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer keep to our Proofs of Fact, of whoſe weakneſs and inſufficieney he had already convinced us, we muſt then have hearkned to his Arguments. But we are not in this caſe, for he leaves our Proofs of Fact untouched in their whole ſtrength, and we are perſwaded of the truth and ſolidity of them. It being then thus with us, it remains to enquire, whether his Proofs drawn from Arguments can be ſufficient to make us alter our Judgments. The Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> pretends they are, and I deny them to be ſo, ſo that to decide clearly this Point, we muſt compare theſe two ways of Proving, one with another.</p>
                        <p>I affirm then firſt of all, our Proofs of Fact are regular and natural, as I made apparent in my ſecond Chapter: whereas thoſe of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> are unjuſt and prepoſterous. Now to compare theſe two Methods one with another, that which is natural is leaſt ſuſpicious, for there can be nothing ſaid againſt it, common Senſe leads us to it, but the other is ever lyable to Exception, by reaſon of its contrariety and obliquity. The
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41961:25"/> latter of theſe leads a mans Mind by ſeveral Turnings and Windings, and the other makes it go ſtraight.</p>
                        <p>MOREOVER, our Proofs of Fact demonſtrate the matter immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in it ſelf; but Proofs drawn from Reaſon cannot do this, but by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect thro other things, and by means of Connexions and Conſequences; Now it cannot be denyed, but of theſe two ways of knowing things, the one being immediate, and the other mediate; the one near, and the other diſtant, but that the firſt of theſe is the moſt diſtinct and certain: for not to ſay, that the Ideas of things grow weak, when they are diſcovered by a Medium, and that the Mind is more attentive, and ſo by conſequence more diſtracted, and leſs able, when it is forced, to apply it ſelf at the ſame time to three dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Objects, <hi>viz.</hi> on the Concluſion, Principle, and Dependance which the Concluſion hath on its Principle, than when it hath but one only Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to conſider; beſides this I ſay, the orderly Connexion of things being leſs known to us than the things themſelves, it is eaſier to take for a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence what is not one, than to take one thing for another. It is eaſier to deceive us by affirming, if an Alteration hath hap'ned, there muſt ſuch and ſuch Accidents have followed it, than it is by only telling us, <hi>Loe here the Alteration,</hi> and certainly a man is in leſs danger of being deceived this way than the other.</p>
                        <p>WHEN two Methods are offered as proper to demonſtrate a Queſtion in Debate, it ſeems to me, that a mans Reaſon will incline him to chooſe that way which brings him to the conſideration of the Point debated in all its ſeveral Relations and Circumſtances, rather than that which ſhews it him but in one. The Mind muſt be permitted to make ſeveral Reflections, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe divers Reflections ſtrengthen one another, and uniting together, they form a more extended and perfect Knowledg, even as ſeveral Rayes uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted give the greater Light. Now it cannot be denyed but our Proofs of Fact have this Advantage over them of the <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> For the latter of theſe reſpects no farther than the only impoſſibility of an Alteration; and concludes from thence, that the Doctrine of the Antient Church hath bin the ſame with that of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at preſent. But our Proofs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Belief of the Antient Church, in all the ways it can be examined in it ſelf, by its neceſſary Conſequences, by its Conſequences of Congruity, by way of Negation, and Affirmation, by Circumſtances of Time, Places, Perſons, and Occaſions, and in a word, after all manners imaginable, whereby the Mind may form a more ſolid and certain Judgment. What likelyhood is there then, that being already perſwaded by a conſiderable number of Proofs, which this Method draws from all theſe Particulars, we ſhould receive a contrary Impreſſion by the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi>'s Arguments?</p>
                        <p>A greater humane Certainty than that of Sence cannot be found, now that of Reaſoning falls commonly under this Degree, eſpecially when we apply it to matters of Fact.</p>
                        <p>BUT when Proofs drawn from Arguments ſhall be extended to the ſame Degree of Conviction, as thoſe of the Eye-ſight, and common Sence, they can never aſcend higher, or proceed ſo far as to convince us, and make us renounce their Evidence. It ſeldom happens that theſe two Lights juſtle one another, but when this falls out, a mans Mind never fails of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41961:25"/> one part or the other, it may remain for ſome time interdicted and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed; but unleſs ſome vain Philoſophy, as that of the <hi>Academicks,</hi> or <hi>Pyrrhoniens</hi> has corrupted it, and made it wander, it will ſoon rally it ſelf on the ſide of common Sence. I will produee an Example drawn from <hi>Phyſicks.</hi> Our Eyes and Sences ſhew us that a grain of Sand is not only fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, but far leſs than a Mountain, or the whole Globe of the Earth; yet there are People who endeavour to demonſtrate by the force of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that this little grain of Sand comprehends an infinite number of Parts actually exiſtent, becauſe it may be divided <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> and it is not, ſay they, well conceivable how a thing can be ſo divided, if there be not in it actually an Infinity of Parts, ſeeing each Diviſion ſuppoſeth the actual Exiſtence of its Parts, from whence it ſeems, that this grain of Sand is as bigg as a Mountain, and the whole World beſides, it being impoſſible, ſay they moreover, there ſhould be a greater and larger heap than that which actually contains an Infinity of Parts. I doubt not but a mans Mind would be ſoon entangled in this Labyrinth, but he would extricate himſelf thence, not by the help of his Senſes but his Reaſon, he will turn it on every ſide, and invent Diſtinctions which will ſignifie nothing, as are the greateſt part of them which have bin made on this Subject; yet will he ſtill keep firm to his Eye-ſight and common Senſe.</p>
                        <p>IT will be replied perhaps, that unleſs we are extream Obſtinate, we cannot pretend our Proofs of Fact are of this kind, which is to ſay, that they have the certainty of our Senſes; for they are taken from the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> whoſe Faithfulneſs may be called in queſtion, by ſetting up this fantaſtical <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> mentioned by Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> which is, <hi>That all our Paſſages are falſe, and invented by the Diſciples of</hi> John Scot, or elſe in ſaying, that the <hi>Fathers</hi> are miſtaken, or ſome ſuch like matter, which may <note place="margin">Lib. 1. Ch. 2. Pag. 1.</note> make the Truth and Validity of theſe Proofs to be called in Queſtion; and moreover that our Paſſages are not ſo plain, but they may well be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, ſeeing there have bin great Volums written concerning them on both ſides. To which I anſwer, in ſuppoſing two things which ſeem to me, to be both undenyable by Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> we can pretend againſt him our Proofs of Fact have ſuch a kind of Certitude, as is that of our Senſes.</p>
                        <p>MY firſt Suppoſition then ſhall be, That the Writings of the Fathers are faithful Witneſſes of the Belief of the Antient Church. He cannot diſagree with me in this Point, for we have not receiv'd it but from them of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they produce it themſelves, and we uſe it only out of Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion to them, not having need, as to our own particular, of any thing but the Word of God to regulate our Faith in this Myſtery of the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> And when this Point ſhould be queſtionable, yet muſt then the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> put it out of Queſtion by his refuting of it, before he propoſes to us his Arguments, and not having done it, we are at liberty to act againſt him on this Principle. The other Suppoſition we muſt make is, That we know very well, what is the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> Belief touching the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,</hi> and that we rightly apprehend it, ſo that there is no danger of our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in this matter, and this is that which hath never yet bin diſputed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us. In effect, we neither ſay, nor imagine any thing on this Subject, more than what we find in Books, and hear diſcourſed on every Day, which is, that the whole Subſtance of Bread is really converted into the Subſtance of the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the whole Subſtance of Wine into the whole Subſtance of his Blood, there not remaining any thing more of the Bread
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41961:26"/> and Wine but their meer Accidents, which are not ſuſtained by any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and further, that the Subſtance of our Saviour's Body, is really preſent at the ſame time both in Heaven and Earth, on all the Altars whereon this Myſtery is celebrated: that they which communicate, eat and drink this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with the Mouths of their Bodies, and that it ought to be Worſhipped with the Adoration of <hi>Latria.</hi> This is undenyable.</p>
                        <p>I ſay then, on theſe Grounds, we have reaſon to preſume our Proofs of Fact are evident even to Senſe it ſelf. For we read the ſeveral Paſſages of the <hi>Fathers</hi> which ſpeak of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> our Eyes behold them, and our Senſes are Judges of them. But there are not any of theſe Articles to be met with, which do diſtinctly form the Belief of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, neither in expreſs Terms, nor in equivalent ones. We are agreed in the Contents of theſe Articles, and in what they mean; we are likewiſe agreed of the Place where they were to be found, in caſe the Antient Church had taught them. We know likewiſe, that it belongeth to our Eyes and common Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe to ſeek them, and judge whether they are there, or no; for when a Church believes and teaches them, ſhe explains them diſtinctly enough to make them underſtood, and we muſt not imagine they lie buried in far fetched Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or couched in equivocal Terms which leave the Mind in Suſpenſe; or wrapt up in Riddles, from whence they cannot be drawn but by hard Study. If they are in them they ought to be plain, according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Capacity of an ordinary and vulgar Underſtanding. Yet when we ſeek them, we cannot find 'em: if they were ſet down in expreſs Terms, our Eyes would have diſcovered them; had they bin in Equivalent ones, or drawn thence by evident and neceſſary Conſequences, common Senſe would have diſcovered them. But after an exact and thorow Search, our Eyes and common Senſe tell us, they are not to be found in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. This altho a Negative Proof, yet is it of greateſt Evidence and Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. After the ſame manner as when we would know whether a Perſon be at home, we are agreed both touching the Houſe and the Perſon, that one might not be taken for the other; and after an exact Search, if a mans Eyes and Senſes tell him that he is not there, the proof of a Negative Fact hath all poſſible Force and Evidence. Yet we are upon ſurer Terms, for a man may eaſily hide himſelf in ſome corner of his Houſe, and ſteal away from the ſight of thoſe that ſeek him; and therefore the Negative Proof ſerves only in this Reſpect, to juſtifie we have made a full and thorow Search. But if the Articles of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Creed were eſtabliſhed in the univerſal Conſent of all Ages, (as is pretended,) it would not be ſufficient they were hid in ſome one of the <hi>Fathers</hi> Writings, they muſt near the matter have appeared in all of them; whence it follows, our Negative Proof is yet more certain, by the Confirmation it receives from an Affirmative Proof, which conſiſteth in that our Eyes and Senſes find out many things directly Oppoſite to theſe Articles, and theſe two Proofs joyned together do form one, which appeareth to be ſo plain and intire, that there needs nothing to be added to it. And yet this is it which the Author of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity</hi> doth pretend to ſtrip us of by his Arguments. But let him extend his Pretenſions as far as he will, I believe he will find few Perſons approve of them, and who will not judge, that even then when our Eyes ſhould have deceived us, which is impoſſible after ſo diligent and careful a Search, the only means to diſabuſe us would be; to deſire us to return to the uſing of them again, and to convince us our Inquiry hath not bin ſufficient, we ſhould at leaſt have bin ſhewed what we our ſelves were not able to find.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41961:26"/> For whilſt nothing is offered us but Arguments, they will do us no good, we may be perhaps entangled with them, if we know not how to anſwer them, but they will never make us renounce the Evidence and Certainty which we believe to be contained in our Proofs of Fact.</p>
                        <p>WE are confirmed in this Belief, when we conſider the Nature of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi>'s Arguments. For they are not Demonſtrations which convince a mans Mind, or of equal force with them which appear in our Proofs; being at fartheſt but mere Probabilities. They are Moral Impoſſibilities which he finds in the Alteration we ſuppoſe; as tho it were not poſſible but that the Biſhops and others of the Clergy, together with the People, would have oppoſed theſe Innovations, and diſturbed the Peace and Unity of the Church, under ſo great a Contrariety in their Opinions; and many ſuch like things doth he alledge, which are not grounded on any certain Principles, nor drawn from undeniable Conſequences. In general, its a hard matter to determine which are impoſſible Events, if you except them which carry along with them a palpable Contradiction; for the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or Principles of things are at a great diſtance from us, we know little of them but by their Effects, and theſe Effects not always ſhew themſelves at the Bottom, ſo that a man cannot poſitively ſay, this can be, or this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be. Moral Impoſſibilities are for the moſt part doubtful, eſpecially thoſe grounded on the Inclinations of the People, whoſe ways are many times ſo uncertain, and have ſo little of Uniformity in them, and ſo great Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on particular Circumſtances, that we cannot take any certain Rules from thence. Had the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> ſhewed us, That the Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration we ſpeak of, doth imply a Contradiction, That 'tis contrary to the Nature of things, That there follows from it evident and intolerable Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, we ſhould then have examined his Arguments without troubling our ſelves with his Method. But to tell us what the Clergy and People would do in this, this can amount to no more, at fartheſt, but meer Conject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures, and even Conjectures very uncertain; for he is not the Arbitrator of all humane Actions, neither doth he know all their Principles and different Intereſts, nor underſtands all the Cauſes which concur in great Accidents, or all thoſe things which hinder them from hap'ning.</p>
                        <p>IT is then a great piece of Injuſtice to deſire, our Proofs of Fact ſhould yield to his way of Reaſoning, and I hope Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will not take it ill that in making uſe of his own Terms, and accomodating them to my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I tell him, <hi>That 'tis in vain that he conteſteth, and heateth himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 10. Ch. 7 Pag. 55</note> 
                           <hi>this Subject of an Alteration. Arguments ſignifie nothing in matters which are obvious to Senſe, and we can make them appear to be ſo in this Caſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IT remains, for the finiſhing of this Chapter, I ſhould ſatisfie ſome of <note place="margin">Lib. 1. Ch. 1 P. 10.</note> Mr. <hi>Aruands</hi>'s minute Obſervations. The firſt of which is, <hi>That it is every whit as bad to oppoſe vain Arguments againſt Proofs of Fact which are firm and ſolid, as to object ſolid and convincing Arguments againſt vain and Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous Proofs.</hi> But there is no body who doubts of the Truth of this, and this is not the matter in Queſtion. When he ſhall have made it appear our Proofs are vain and frivolous, he ſhall be permitted to oppoſe againſt them his Arguments: Yea, and call them ſolid and convincing ones, 'till ſuch time as they be refuted. But our Proofs muſt always be begun withal, their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41961:27"/> weakneſs and vanity laid open, for without this we ſhall ſtill be at liberty to hold them for good, firm and Concluſive.</p>
                        <p>HE addeth, <hi>That not only Proofs of Fact are Invalidated by Proofs of Reaſoning; But likewiſe, that Proofs of Fact are reducible in ſome ſort to Proofs of Reaſoning; and even all of 'em grounded on Arguings like unto thoſe of the Author of the</hi> Perpetuity, <hi>that is to ſay, on the impoſſibility of certain Events, and that 'tis from theſe Arguings they borrow whatſoever they have of Solidity.</hi> And this he proves by the Example of the literal Proofs taken from Hiſtory, to eſtabliſh certain matters of Fact, and by the Proofs of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Miracles, and the Refurrection of our Saviour; concerning which the humane Certitude depends on a Moral Impoſſibility, which yet is not perceivable but only by force of Reaſoning. From thence he concludes, <hi>That a Proof is not to be Rejected, becauſe it is called a Proof drawn from Reaſon; no more than it is to be believed, becauſe 'tis called a Proof of matter of Fact; but that both one and the other are contemptible, or eſtimable, accordingly as they are Obſcure or Evident, True or Falſe, Slight or Solid, and that 'tis on the Quality of a Proof and not by its Kind, we ought to form our Judgment.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>TO which I anſwer, we muſt diſtinguiſh two kinds of Proofs of Fact, the one Immediate, the others Mediate; the Immediate depend on our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the Mediate conſiſt in the Depoſition of Witneſſes. The certainty of the firſt of theſe doth not depend on Arguments, it being evident in it ſelf by its own Nature and Original; for in that we believe our Senſes; this Perſwaſion cometh not ſimply from Reaſons dictitating this to us; but becauſe their Teſtimony is perſwaſive in it ſelf, and that we cannot doubt of the things we ſee, unleſs we have corrupted our own Natures by a ſtrange Extravagancy.</p>
                        <p>AS to the ſecond kind of Proofs, we muſt conſider them either abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or in their Circumſtances; if abſolutely it is clear, their Certitude de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth on Arguments, for we do not give Credit to Witneſſes, but only upon the account that Reaſon dictitateth we ought to believe them. Yet doth not this hinder them from being commonly ſtronger, in reſpect of the Fact they prove, than the Reaſoning grounded on the ſame matter of Fact; and that which diſtinguiſheth them is not their ſimple kind, but the Matter, or Subject to which they are applyed, ſeeing that an Argument is more Juſt and Certain, when it eſtabliſheth the Fidelity of Witneſſes, than when it would decide the Fact it ſelf concerning which the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes make their Depoſitions, whence it follows that the Teſtimony autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed by ſtronger Arguments, ought to be preferred before thoſe which are weaker. And after this manner do we prove the Truth of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Reſurrection, beauſe the Teſtimony of the Apoſtles, being grounded on mighty Arguments, ſtands more firm, than all that the Wit of man is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to deviſe againſt it. But if the Proof taken from Witneſſes is attended with this Circumſtance, that is to ſay, that the Fidelity of the Witneſſes be agreed upon, and that this be an acknowledged and uncontroulable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, then, I ſay, this is no longer a Mediate Proof, but an Immediate one, it depending no longer on Arguments. For the Validity of a Teſtimony being a Point once decided, which ent'reth not into the Proof, but only as an undoubted Principle, it then remains only to know what the Witneſſes depoſe, and this is a Matter of which we may be informed by our Senſes,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41961:27"/> whence it follows, we muſt examine their Teſtimony, and that this way is to be preferred before that which is Argumentative on the ſame Fact.</p>
                        <p>IF we conſider the <hi>Fathers,</hi> not in reſpect of their own Belief, but as Witneſſes of the common Belief of the Church, I confeſs, their Authority dependeth on Reaſonings, and that it may be queſtioned; but beſides, it would not hence follow that the Proofs drawn from Arguments in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that is to ſay, on the Churches Belief, would be more certain than their Teſtimony, ſeeing their Teſtimony may be eſtabliſhed on a Reaſoning ſtronger than theſe Proofs, and conſequently may be preferable to them. I ſay, beſides all this, this Point of the Fidelity of the <hi>Fathers</hi> is a Principle, we have the Advantage of ſuppoſing againſt Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> ſeeing that hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath never queſtioned it, and that we take the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> only from his Hands, and deſcend to the Examination of their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony only out of complyance with him, as I have already mentioned: ſo that to ſpeak properly, we have no more to do, but only to know what hath bin their Doctrine. Now this is another matter of Fact, of which we think we can be informed by our Eyes, and by the Light of common Senſe, and we cannot imagine without a great Miſtake, that there hath bin more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity and certainty, in the Proofs drawn from Arguings; whence I may conclude again, that we are at Liberty to reject theſe Proofs, without troubling our ſelves with any farther Examination of them.</p>
                        <p>IT appeareth then clear enough (I think) that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s ſecond Chapter is but a vain Amuſement. And I cannot but be troubled, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf obliged to alleadg ſeveral things which cannot but be grievous to them who ſhun Contention. But I could not but mention them, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> to the end he might not take Advantage by my leaving him unanſwered.</p>
                        <p>WHAT he ſaies concerning pretended Proofs of Fact, <hi>viz.</hi> That they are often invalidated by Proofs fetched from Arguments, toucheth not our Queſtion. For there is no body denys that Reaſon doth not ſometimes cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect a Miſtake in Senſe; and ſometimes again invalidates the Depoſition of Witneſſes, whether by making it appear that theſe are Falſe-Witneſſes who impoſe on us, or elſe in ſhewing they themſelves are miſtaken, or laſtly that their Teſtimony contains quite another thing than what is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. But altho that Proofs of Fact ought to be tried by Arguments, to know their Goodneſs, yet doth it not follow that when the Queſtion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects a matter of Fact, but that the way of Proofs is to be preferred before that of Arguments, on the ſame Subject; it doth leſs follow that when Perſons are prevented by Proofs of Fact, that they can be made to alter their Judgments, by ſimple Proofs drawn from Arguments, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhewing them that their pretended Proofs of Fact are not good. What he addeth concerning the Proofs of Fact, that they are all of 'em redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible in ſome ſort to Proofs of Reaſoning, is not true, in reference to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Proofs, and whatſoever there may be of Truth in this, yet is it uſeleſs, becauſe the Queſtion is not about a general Compariſon of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with Proofs of Fact, but concerning the Compariſon applyed to the Fact it ſelf, which the Proof eſtabliſheth, and which lies now in Debate. All the following Diſcourſes, touching the Fidelity of Hiſtorians, the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Canes,</hi> of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> of <hi>Philippes, Actium, Caeſar, Pompey,</hi> and the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41961:28"/> 
                           <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> are Digreſſions which our Diſpute hath nothing to do with. The Proofs of the Truth of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Miracles, and them of the Reſurrection of our Saviour, are good, but they belong not to our Subject. If the Queſtion concerned the proving the Fidelity of the <hi>Fathers</hi> Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, we would conſent to the making uſe of Arguments, after the ſame manner as they are made uſe of to prove the Fidelity of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Teſtimony. But this is not the Point, our whole Queſtion is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to know what the <hi>Fathers</hi> have believed; and for this, Arguments are far leſs fit than Paſſages faithfully collected from their own Writings. Mr. <hi>Arnauds Hypotheſis,</hi> that all our Quotations of the <hi>Fathers</hi> have bin foyſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them by <hi>John Scot</hi> and his Followers, is, as he is pleaſed to expreſs it on another Occaſion, a <hi>Fantaſtical Hypotheſis,</hi> from whence he can draw no Advantage, and what at fartheſt can have no Ground but in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of the Paſſages themſelves. And laſtly his Concluſion that the Proofs of Fact, and the Proofs taken from Arguments, are either to be valued or ſlighted, as they are either Obſcure or Evident, Falſe or True, Vain or Solid, and that 'tis by the Quality of the Proof, and not by the kind of them that we muſt judge, this is I ſay a diſingenious Concluſion, for it is true that Proofs are eſtimable or deſpicable by their Quality, and not by their Kind: but their Kind and the Matter to which they are applied ſerve to foreſhew us their Quality, and their Quality being foreknown, rendreth them Eſtimable or Contemptible. A Proof drawn from Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, being made uſe of to ſubvert a matter of Fact, which is found e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed by the ſight of our Eyes and common Senſe, bears, in this ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Compariſon, a ſufficient Number of falſe Characters, to make us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that it belongs to the number of thoſe ſubtile and looſe Proofs Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> mentions, <hi>which evaporate of themſelves, and vaniſh out of the Mind,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 1. C 2. P. 10.</note> 
                           <hi>as the Ayr doth out of our Mouths,</hi> it not being neceſſary to enter into a more particular Examination of them. Seeing then we have Reaſon to ſuppoſe our Proofs are good and Subſtantial, as I made it apparent in my firſt Chapter, we may likewiſe well conclude in this, that the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi>'s Reaſonings are vain and groundleſs, and conſequently to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected without troubling our ſelves any farther with them.</p>

                           <hi>as long as he will, that the Alteration in Queſtion is poſſible, in making it appear if he can, That it hath actually hapned. He may deny the Impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a thing, by proving its actual Exiſtence. All this is allowed him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are we ſo unreaſonable, to deprive him of theſe kind of Proofs. He wrongs the Author of the</hi> Perpetuity, <hi>in charging him with ſuch a Thought.</hi> This Acknowledgment is not of ſo ſmall Importance, but that it deſerves to be conſidered; for it perfectly overthrows the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Deſign, and makes all thoſe great Hopes he conceived of his Method, to vaniſh away, in two or three Periods. We have allready ſeen that he hath offered it, as a ſufficient Means to convince us; and make us confeſs, <hi>by the Evidence of Truth, if we are not deſperately Obſtinate, that the Church of</hi> Rome'<hi>s Belief touching the Myſtery of the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>is the ſame with that of all Antiquity.</hi> But this Diſcourſe do's not well agree with that of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s. For, if this Method will lead us ſo far on one Hand, as the making of us come to this laſt Confeſſion, mentioned by the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> the Diſpute ends there, and our Proofs of Fact are Inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant, ſeeing they are Succors which will ſtand us in no ſtead, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready overthrown. And on the other, if we may employ our Proofs of Fact againſt the Method, provided we make a right uſe of them; if we may deny the Impoſſibility of an Alteration, in ſhewing it hath actually hapned; we have at leaſt the Power to Suſpend this Acknowledgment, to which the Author of the <hi>Method</hi> would oblige us, until ſuch time as it is examined whether we make a right Uſe of our Proofs of Fact, and draw a true Concluſion from them. But how ſhall we make theſe two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men agree? Seeing one of 'em would have the Diſpute ended by his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; and the other would have us keep it ſtill up by our Proofs of Fact. The one pretends, we ought to reckon our ſelves Vanquiſhed as ſoon as ever he has done ſpeaking, and the other gives us time, and allows us to produce our Paſſages. If we Expound the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi>'s Meaning by Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> he hath undertaken no more than the bringing us to make this forementioned Acknowledgment, Excluſively; for between his Proofs and our Confeſſion, we may put in our Proofs of Fact, which is to ſay in ſhort, that he hath ſuppoſed his Method able to effect any thing, but what it ought. And if we expound Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Meaning, by that of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> he deſigns, that we ſhall not make uſe of our Proofs of Fact till ſuch time as we acknowledg there hath no Alteration hapned; which is to ſay, that he will not grant us the uſe of them, til we
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41961:29"/> confeſs, they are of no uſe to us. So that ſhould we comply with both theſe Gentlemen, we oppoſe and contradict our ſelves; for we muſt then acknowledg that we have bin to blame, and yet at the ſame time maintain that the Reaſon is on our ſide: And ſo again we ſhall acknowledg, the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the ſame with that of the Primitive Church, and yet ſtill prove that there hath bin made an eſſential Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And thus are we guided by theſe Gentlemens Speculations.</p>
                        <p>TO ſpeak ingenuouſly, I take Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to be a very bad defender of the <hi>Method;</hi> for he not only forſakes it in a Capital Queſtion, wherein its Honour is chiefly concerned, (which is to know whether it be ſufficient to Convince us in the State we are in, and make us confeſs the Truth of what it proves) but he moreover expoſes the Uſeleſneſs and Vanity of it; for if after all his Endeavours, we may ſtill return to our old Proofs of Fact, I ſee not any Uſe that can be made of it; unleſs it be to entangle and length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en out our Debate, wherefore I think it may well be laid aſide, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it content himſelf with his Method of <hi>Diſcuſſion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>NOW to clear up this Diſpute, it will not be amiſs to examine here, what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> tells us touching theſe two ſorts of Methods of <hi>Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>Diſcuſſion. The Method of</hi> Preſcription, ſaith he, <hi>is that in which, by the Examination of certain principal Points, the Controverſy is decided,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 1. C. 3. P. 16.</note> 
                           <hi>the other is that in which is particularly laid down the Proofs of all the Matters debated, and all the Objections againſt them anſwered,</hi> From thence he takes occaſion to diſcourſe of the Advantages which the Church hath over us by theſe Methods of Preſcription; and afterwards coming to a Concluſion, <hi>It is neceſſary</hi> addeth he, <hi>For the Method of the</hi> Preſcriptions <hi>keeping its Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and producing the Benefit expected from it, that it remain ſeparate from the Method of Diſcuſſion, becauſe otherwiſe we ſhould inevitably fall into Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity, and the Perplexity of particular Examinations, which we intend to avoid. So that, whereas the Diſcourſes deſigned for the Diſcuſſion of particular Matters, ought to be written with the greateſt Exactneſs, no difficulty, which may perplex the Mind being omitted in them; So on the contrary, thoſe which are made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Method of Preſcription, ought preciſely to contain no more than may ſerve to illuſtrate the Proof which a Man intends to make uſe of, and it would certainly be a great Defect to joyn thereunto the Examination of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Queſtions, which do but confound the Mind by their Multiplicity.</hi> At length he concludes, <hi>That the Author of the</hi> Perpetuity <hi>could not with Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence undertake to anſwer Mr.</hi> Aubertin'<hi>s chief Difficulties in his Treatiſe. That had this Treatiſe bin made according to the Method of Diſcuſſion, he had bin in a manner obliged thereunto, but being a Method of Preſcription he could not do it without ſpoiling his Deſign, and evidencing he underſtood not the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Advantage of the Method he followed, which was ſhort, perſpicuous, and accommodated to all Capacities.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>ALL this Diſcourſe is nothing to the Purpoſe, for by it we underſtand no more than this, that when men conſent to make uſe of the Method of <hi>Preſcription,</hi> they muſt only ſerve themſelves with it according to the Rules which it enjoyneth. Very good! But this decides nothing if we are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, but on the contrary, diſpute againſt it, for then the Queſtion is no longer, how we ought to uſe the Method of <hi>Preſcription,</hi> nor whether it ought to be joyned with that of Diſcuſſion, this is no longer the Point, but the Queſtion is only whether we ought to uſe it or not. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41961:29"/> impoſes on his Readers, he carries them off from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from the matter in Queſtion, to that which does not concern it, and thereupon entertains them at his Eaſe. We do not diſpute the manner after which the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> ought to have ordered his Method of Preſcription, ſuppoſing this were a proper Place for it, this is one of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Deluſions; but our Diſpute lies, whether he could reaſonably uſe it againſt our Proofs, even ſo far as to promiſe the Effect which he hath pretended to draw from thence. Now this is a Difference which hath bin already diſpatched by what I repreſented in the foregoing Chapters. And in effect, ſeeing he would convince us there hath bin no Alteration made touching the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> notwithſtanding we are prepoſſeſſed to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, by literal Proofs, how can he, I ſay, take from us this Perſwaſion, and give us another quite contrary to it, unleſs his Method of Preſcription hath an Evidence and Certainty beyond that of the Proofs aforementioned? This he ought to ſhew us, and not ſtraggle into the common place of Methods of Preſcription. But this would be to undertake to ſhew a thing impoſſible; for a Method made up of Proofs taken from Arguments: all of 'em drawn from a <hi>genere probabili,</hi> as the Schools term them, could not ſurmount the ſtrength of our Proofs of Fact, which depend on the ſight of our Eyes and common Senſe, a great part of which propoſe the thing imediately in it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>BUT how then? may we never eſtabliſh our Sentiments by a Method of Preſcription? We do not ſay ſo. We only mean thus much, that when the Sentiments of Perſons are oppoſed, which are grounded on Proofs of Fact, and which they believe to be (as I have already ſaid) as certain as any thing which falls under the Judgments of their Senſes, it is then I ſay an unreaſonable thing, to pretend to make them alter their Opinion by a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Preſcription, grounded on moral Impoſſibilities. This is the Knot of the Queſtion. If a man hath to do only with People prepoſſeſſed in favour of his Opinion, he may then uſe his Method of Preſcription, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them in the thoughts they have already entertained. There could no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be alledged againſt his manner of Proceeding, the ſtrength of his Proofs are in that Caſe only to be conſidered. If he has to do with indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Perſons, that is to ſay, with ſuch who have not yet taken any ſide, and deſire to be inſtructed, he might then likewiſe uſe a Method of Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, provided his Principles be well grounded, and his Concluſions more deciſive, than any thing which can be alledged againſt them; There need then be nothing to be replied, unleſs there were ſomething indirect in his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod; but this could do no more at fartheſt, but only oblige People to examine with greater Care the Truth of his Principles, and that of its Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and not make them reject them; for indirect Arguments conclude ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with as great Evidence as direct ones. Nay I will not fear to ſay, that when he ſhould have to do with Perſons prepoſſeſſed with Opinions contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to what he would perſwade them, he might then lawfully uſe a Method of Preſcription, for it would not be ſufficient to ſay that a man is prepoſſeſſed by another Method, nor object that that of Preſcription proceedeth indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, or follows not the Order of Nature, theſe kind of Objections may cauſe Suſpicion; but they ought not to proceed ſo far, as to make men abſolutely reject Arguments, which perhaps, are attended with a greater Perſpicuity and Certitude, than thoſe which have occaſioned the Prejudice. But as to what concerns us, againſt whom the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> hath written, we are in none of theſe Circumſtances; being not only
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41961:30"/> led by a natural and direct Way in my <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> and by Proofs which propoſe us the Point in Queſtion immediately in it ſelf; but by Proofs which we believe to be above all Contradiction, and yet he would have us change our Minds, by Proofs which are not only indirect and mediate ones, and which at fartheſt can amount to no more but meer Probabilities, being appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Subject in hand. We have then Reaſon to ſay, that theſe are mear Chimeras in our reſpect, and that without conſidering them any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than in their own kind, and in the matter on which they treat, they cannot make ſuch a ſtrong Impreſſion on us, as to deface that which we have already received; for 'tis not likely that any rational Man will be more affected with Probabilities, than with ſolid Proofs which are grounded on common Senſe.</p>
                        <p>MOREOVER this is not the proper Place to make Compariſons, of the Methods of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> with them of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> It may be made apparent that we have ſurer and ſhorter ones than thoſe which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth. But this is not our Queſtion, and I am reſolved not to follow all Mr. <hi>Arnauds</hi> fruitleſs Digreſſions. His Words coſt him nothing, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are diſpoſed to receive them, be they what they will, as Oracles. But 'tis not the ſame with me, for, ſhould I wander from my Subject as often as he does, there would be few Readers who would not be tired with our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. I ſhall only tell him, he is miſtaken when he imagines that to be of our Communion, a man is obliged to an examination of all the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies which to this day have perplexed the Chriſtian Religion. We have the holy Scriptures which every man may read, or hear them read pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly: Which do fully and clearly contain whatſoever is neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and by the Concurrence of Gods Grace, even the moſt illiterate may judge whether the Miniſter, under whom they live, is able and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſhew them the way of Life, and whether our Society be the true Church. For in this Caſe we need but examine two things. The firſt whether we are taught in it all things clearly contained in the Word of God, and ſecondly, if there be nothing taught which corrupteth the Strength and Efficacy of theſe things; for if we find in this Communion wherewithal to ſatisfy our Conſciences, and to live in the fear of God, and to aſcertain our ſelves in our Saviours Promiſes: and moreover, if nothing be taught or practiſed which overthroweth the fundamental Doctrines of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> For if nothing doth offend the Conſcience, we ought to be perſwaded, we are in the true Church, it being needleſs for us to enter into a Diſcuſſion of all the Errors which have troubled, or ſtill perplex the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner as 'tis not neceſſary to Salvation, for a man to know all the particular Hereſies which have troubled the Peace of the Church, nor to make a formal and poſitive Renunciation of them, for it is ſufficient that we are not tainted with any of them, and firmly to believe the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Truths of Religion, neither is it likewiſe neceſſary to aſſure our ſelves, we are in the true Church, that we inform our ſelves of the ſeveral Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of men: It may ſuffice us to know that the Church of which we are Members, teacheth what it ought, concerning Gods Glory and our Souls Edification, and maintains nothing which doth not anſwer theſe Ends. Now this every man may find in our Church, for if he compare his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters Doctrine with the Word of God, he will be ſatisfied that what he teacheth is exactly contained therein, he ſhall perceive likewiſe that we mix no Doctrines of men with it, which overthrow its Foundation. This way of Examination is ſhort, eaſy, and proportionable to the Capacity
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41961:30"/> of all People, and thereupon there may be made a Judgment, as certain as if every ſingle Controverſy had bin examined apart.</p>
                        <p>THE moſt ſimple then among us may live in perfect Peace; But it is not ſo in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for theſe Methods of <hi>Preſcription,</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> are not built but upon one of theſe two Principles, either that the Church, which is to ſay, the Body of the People, cannot err, nor ceaſe to be the true Church, in ceaſing to believe what it believes, or in beginning to believe that which it did not believe; or that the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Church, that is to ſay, the <hi>Councils,</hi> or the <hi>Pope,</hi> cannot err. The firſt of theſe two Principles is natural; the ſecond is of a Supernatural Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. I handle not at preſent this Point, whether they are falſe or true at the Bottom, it ſufficeth me to ſay that they are in their own Nature ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and require ſo much time, that to expect ordinary Apprehenſions to examine them, is plainly to deride them: I ſhall ſpeak of the firſt of theſe in the ſixth Chapter: where I ſhall make it appear that 'tis impoſſible for a man to extricate himſelf out of thoſe Perplexities wherein the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> engages him, or to reſt ſecure on the Grounds on which it's built. It ſuffices me to ſay, that People are not commonly ſo regular in things, which they believe by a diſtinct Faith, but that they are willing likewiſe to receive new Doctrines, and enlarge by this means the number of popular Myſteries. The Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> tells us, that the Truths of Divine Grace were never popular in all the Conſequences drawn from Theology: and yet we know that all imaginable care has bin taken to make theſe Conſequences popular. There has bin made on this Subject, I know not how many Books adapted to Womens Capacity; there have bin Catechiſms compiled, intit'led Catechiſms of Grace. Which evidently ſhew, it has bin believed, that it was not impoſſible to make the People re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve by way of Illuſtration or Addition, Articles which they knew not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whence it follows it has bin ſuppoſed they are capable of Change; for elſe to what purpoſe ſerve theſe Catechiſms, if the People cannot of themſelves, either diminiſh, or augment the number of Myſteries which they hold by a diſtinct Faith. This Principle is not then ſo certain, but that it may be doubted of, nor ſo clear, or evident in it ſelf, that the moſt ſimple may be aſcertained in it, having before their Eyes a Matter which appeareth ſo contrary to it.</p>
                        <p>AS to the ſecond, it is evident that the Queſtion of the Infallibility of Councils, or Popes, is not ſo eaſie, that the moſt ſimple People may maſter it. All Societies ſeparate from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> oppoſe it. If this Church hath this, ſhe hath it by a particular Priviledg, which muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined before it be received. For it cannot be entertained on the bare word of this Church, without falling into an extravagancy and ridiculous Circle, which is, that we believe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be Infallible, becauſe ſhe ſaies ſo; and we believe what ſhe ſaies in this matter to be true, becauſe ſhe is infallible. Before that the moſt ſimple People can acquieſce in its Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, this Authority muſt alſo appear to them to be undeniable, by things independent on the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and which may be judged of diſtinctly by themſelves. Otherwiſe this would be to begin an Argument by its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. For this would be near the matter ſuch a kind of reaſoning as this is. That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is Infallible in what ſhe ſaith; now ſhe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth ſhe is infallible, from whence it follows that ſhe is ſo. A perſon in whom we ſuppoſe there is the leaſt Dram of Senſe, will never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41961:31"/> by this Argument. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> then muſt firſt make out its priviledge of <hi>Infallibility</hi> to the moſt ſimple man living, before it can be ſuppoſed that ſuch a one, or any other will receive its Doctrine, founded on this Principle. Now I affirm that this Diſquiſition is beyond the reach of mean Capacities, for if it be proved by way of Scripture, it is not ſo plainly deſcribed therein, but that the Places on which it is grounded may be capable of another Senſe. They are controverted Places, and a man muſt read whole Volums to prevent his being raſh or paſſionate in his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now if a man be able to make ſuch a Diſquiſition, and a Judgment accordingly, he will then be able to enter upon the Examination of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Doctrines, and to diſcern the Conformity which each of 'em hath with the Scripture, in relation to what is produced on either ſide.</p>
                        <p>NOW if this Doctrine be attempted to be proved by Arguments: he that endeavours to do this, engageth himſelf yet farther into tedious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixities, and Difficulties, which ſurpaſs ordinary Apprehenſions. In a word Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> doth himſelf decide the Queſtion. <hi>This Infallibility,</hi> ſaith he, <note place="margin">Lib. 1. C. 7. P. 66.</note> 
                           <hi>is not a thing clear in it ſelf, ſeeing it dependeth only on the Will of God, which he hath made known unto us by the Scripture. The Church not being naturally Infallible, we muſt prove that it is ſupernaturally ſo, either by the Principles of Faith, or by a long Series of Arguments.</hi> Ordinary Capacities are not able to examine this long ſequel of Arguments, nor ſufficiently to diſcuſs the Principles of Faith, to diſcern if this pretended Infallibility may be drawn thence. And 'tis for this Reaſon, that the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> hath choſen rather to take the popular Infallibility for his Principle, than that of Priviledge. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> teſtifies as much; for ſpeaking of the Impoſſibility of the Churches altering its Belief on the Articles which are not popular, that is to ſay, of this Infallibility of Priviledg now in Queſtion. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>doth not clearly ſhew us this Impoſſibility.</hi> So that this Author (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity) being deſirous to ground his Arguments on</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 1. C. 7. Pag. 68.</note> 
                           <hi>a Principle of Reaſon and humane Evidence, and not on a Principle of Iraditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Authority, or on abſtracted and remote Arguings, he muſt then neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily contain himſelf within the reach of things, in which the Impoſſibility of a Change appeareth plainly by Reaſon. There are particular ways of proving that the Church never fell into an Error, on any Point which it propoſeth. But it's evident to Senſe, that the whole Church cannot fall into Errors, relating to matters of Faith, ſeeing they are diſtinctly known and understood by all the Faithful.</hi> The Infallibility then of Priviledge is not a thing which is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately apparent to Senſe, there needs more abſtracted and remote Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove it, whence it appears that Perſons of ordinary Capacities are not able to do this. Much leſs are they fit for this, ſhould this Point be undertaken to be proved by the way of Tradition, for it would be to ſend them far enough, in obliging them to read the Fathers and Councils, to be informed in this matter; beſides that the Fathers and Councils are themſelves the repreſentative Church, and whoſe Authority is now in Queſtion and ſo conſequently, their Teſtimony upon this account would ſignify no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                        <p>IT is then manifeſt, that common Apprehenſions not being able to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain themſelves in the Infallibility of <hi>Priviledge,</hi> as I come now from proving, nor in the Point of popular Infallibility, as I have already hinted, and which I ſhall do more fully in the end, they cannot remain in the Church
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41961:31"/> of <hi>Rome,</hi> with a ſafe Conſcience, there being nothing which holds them in it but deceitful Bands, ſuch as are, Birth, Education, Intereſt, Cuſtom, and the Example of others, which are things very unproper to determine an honeſt Mind in matters of Salvation. They are then obliged to range them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the ſide of the Reformiſts, from whom they receive for a Rule, things clearly contained in the Holy Scripture, and where they may be aſſured there is none of them withheld in the publick Miniſtry, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, where there is nothing taught which corrupteth the Efficacy of Gods Grace. If it be replied, that we muſt firſt, ſatisfy ſuch Perſons by proving the Divinity of the Scriptures. I anſwer firſt, that this Principle doth not fall under Debate, ſeeing the matter in hand relates not to the ſeveral Religions in the World, but only to the particular Opinions of Chriſtians, for they all in general acknowledg the Divine Authority of the Holy Scriptures. Secondly, I anſwer, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is no leſs obliged to prove this Authority of the Scriptures, than other Churches, ſeeing that before ſhe can make her ſelf acknowledged as Infallible, ſhe muſt evidence her ſelf to be a Church, which ſhe cannot do, if the Divinity of the Scripture be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed her, and ſhe will not take the Pains to prove it; beſides that all the Proofs by which ſhe pretends to eſtabliſh her Infallibility, depend either mediately or immediately on the Scripture, and conſequently they ſuppoſe its Divinity. But in fine, I ſay the Characters of Divinity, which ſhine in all parts of theſe Writings, are ſo lively, and ſo many in Number, that the moſt ordinary Capacities cannot but be affected with them, if they apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Conſideration of them, with a pure Heart and unſpotted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Now this is it, to which the meaneſt Capacity is obliged, as well as the greateſt, and if they do it not, their Damnation is juſt, and their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety without Excuſe.</p>
                        <p>AND this is what I thought I was obliged to ſpeak, briefly on theſe pretended Methods of Preſcription, this not being a proper Place to handle this Point more largly. But to return to the principal Subject of our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, we are obliged to Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> in that he takes it not ill, I endeavour to prove by ſeveral Paſſages, that the Alteration pretended to be impoſſible, is real and true. The Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> muſt likewiſe conſent to this, ſeeing Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> hath ſaid it; and if he doth agree to it, he muſt ſuffer me to draw this Conſequence, that I could have hindred the Effect he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf from his Method, which is, <hi>to make us confeſs if we are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Obſtinate, that the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>touching the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is the ſame with that of all Antiquity.</hi> This Confeſſion cannot be juſtly extorted from us, as long as there ſhall be any reaſonable Occaſion of diſputing this Point between us, and the Production of ſome Paſſages of my Writings, ſtarteth a particular Debate, which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> approveth, for he only complains, I have not produced them in a right manner, but mained, and diſlocated from their Conſequences, and that I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed all thoſe which might be oppoſed, and underſtood. But this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint is Unjuſt, and he ſhould not conceal the Reaſon I alleaged to juſtify the form of my Abridgment, which is, That that Book was made in Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that of Mr. <hi>Aubertins,</hi> whoſe Proofs I take upon me to defend. If he did not like to inſert <hi>two large Volums in Folio,</hi> into a Preface, neither have I liked to put a great Volum into a ſhort Anſwer, which contains no more than thirty Pages.</p>
                        <p>I never pretended that my Abridgment alone, ſhould abſolutely determine
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41961:32"/> his Thoughts. I know this cannot be expected; but I was willing to ſhew the way which muſt be taken for the finding out of the Truth, which is to make an exact Search into the Belief of the Fathers; I deſign'd to ſhew them of my Communion, what might be objected againſt the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi>'s Arguments, and thereby obliged him to diſpute henceforward in a regular manner, we may be permitted to make Abridgments of this kind, and that of mine hath nothing but what diſtinguiſheth it from that which we call <hi>A Heap of Difficulties,</hi> the matters of Proof with which it is furniſhed, their Nature and Force, do contribute that Truth to it, which an Abridgment ought to have, and the relation it hath to Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book makes it evident and certain. There can be nothing more required to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is not the ſame with that of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and that there has bin made an Alteration, for the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this are marked out, and their Conſequence doth plainly appear, that exact perſpicuity which ought ever to accompany Arguments is in the Book to which we refer the Reader; Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> need not conclude then, <note place="margin">Lib. 1. C. 4. P. 30.</note> that there are Difficulties in the Doctrine of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> for we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily conclude from what I ſaid, that the Doctrine of the Antient Church hath not bin the ſame with that which is taught at this Day by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> His Miſtake lies in that he has only read theſe kind of Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which allways refer to another work, in ſuppoſing that the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples they mark out are clearly eſtabliſhed in that Book, to which they refer, and from whence they draw their Concluſion. And this is all that can be deſired in this matter, but yet this is a way of concluding; and concluding too quite another thing than what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> imagined, <hi>viz. That there are Difficulties in the</hi> Euchariſt. I confeſs that to determine his Judgment, we muſt not regulate our ſelves only by this Concluſion, we muſt go to the Spring, and ſee whether what is ſuppoſed iſſues thence; but it doth not thence follow, that the Abridgment is in fault, nor that it ſhould be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a <hi>Heap</hi> of <hi>Difficulties;</hi> and indeed it would not be an Abridgment, if in effect it did not abridge ſome other work, wherein the Matter is handled at large.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>Heap</hi> of <hi>Difficulties,</hi> to ſpeak properly, is a Collection of ſeveral Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections which are formed againſt a Doctrine, without examining either the Grounds on which this Doctrine is eſtabliſhed, nor the Proofs or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by which it is recommended, nor the Anſwers which may be made againſt theſe Objections, and in ſhort, without ſuppoſing any other work wherein all theſe things are handled. It is certain that in a Controverſy, this manner of proceeding is confuſed and captious, and ought not to make any Impreſſion on a rational Mind. But it belongs to Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> to ſay whether the Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> is not of this Kind; for as to my part, I find that it hath all the Characters of it. For being a Collection of Objections againſt our Belief, touching the Change which hath happ'ned concerning the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> of moral Impoſſibilities heaped up one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without any examination of the Grounds or Proofs of our Belief, nor of the Anſwers which may be made concerning theſe Impoſſibilities, and without any Suppoſition of another Work. For to tell us, as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> doth, <hi>that he ſends us back to all the Catholick Books,</hi> this methinks, ſeems to be a kind of ſhifting and evading, and is not ſufficient to protect the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> from that juſt Title I have given it of a <hi>Heap</hi> of <hi>Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</hi> Now if this Author meaneth all the Books written by Catholicks, when ſhall I be able to judge of them? This will be perhaps when I have
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41961:32"/> run thro above two hundred Volums. And if I ſhould ſay on the other ſide, that my Abridgment after the ſame manner, ſuppoſeth all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Books, and I ſend all Perſons to them; Our Readers without Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would be very well informed and edifyed.</p>
                        <p>BUT ſaies Mr. <hi>Arnaud, People do not uſe to call Matters which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly handled, a</hi> Heap <hi>of</hi> Difficulties, <hi>but thoſe things which are hard to be</hi>

We will receive them whenſoever he will pleaſe to give 'em us; but we ſhall not be in haſte to make that Confeſſion, to which the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to oblige us, till we have ſeen them; and in the mean time, becauſe Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will have it ſo, we will have once more the Pleaſure, or rather the Pain of examining (altho it be needleſs) the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi>'s Proofs. I ſay becauſe Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would have it ſo, and not becauſe the reaſon of the thing requires it; for what he alleageth <hi>concerning the Paſſages of my Book, that they contain but an indirect Anſwer to the Author of the</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity'<hi>s</hi>

Whence it follows that he ought at leaſt to have begun by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of our Proofs.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>The pretended Advantages of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> attributeth to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> Examined.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>ALTHO the Conclſion which I have drawn from Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Confeſſion, in the preceding Chapter, is clearly enough eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet do I not think he will be ſatisfied, till I have examined what he ſaith in the fifth and ſixth Chapters of his firſt Book. He will tell us without doubt, that it doth not hence follow we ſhould defer the rendring our ſelves up to the Arguments in the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> altho I have ſtill the liberty of oppoſing againſt them our Proofs of Fact, and that this he hath clearly ſhewed in theſe two Chapters I laſt mentioned. Let us then ſee what he ſaies in them; and judge of them without Partiality.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> imediately meets with a Difficulty, <hi>For I much marvel,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>has not obſerved when a point of Doctrine, as this in Queſtion,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 1. C. 5. P. 32.</note> 
                           <hi>is eſtabliſhed on one ſide by conſiderable Proofs, and on the other by Proofs which are believed to be valid, that we muſt if we intend to judge aright, compare theſe contrary Proofs together, and prefer the ſtrongeſt before the other;</hi> from whence we may conclude, that it will always be neceſſary to come to that which the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> will not yield to, which is, to examine our Proofs of Fact; For to ſolve this Difficulty, he ſuppoſeth; firſt, that they who read the Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> have their Sentiments alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy wholly formed on the Proofs of Fact, produced by Mr <hi>Aubertin</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miniſters; but that theſe Sentiments are not Uniform, becauſe ſome judge of them from what they are in themſelves, others by what they have heard of them, and by external Circumſtances, which give them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what they ought to believe concerning them. That ſome do eſteem them, others on the contrary ſlight them, and others again are in a Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Indifferency, He afterwards repreſents us with a <hi>Calviniſt</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionary,</hi> (for ſo is he pleaſed to call us) who being diſſatisfied with the Scripture and Fathers, by reaſon of the uncertainty wherein he findes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by harkning to different Voices, which call to him from all ſides; and moreover leſs ſatisfied with the Divines of either Party, who cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent him in the Solutions which they give to the Paſſages of their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; he thereupon turneth himſelf towards the Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> which ſhews him, that the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and the real Pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſence, have bin received by the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Churches, and in all other Societies, which are equally Enemies both to the <hi>Latins</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Impoſſibilities which are in this inſenſible Change, which the Miniſters have invented; whereupon this <hi>Calviniſt</hi> determines, in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking all theſe Doubts, to believe the ſame which is believed thro out all the Earth, ſeeing the whole World would never believe it, if it had not derived this Faith from the Channel of Tradition. And for as much as this Contrivance could not be well ended, unleſs I were brought in as a Party, he therefore introduces me, with my <hi>Aubertin</hi> in my hand oppoſing this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. But my Mouth is imediately ſtopt, being told, that theſe Proofs
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41961:33"/> are Unſatisfactory, and thus am I ſent away with my <hi>Rhetorick</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſmes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT this being no more than a Suppoſition, it muſt be eſtabliſhed. And for this Effect, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> calls to his Aſſiſtance ſeveral learned Divines from <hi>Germany, Switzerland, France,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> by whoſe Suffrage he concludes, that the Fathers are rather againſt us than for us, in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> or that at leaſt, the Proofs taken from Paſſages out of their Writings are very uncertain. And ſo here is already the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing People among us convinced, and as for others that are not able to make a Judgment themſelves, they muſt have recourſe to Perſons of greater Knowledg, by which means both the one, and the other, are obliged to rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er themſelves up to that Evidence which appears in the Treatiſe of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity,</hi> becauſe our Proofs of Fact cannot be accounted by them, but as unevident and uncertain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and moreover this Treatiſe being fitted to all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, and grounded on the Light of common Sence, it may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by all in general. This is the Summary of the fifth Chapter.</p>
                        <p>IN the ſixth Chapter, he extends his Pretention a great way farther, for having gained the Learned and Unlearned to his ſide, he will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer even thoſe who are obſtinate amongſt us to eſcape his Hands, <hi>It not</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 1. C. 6. P. 53.</note> 
                           <hi>being neceſſary for this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to enter into an Examination of all thoſe Paſſages, without which Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>would make us believe that the Treatiſe of the</hi> Perpetuity <hi>can prove nothing.</hi> But leſt this Pretention ſhould at firſt amaze People, obſerve after what ſort he declares his meaning. He ſaith then, that our Proofs of Fact appearing to us evident on one hand, and the Proofs of the Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> on the other; theſe two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Evidences neceſſarily cauſe a ſuſpenſion of our Judgments, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from determining, and throw us upon Doubts and Uncertainties. And thus far tends the Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> which leading us hither, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> takes us in hand and tells us, we cannot any longer refuſe to leave our Sect, and paſs over to the <hi>Catholick</hi> Religion, firſt becauſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Maternal, Original, Succeſſive, and Catholick So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, from which we muſt never make aſchiſme. Secondly, becauſe we muſt ever be fully convinced of this Churches Errors, before we ſeparate from it, and at the ſame time have a full certainty of the Purity of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety we are of, to keep in it. Thirdly, becauſe the Church is in Poſſeſſion of the Miniſtry, of the ordinary Vocation, and Authority, and that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters who have not been above a hundred years ſtanding, have none of theſe things. Fourthly, becauſe that People of ordinary Capacities amongſt us, being obliged to yield themſelves to the Proofs of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> and conſequently to return to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they ought to ſerve for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to the Judicious, it being impoſſible for us all not to return to this Society, to which the greateſt part of Men muſt neceſſarily belong. Laſtly he confeſſeth, that all theſe Arguments ſuppoſe the Proofs of the Treatiſe are clear and ſubſtantial, and maintains that be may reaſonably make this Suppoſition, to convince me I have no other way left to defend my ſelf, than by ſhewing theſe Proofs of the Treatiſe are Invalid, and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence I ought not to beat the Ayr as I have done, by declaming againſt the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi>'s Method.</p>
                        <p>AND thus have I Epitomiz'd theſe two mighty Chapters, in which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> hath taken care to illuſtrate the glorious Deſigns of the Author
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41961:34"/> of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> and this perhaps being one of the moſt important Points in his whole Work, he has therefore ſpent thereupon the greateſt part of his Wit and Eloquence. Yet howſoever it comes to paſs I know not, we are ſo different in our Apprehenſions, that having beheld the explication of all this curious Project, I have found nothing at all therein of Reaſon, nor co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence of Parts, neither in his Suppoſitions nor Conſequences, and this I ſhall briefly and clearly manifeſt.</p>
                        <p>FIRST, methinks that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> impoſes on the World, in propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing as it were from us, a Difficulty, which weakens our Cauſe, altho it do's not concern us. For I do not pretend that one of our Communion, into whoſe Hands ſhall be put the Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> and who is able to read it, is abſolutely obliged, before he forms his Judgment thereupon, to make a particular Compariſon of our Proofs, with thoſe of that Treatiſe; I maintain that he may reject theſe laſt, by the general Conſideration alone which he may make, without entring into the Examination of each Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, becauſe that in this general View he will find ſufficient Grounds for rejecting them, <hi>viz.</hi> That they amount to no more but bare Probability, nor cannot equal our Proofs of Fact in Clearneſs and Solidity, which are ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on common Sence. Whence it follows that the Proofs of this Treatiſe ought not to be admitted, and that if we take the trouble to examine them, 'tis out of Condeſcenſion, not Neceſſity.</p>
                        <p>IN the ſecond place Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has not exactly reckoned up the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ranks of Men, who may profitably read the Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> For the greateſt part of them in our Communion, judging this Peruſal needleſs, will not mind it, for they will neither have Leaſure nor Curioſity enough for this; the Title alone will diſguſt them without proceeding any farther. But then he will ſay that theſe are unjuſt and obſtinate Perſons. <hi>We believe it a Point of Raſhneſs to judge of a piece of Ground before we have</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 1. C. 6. P. 26.</note> 
                           <hi>heard the Owners Experience of it; would it not then be a more inexcuſable Raſhneſs to pretend to judge of a Difference which reſpects our Salvation, by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments offered only on one ſide, in ſuffering our ſelves to be tranſported by the firſt Impreſſions? The leaſt which ought to be done by them, who pretend to judge of Differences in Religion; is to hear both Parties, and weigh their Reaſons.</hi> I anſwer, that theſe Perſons I mentioned, will act very Juſtly and Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably in doing what I ſaid. For there being two Queſtions, the one touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what we ought to believe concerning the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and the other touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what has bin believed by the Primitive Church. The firſt Queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once diſpatched, we need not trouble our ſelves about the ſecond. Now as concerning the Perſons in our Communion, the firſt Queſtion is ſolved to them by the Word of God. For this is the Fountain and Rule of our Faith. This is it which judgeth us all, and had the Author of the <hi>Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity</hi> guided his Reaſonings by this Principle, there is not one of us but would gladly hearken to him; but inſtead of this, he immediately tells us of nothing but the Conſent of all Ages, and perſwades himſelf, that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward the Miniſters will be no more hearkened to, when they ſay in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that we muſt only apply our ſelves to the Word of God.</p>
                        <p>THIS Queſtion touching the Conſent of all Ages, may be decided three ways; Firſt, by the Rules of Chriſtian Charity; Secondly, by the Confidence we ought to have in our Saviours Promiſes, and cares of his Providence; Thirdly, by an exact Knowledg of the Hiſtory of all Ages.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41961:34"/> Now this laſt means being above the Capacity of moſt People, is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. It is enough to a well meaning Perſon, that he ſees in Scripture what he ought to believe, touching the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> and thereupon charitably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes, that the Fathers have not deviated from this Faith into Capital Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. It ſufficeth him to believe that our Saviour's Promiſes to the Church, that he would never forſake it, have had their accompliſhment, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Clouds have fallen on the Miniſtration of it, by the mixture of mens Devices with Gods everlaſting Truths, yet has our Saviour taken care to preſerve the Faithful, and execute the Decree of his Election. So that ſuch a one has no need to perplex himſelf with Hiſtory, nor with reading over of three or four hundred Volums, which will not yield him the leaſt Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, much leſs need he entangle himſelf in the Author of the <hi>Perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>'s Method, which is a fourth way the World hath yet never been acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with. When ſuch a Perſon hears of Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book, and the account he gives of the Change which hath hapned, I doubt not but he is glad to hear that even by this way, which is only proper to the Learned, the Truth he believes has bin illuſtrated, neither do I doubt but he believes with a humane Faith, what is told him concerning it; but we muſt not imagine that his Belief touching the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> hath changed its Foundation, and left its Relyance on the Word of God, for it remaineth ſtill where it was; ſo that when he ſhould be queſtioned concerning the ſolidity of Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Proofs, or that of any other Miniſter, relating to this Subject, he will not be troubled about it, nor farther concern himſelf in theſe Debates, for he knows his Incapacity. He will content himſelf with a favourable Opinion of the Fathers, and with his Confidence in God, leaving theſe Debates to thoſe that have Skill to manage them.</p>
                        <p>NOW as to ſuch as contemn Mr. <hi>Aubertins</hi> Book, I know none in our Communion of that number, and perhaps in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> there will be found as few of that Mind, if we except Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> and his Friends, who have given their Judgments about it, after a very ſlighting and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory manner. But I ſhall not take any farther Notice of this here, but continue my Obſervations. I do affirm then, I never yet had the Luck to meet with this wretched <hi>Calviniſt</hi> whom he has deſcribed in ſuch pittiful Strains. I was never yet told, <hi>That the Scripture fills the Mind with Doubts,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 1. C. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>which it doth not reſolve, and that ſuch a Perſon finds the Writings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Obſcure, and that the Divines of either Party could not ſatisfy him, and there was nothing but the Arguments of the</hi> Perpetuity <hi>which could win his Heart.</hi> Is not this ſuch a Model of <hi>Calviniſm</hi> as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> deſires, drawn from an Idea of his own Conceiving, and offered to them who would hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward be of the number of its Proſelytes. But what likelyhood is there that any man to become Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> or the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyte, would Sacrifice the Scriptures, Fathers, and Divines of both parties to them. What Probability I ſay is there that their Pretention ſhould ſo far prevail upon any man? Howſoever it be, it's an idle Fancy to imagine that a Perſon who is really of our Communion can fall into this Condition, and thereupon take up a Reſolution of changing his Belief; and the Proof which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> gives us is entirely faulty, for it can at fartheſt but conclude an Uncertainty, touching the <hi>Fathers,</hi> but not at all as it relates to the Word of God, from which a good man will never depart, even when he ſhall fall into Doubts touching the Opinions of the <hi>Fathers.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT let us ſee who theſe Perſons are, who are repreſented to us float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41961:35"/> on Doubts and Scruples. They are two ſorts of Perſon, <hi>the moſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miniſters on one hand, and all the unlearned</hi> Calviniſts <hi>on the other.</hi> It is <note place="margin">Lib. 1. C. 5. P. 36.</note> moſt <hi>Falſe,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Arnaud, that the moſt able Miniſters are perſwaded the</hi> Fathers <hi>are manifeſtly for them.</hi> To which he addeth, <hi>that</hi> all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of mean Capacities, who are not able to make this Search, are raſh in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving it, and cannot be perſwaded of it but by a fond Humor. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of theſe Points is grounded on ſlight Proofs. Obſerve here the firſt of them. <hi>Lewis Lavater</hi> relates that <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> began to doubt of the Truth of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> in reading St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> Works; that he was ſtrengthened in his Doubtings by reading of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts; that he immediately rejects his firſt Thoughts, by conſidering theſe Doctrines were generally entertained; yet being willing to overcome this weakneſs of Mind, he applyed himſelf to the reading of the Fathers; but could not be fully ſatisfied by them, becauſe he oftentimes met in their Writings, with the Expreſſions of the Body and Blood of Chriſt in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Whereupon at length rejecting the Authority of men, he wholly applied himſelf to the Word of God, and then the Truth appeared more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto him. This Teſtimony concludes nothing unleſs it be this, that it is not eaſy for a man that has imbibed the Principles of the Romiſh Church from his Infancy, to diſcover immediately the Truth, ſeeing that <hi>Oecolam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padius</hi> who perceived the firſt Beams of it ſhining in St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> Works, and afterwards received deeper Impreſſions by reading of the Holy Scriptures, was puzled by reading the <hi>Fathers,</hi> till ſuch time as he wholly applyed himſelf to the ſtudying of the Word of God, by which he was put out of Doubt, and afterwards came more eaſily to the Knowledg of the real Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> whoſe Writings from that time he vehemently urged againſt all oppoſers of the Truth. This ſhews us the ſtrength of Prejudice, and how neceſſary it is for the Underſtanding of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> to become firſt well exerciſed in the Holy Scriptures.</p>
                        <p>AS to the <hi>Centuriators</hi> of <hi>Magdebourg,</hi> it is known they held the <hi>Ausbouyg</hi> Confeſſion, and taught the Doctrine of the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> and conſequently are not competent Judges in this Controverſy. For they have bin greatly concerned to have the <hi>Fathers</hi> on their ſide, ſome of them chooſing rather to impoſe the Sence of Tranſubſtanciation on the indefinite general Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which import that the Bread is made the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, or that it is changed into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, rather than to underſtand them in a myſtical Sence, which would overthrow their Doctrine. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it be, they are not of the number of our Miniſters, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ought not to ſtray thus beyond the Bounds of this Controverſy.</p>
                        <p>THAT Paſſage of <hi>Scaligers</hi> which he urgeth againſt us, is taken out of one of the moſt impertinent Books as ever was written, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> hath more Leaſure than he pretends, ſeeing he ſets himſelf upon inquiring after ſuch kind of Proofs. This Book being a Collection of what <hi>Scaliger</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have diſcourſed in a familiar Colloquy, which is ſtuffed with all manners of Fooleries, and Abſurdities. For the School Boyes, from whoſe Memoirs theſe Exercitations were committed to the Preſs, have inſerted whatſoever came into their Heads, after a childiſh and inconſiderate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which ſhews us they had not yet arrived to years of Diſcretion. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> informs us himſelf that one of theſe Youths who helpt to make this Rhapſody, turned Roman Catholick, which might well tranſport him by a Zeal common to young Converts, to make his Maſter ſpeak a

                        <p>
                           <hi>WITEMBOGARD</hi> was one of the chief of the <hi>Arminian</hi> Party, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed againſt the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters, neither is he a Witneſs to be fully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in what he tells us concerning <hi>Caſaubon;</hi> yet if what <hi>Spondanus</hi> has written of <hi>Caſaubon;</hi> be true, we muſt acknowledge that this Perſon, who altho otherwiſe was extraordinarily learned, did not excel in Judgment. <hi>He was a man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of a fickle Mind,</hi> and ever wavering in maters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <note place="margin">Annals Eccl. ad An. 1600, art. 12.</note> he was willing to pleaſe both Parties, and by that means pleaſed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is very likely that near Familiarity he had with <hi>Cardinal Perron,</hi> drew him into this ambiguos Humour, which ought not to be made uſe of againſt us, much leſs to be propoſed as an Example for the regulating of our Conduct. And beſides he may more juſtly be ſaid to be <hi>Critick</hi> than a Miniſter.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall not here trouble my ſelf with what is alleaged concerning <hi>Socinus</hi> and his Followers; for there is a great deal of Paſſion and Injuſtice ſhewed, in Confronting them with us, ſeeing the Point here in Queſtion is what our moſt knowing Miniſters hold about this matter; I confeſs the <hi>Socinians</hi> reject <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> but it is moreover ſo much their intereſt to decry the Doctrine of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> that 'tis no marvel if they ſpeak ſo unjuſtly of them. They have built on the antient Hereſies of <hi>Photinus, Macedonius,</hi> and <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and ſeeing themſelves oppoſed by Councils, and by the writings of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> this hath moved them not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have no reſpect for them; but likewiſe to lay to their charge things which they never believed; to the end they might render them odious, and marr their Credit. So that Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> impoſes on us (when he tells us) <hi>that the</hi> Socinians <hi>have no intereſt in acknowledging that the Writings of the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 1. C. 5. Pag. 41.</note> Fathers <hi>favour the Catholicks, and that it would have bin more to their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to deny this.</hi> The contrary of which is apparent.</p>
                        <p>WHEN he ſhould produce ſome of our Miniſters who doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Writings of the <hi>Fathers</hi> favour us in the point of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> or who even believed they were againſt us, ſhould this appear ſo ſtrange to us? It is not an eaſy matter for a man to diſentangle himſelf out of all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt paſſages which are faſly attributed to the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and ſet forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Names, and from all the Artifices made uſe of to diſguiſe their Doctrines. I have written a Chapter on purpoſe in my Anſwer to Father <hi>Noiiet,</hi> wherein I produce ſeveral Examples of this, which the Readers may peruſe at their Leaſure. Even <hi>Caſaubon</hi> himſelf whom I now mentioned, is one of them who hath fallen into this Snare, for he hath taken two <hi>prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory Prayers for the Maſs,</hi> to be the true and undoubted Works of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> altho that in effect, they are compoſed by <hi>Anſelme</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury.</hi> Now if any Perſon has bin deceived like <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> and doubted whither the <hi>Fathers</hi> were for us, muſt this be uſed as a Proof againſt us, ought ſuch a ones Miſtakes to be the Rule of our Thoghts, this certainly is contrary to reaſon.</p>
                        <p>BUT for one Miniſter or two whom Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> can bring againſt us, we can produce a great number who have not heſitated in this matter. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> himſelf, who lived in a time when theſe Fopperies were ſcarely diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, yet aſſerts that the <hi>Fathers have retained the pious and orthodox Sence
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41961:36"/> of this Myſtery,</hi> and affirms, <hi>that not having found them at all to derogate</hi>

                           <hi>from the only Sacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt, he could not therefore conſent to the charging of them with Impiety, altho he doth not think them wholly excuſable in the form of the Action.</hi> To <hi>Calvin</hi> we may add <hi>Cook</hi> (who was Tutour to King <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and ſuppoſed to be Author of a Book intit'led <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allacticon;) Thomas Crammer</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> Bp. <hi>Jewel, Peter Martyr;</hi> the Author of the Orthodox Treatiſe; <hi>Andrew Volan,</hi> the Divines of the Univerſity of <hi>Heydelberg; Du Moulin, Chamier, Rivet, Faucheur, Meſtreſat,</hi> and <hi>Blondel;</hi> not to mention <hi>Du Pleſſis,</hi> and Mr. <hi>De Saumaiſe,</hi> nor ſeveral others who have written on this Subject, by the Teſtimony of the <hi>Fathers;</hi> which ſheweth with how great precipitation Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> hath aſſerted: <hi>that it is moſt falſe, the moſt knowing Miniſters are perſwaded the</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>are manifeſtly for them, and the Solutions they give their Paſſages are good and Solid.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>WHAT he mentions concerning Mr. <hi>Daillé,</hi> is taken in a contrary Sence; for he never deſigned to deny the Advantage we have in the <hi>Fathers</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> nor leave it to be queſtioned. His Book againſt Mr. <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Cottiby</hi> is an authentick Proof of this, and being as yet thro Gods Grace, in a Capacity to declare his own Thoughts, there needs no more but to ask his opinion touching this Point, and ſee what Anſwer he will make. There will appear no Difference betwixt his Opinion and mine, provided his Words are underſtood as he meant them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Daillé</hi> ſais, <hi>'tis a hard matter to gather from the Writings of the</hi> Fathers, <note place="margin">
                              <hi>De uſu Pat. C.</hi> 2</note> 
                           <hi>their Opinions touching thoſe Articles in Religion, about which we differ, becauſe the matters they treat of are for the moſt part very remote.</hi> His meaning is that it is a hard matter to find a formal and expreſs Declaration of their Sence in theſe matters; which ſhould be declared in ſuch Terms as theſe, <hi>I deny, or affirm, I approve, or condemn, I reject, or receive;</hi> and the Reaſon he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leages do's ſufficiently confirm this: for he ſaies, <hi>That the Matters they treat of are remote from our Controverſies, and that they thought not of us when they wrote.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>MY Sence differs not from his, and therefore I ſhall not fear to ſay with <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> him, <hi>that they that expect to find the Belief of the</hi> Fathers <hi>clearly ſet down in their Writings, are generally miſtaken, even as he who thinks to meet with the Affections and Deſires of his Mind amongſt the ſound of Bells.</hi> And indeed, if we expect to find a poſitive and preciſe Rejection of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctrine in the Writings of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> like unto that which is at this day amongſt us, we ſhall be much miſtaken, and the Reaſon is apparent, in as much as the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> being not extant in the time of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> they have not expreſly condemned it, for men are not wont to condemn O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions before they appear. Yet do's not this hinder but that the <hi>Fathers</hi> are againſt <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> by way of Negation, that is to ſay by their Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, becauſe they never inſerted it amongſt the Articles of their Faith, they never propounded it to their Hearers, nor unfolded the Myſteries of it, nor defended its Conſequences, as doth the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as they had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion done, had they believed it. And this is what I ſay; and Mr. <hi>Daillé</hi> dos not gainſay it; but on the contrary a few lines after what Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> has recited, he lays down this general Propoſition: <hi>That the ſilence of the</hi> Fathers <hi>on the controverted Points which they ſo much value, is of ſome weight, and amounts perhaps to a clear Proof; but ſurely not in favour of them</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
                           <pb n="41" facs="tcp:41961:36"/> 
                           <hi>who hold the Affirmative.</hi> So far Mr. <hi>Daillé</hi> and I ſpeak preciſely the ſame language. But I affirm likewiſe, that beſides the ſilence of the <hi>Fathers</hi> there is to be found ſeveral things in their Writings; inconſiſtent with the Belief of <hi>Tranſubstantiation,</hi> and the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> and I hold this Proof doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently conclude they did not believe theſe Doctrines; Mr. <hi>Daillé</hi> ſpeaking in general of this <hi>Order</hi> of Proofs, ſaith, <hi>he freely confeſſeth that every wiſe mans Faith is as a Body, whoſe parts have a dependance on each other. So that we</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                           <hi>may know by the things he expreſſeth, what he thinks of thoſe which he expreſſeth not, whether he doth believe them or not, it being unlikely he would admit what doth evidently oppoſe his Opinions, or reject their neceſſary Conſequences,</hi> to which he addeth, <hi>that he does acknowledg that this way of handling the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the</hi> Fathers <hi>would be moſt profitable, and more proper to dive into their bottom, than any other, provided we ſuppoſe two things, the one, that the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the antient Doctors is all of a Piece, and does no way contradict it ſelf, and the other, that he who would judge after this manner, muſt have a piercing Wit, a good Memory, and a Judgment free from Prejudice.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>AS to the firſt of theſe Suppoſitions, he ſaith, that it is not abſolutely out of doubt; and as to the other, that all theſe Qualities do ſeldom meet in one man. What he ſaies is true, in this general Conſideration. But this does not hinder me from adding, that in the particular caſe of <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,</hi> and the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> the firſt ſuppoſition is out of doubt; and the ſecond is not abſolutely neceſſary. To make this apparent, we need but conſider, on one hand the rank theſe Doctrines hold in a Church which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves them, and on the other, the number and nature of thoſe things which oppoſe them in the Writings of the antient <hi>Fathers.</hi> The Example of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhews us, that they that believe them, reſpect them as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable Myſteries which muſt not be called in queſtion, and ſuch as are of greateſt Importance in Religion, and which muſt be defended againſt the Contradiction of Senſe and Reaſon, and for which we ought to be armed with the greateſt Caution; as being in ſhort, Myſteries which are daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented us, in their Celebration and Participation of them, which ſhould be diſtinctly known by all the Faithful, and cleerly and plainly taught the People, to the end every one may know that what he receiveth is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Subſtance of his Saviour, and give him the Worſhip due to a Creator. Whence it follows, that if the antient Church believed theſe things, it has believed them in this Degree, and that 'tis not poſſible but the <hi>Fathers</hi> in general would take ſuch care as not to maintain things which overthrow them, or reject others which are the neceſſary Conſequences of them. It is not poſſible I ſay, that they ſhould all of 'em be thus inconſiderate as to aſſert ſeveral things which may juſtly ſcandalize their Followers and that in ſo tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and well known a Point, as is that of the Subſtance of Jeſus Chriſt, which they every day received. On the other hand, if we conſider the Nature and Number of things to be met with in the Writings of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> contrary to <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> we ſhall obſerve they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them by a primary, immediate and evident contrariety, for which there is no need of a ſharp Wit, nor great Memory, but a ſound underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and diſintereſſed Judgment: we ſhall find that theſe things are in great Number, and as well prevail over a mans Mind by their Multitude, as their Quality. And this Mr. <hi>Daillé</hi> has not denyed, ſo that as I do not thwart his Rule, ſo he does not oppoſe my Exception, therefore there is no Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction betwixt us.</p>
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:41961:37"/>
                        <p>BUT Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will reply, Mr. <hi>Daillé</hi> do's oppoſe our Exception, for he applies his Rule to the Subject of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> acknowledging <hi>that as there are Paſſages in the</hi> Fathers <hi>Writings, which ſeem to be inexplicable, in</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">C. 1.</note> 
                           <hi>the Church of</hi> Romes <hi>Sence, ſo there are likewiſe ſome which can in no wiſe admit the Sence of the</hi> Proteſtants, <hi>as them which expreſly import that the Bread chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es its Nature, that by the Almighty Power of God it becometh the Fleſh of the Word: and ſuch like. If Cardinal</hi> Perron, <hi>ſaith he, and other ſublime Wits on both ſides, proteſt they find no Difficulty, we muſt acknowledg they ſaid it only out of a Bravadoe, turning the beſt ſide outwards, or elſe that the reſt of the World are very dim ſighted to perceive nothing but Darkneſs, where theſe People behold nothing but Light.</hi> And elſewhere, taking notice of ſome Paſſages (which ſeem to deny the Conſubſtantiality of the Son, determined in the Council of <hi>Nice,)</hi> which are to be met with in the Writings of the <hi>Fathers</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded that Council. <hi>Let the</hi> Fathers, addeth he, <hi>affirm or deny that the</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt <hi>is really the Body of Chriſt, they will not for all this contradict thy Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, whoſoever thou art, whether Romaniſt or Proteſtant, more ſtrongly than the Fathers of</hi> Antioch <hi>did in appearance contradict them of</hi> Nice. <hi>To which we may now add, that as the</hi> Arians <hi>had no reaſon to draw to their Opinion, and alleage, as deciſive parts of their Queſtion, ſuch tranſient Diſcourſes as were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently meant by the antient</hi> Fathers, <hi>without any Deſign of treating on this: ſo likewiſe we have no cauſe, neither thou I ſay nor I, to alleage as Sentences pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in our caſe, which has bin ſtated but of late, the ſayings of the</hi> Fathers, <hi>which were written by them on other matters, ſeveral Ages before our Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies began, concerning which they have expreſſed themſelves very differently and obſcurely, and even ſometimes in appearance contradictorily.</hi> Having ſhewn af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards that the <hi>Fathers</hi> deſigned to be obſcure in their Diſcourſes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> to hide this Myſtery from the Catecumeniſts.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>SEEING then,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that in this and other Matters, they deſigned to conceal their Thoughts, we muſt not therefore wonder, if their Expreſſions have bin oftentimes obſcure, and that which commonly is an effect of Obſcurity, if they ſeem ſometime to differ and contradict one another.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I anſwer that this being well underſtood, doth not at all obſtruct my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, nor what I ſaid in my Anſwer to the <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> Mr. <hi>Daillé</hi> ſpeaks of the particular Judgment which we may make of ſome Paſſages of the Fathers produced by both Parties; and I ſpeak of the general Judgment which ought to be made on the whole Body of our Proofs, and Difficulties brought againſt them; and as to what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> alleageth concerning my Anſwer, wherein I ſpeak <hi>touching the Sence which People Aſſiſted by the light of</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Anſwer to the Perpetuity P. 192.</note> 
                           <hi>Scripture, ſtrength of Reaſon, and plain Inſtructions of their Miniſters, may give to the myſtical Expreſſions, which were then in uſe.</hi> Theſe are things wholly different. I do not deny but that there are ſeveral difficult Places in the Writings of the <hi>Fathers.</hi> Some of which Mr. <hi>Daillé</hi> has taken Notice of. He needed not be brought in queſtion for this, ſeeing I plainly delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my Mind touching this matter, in the beginning of my Anſwer. <hi>I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that the way of ſeeking the Truth touching the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>by the Doctrine</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Anſwer to the Prpetuity P. 34.</note> 
                           <hi>of the</hi> Fathers, <hi>is in it ſelf a way which is indirect, prepoſterous, and very tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, wherein we have great cauſe to fear Miſtakes and Wandrings.</hi> Theſe are my Words, and Mr. <hi>Daillé</hi> has ſaid no more, and I do ſtill affirm, that if a man examines theſe Paſſages apart, and proteſts he finds no obſcurity in them, we cannot but take theſe his Proteſtations for <hi>Bravadoes.</hi> But this does not hinder
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41961:37"/> but that the general Judgment we ought to make of the Belief of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> touching the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and which reſulteth from an exact conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Proofs relating both to one ſide and the other, is undoubtedly on our ſide, whether theſe particular Paſſages, which ſeem at firſt to be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, are illuſtrated by others which ſhew the real Sence of them, or when their Difficulty ſhould remain, it is overcome by the Number and Evidence of the contrary Proofs. The Conſiderations which Mr. <hi>Daillé</hi> makes on theſe difficult Places, do in themſelves contribute to the Eſtabliſhment of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of this general Judgment, which I mentioned: for they diſcover to us the Cauſes of this Obſcurity, they give us the like Examples in other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and by this means leſſen the Offence which may be taken at them, and ſatisfy a mans Mind.</p>
                        <p>BUT he ſaith, <hi>that neither the Romaniſts, nor the Proteſtants have any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>

But this hinders not but we may ſtill conclude, they held not <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> becauſe that if they had held theſe Doctrines, they would not have expreſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as they do. Neither doth this deprive us of the Liberty of proceeding by way of Negation, which is to conclude by their Silence in theſe Doctrines, that they held them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Neither does this moreover hinder, but that after a due Conſideration of all theſe affirmative and negative Proofs, we may make a certain and deciſive Judgment on the Queſtion touching the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the antient Church in our own Favour.

This I do not deny, but on the contrary do ever affirm, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture is the only certain Rule, and our having recourſe to the <hi>Fathers</hi> is but by way of Condeſcenſion.

For there being, as I already ſaid, two Queſtions before us, the one, touching what we are to believe concerning the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and the other concerning what has bin believed by the antient Church, the firſt of theſe, which is that of <hi>Right,</hi> reſpects in general all them of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; but the ſecond, for as much as it may be decided by Hiſtory, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpects them amongſt us, who have ſufficient Leaſure and Curioſity to inform themſelves. So that the Prolixity, Difficulty, and intricacy which we meet with in the Writings of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> do ſufficiently evidence that their Books are very improper for the Deciſion of the firſt of theſe Queſtions, whereon depends that of our Controverſies, ſeeing theſe Difficulties will be inſuperable to the greateſt part amongſt us; altho they will not render them unfit to decide the ſecond, becauſe they are not inſuperable to them who would apply themſelves thereunto as they ought, to ſatisfy their Curioſity, neither will they hinder them in ſhort from making a moſt certain Judgment in our Favour. If then the Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> be only offered to them to whom the firſt Queſtion belongs, they will anſwer they have no need of it, being ſatisfied with the Word of God; and if they be demanded what they believe touching the antient Church, they will anſwer, that they judge of it according to the Rules of Chriſtian Charity, and our Saviours Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. But if we proeeed farther, and ſuppoſe it be enquired of them, how it has come to paſs that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has altered the antient Doctrine; they will anſwer, their Salvation depends not on this Knowledg, but that it muſt needs be, it has made an Alteration; ſeeing it believes at this day what it ought not to believe, and which without doubt hath not bin believed heretofore, as they judge out of Charity to the Antients. Should they be urged to tell how this has hapned, they will anſwer again, this is not an account wherein their Salvation is concerned, and that this Queſtion ought to be propoſed to thoſe Perſons who know it, and in all this they will have Reaſon. If this Treatiſe be offered to thoſe of the ſecond Rank, that is to ſay to them who are learned, and have had the Curioſity of informing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to whom properly the ſecond Queſtion belongs; they will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe anſwer, they have no need of this Method, having already informed themſelves by a natural and direct way, which is of more value than all theſe Conjectures, or if they have not done it, they will do it, being not ſo ſilly
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41961:38"/> as to ſhut their Eyes, and reject the Evidence of their Senſes, to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a Method wherein there can be nothing but Confuſion to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and theſe laſt will have Reaſon too.</p>
                        <p>BUT ſaith Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> we muſt ſuppoſe that the Proofs of the Treatiſe are evident, for they cannot be ſuppoſed falſe, till ſuch time as they are exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. You ought then to have begun here, wherefore your Exceptions ſignify nothing. I anſwer that theſe Suppoſitions are not juſter than his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. For if theſe curious Perſons whom I mentioned, have already taken the Pains they ought, whereby to aſcertain themſelves in the Proofs of Fact, they will be prepared to judge, that the Arguments of the Treatiſe are falſe and captious, becauſe that moral Impoſſibilities, ſuch as theſe are, and in ſuch a Subject as this, cannot ſubſiſt againſt Proofs of Fact, which are immediate, certain, and evident as ours are. If they have not yet taken this Pains, I ſay that without examining whether the Proofs of the Treatiſe be good or bad, they will only mind the Method, and by comparing it with that of Diſcuſſion, if they are men of Reaſon, they will prefer this laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other, becauſe that 'tis in effect moſt natural in it ſelf, and more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in its Proofs.</p>
                        <p>WHAT ſhall we do then with the Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> which has made ſuch a Noiſe in the World? Will it be of no uſe? There are a crue of People in the World, who are curious and idle both together, who are willing to know the Opinions of former Ages on theſe famous Articles, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which <hi>Europe</hi> is at this day divided; but yet will be at no Pains for this, becauſe Labour is diſtaſteful to them, and they have other things to do. It is then for ſuch Perſons as theſe, this Treatiſe has bin written. For it court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, and preſents it ſelf to 'em, whether at Eaſe or in Buſineſs; it only deſires them to ſpend two Hours on its Reading, whereby to decide a Point of this Importance. The Style of it is curious and enticing, and its Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions emphatical, it winneth on the Mind, and leads it inſenſibly where it pleaſes. All this flatters mens Curioſity and Lazyneſs both together. But if this ſort of People loved their Salvation, as we may ſuppoſe they ought, we ſhould then have but two or three things to ſay to them. Firſt, that they beware of theſe ſhort Methods, which favour at the ſame time two Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which ſeldom agree, I mean Idleneſs and Curioſity. For we cannot arrive at any certainty in theſe kind of Queſtions, if we do not earneſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our ſelves to them, for Labour and Knowledg do always go together, and it commonly happens that they who thus promiſe us ſuch great Knowledg, without any trouble, do cheat us two ways, for they lead us into tedious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixities, and dreadful Difficulties, and at laſt having tired us, they leave us as wiſe as we were at firſt.</p>
                        <p>AND this is exactly the caſe of the Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> if we right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider it; for it promiſes us immediately, nothing but Perſpicuity, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilities, and Convictions, it being made up of undenyable Truths. Yet let a man take but the Pains to examine only his fixt Point, which is his firſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, on which the whole ſtreſs of his Book lies; and he will find that 'tis impoſſible to be certain in it. I mean the Year one thouſand fifty three, wherein <hi>Berengarius</hi> was at firſt condemned, and in which time the Author of the Treatiſe pretend's the univerſal Church was agreed in the Belief of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and the <hi>real Preſence.</hi> Now to be ſatisfied in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, we ſhould have an exact Knowledg of the eleventh Century, to the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41961:39"/> end we may diſcern whether this Condemnation of <hi>Berengarius</hi> was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Effect of the Churches Union, or only that of a Party, which was then the ſtrongeſt at the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> We ſhould know each particular mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this great Affair, that we may be able to judge whether humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt had no ſhare in it: whether thoſe that were concerned in it did not act againſt their Conſciences; and whether the Procedings were juſt and regular. We muſt examine the State of Princes, Eccleſiaſticks, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to be ſatisfied in this ſuppoſed Union. We ſhould have before us the Writings of <hi>Berengarius</hi> and others who held the ſame Opinions, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their Arguments and Defences. But all theſe things are impoſſible. We have no other account of this Hiſtory, than what ſome intereſſed Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have bin pleaſed to give us, and in which there are Relations juſtly ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be falſe. The ſecret Deſigns and Motives which then prevailed are out of our reach. We know ſcarcely any thing more of the Perſons who then made up the Church, but that they were the greateſt part of them bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in profound Ignorance. The Writings of <hi>Berengarins</hi> and his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are loſt, for there has bin Care taken to extinguiſh the Remembrance of them. In ſhort, this is an Abyſs wherein we behold nothing, whereby we may be able to affirm with any certainty, that the whole Church was united in the Belief of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and the <hi>real Preſence.</hi> For a man to give Credit to any Relation of <hi>Berengarius</hi>'s Adverſaries; (who bragged that their Opinion was that of the whole World,) it would be to be over Credulous, in any Affair of this Importance, and ſo much the more, becauſe the contrary appeareth by ſubſtantial Proofs, which ſhould be examined, before we reſt ſatisfied in them.</p>
                        <p>SO that here we are already ſufficiently perplexed in the firſt Particular, and ſhall be no leſs in the others. If we would be aſcertained in the Proofs of the Treatiſe, we ſhould know perfectly the Tempers of the People, their Condition and principal Circumſtances, in the Ages which preceded the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leventh Century. We ſhould know, how the Body of the Eccleſiaſticks was compoſed, what was the Humour and Temper of them who held the firſt Rank, even how far their Credit and Authority reached, what kind of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions they gave the People, and after what manner the People received them. We muſt likewiſe examine the nature of the Change we ſpeak of, by what degrees we ſuppoſe it has bin introduced, by how many ways and means it may be ſaid to be poſſible. For if all this be not diſtinctly known, how can it with any Confidence be affirmed, that this Change is impoſſible. Moreover before it can be affirmed as an undoubted Truth, that had an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation touching the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> bin attempted, the People would have riſen into Tumults, the <hi>Religious</hi> clamour'd againſt it, the Eccleſiaſticks oppoſed it, and the Councils taken notice of it, and in ſhort the Bands of an external Communion would have bin broken; how many particulars muſt be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up firſt! We ought to know what kind of Zeal People had for the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God in thoſe Days; whether the effects of this Zeal could not be hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by I know not how many things which occur in theſe different Orders of men, whom I mentioned, as Ignorance in ſome, ſimplicity and meanneſs of Spirit in others, the fear of diſturbing the publick Peace, the Favour or Hatred of Perſons, and ſeveral other humane Cauſes, which ſet men on acting or deſiſting from it. We ſhould likewiſe have a true and particular Account of the Condition of the ſchiſmatical Churches at that time, when <hi>Berengarius</hi> was condemned, which is not an eaſy matter, as will appear in the ſequel of this Diſcourſe. In a Word, to attain the ends of the Deſign
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41961:39"/> of this Treatiſe, when even its Proofs ſhould be Subſtantial and Concluſive, a man muſt be more knowing than an Angel; for unleſs we knew the Thoughts of all mankind, for the ſpace of two hundred Years together, or could raiſe the Dead to inform our ſelves by them of what they have done; and what they have not done, it is not otherwiſe poſſible to be at any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. But it will be perhaps anſwered, we muſt judge according to the Light of common Senſe, and what we ſee in our times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to which I reply, that even common Senſe ſhewes us, that there is no certainty in theſe kind of Proofs, and that the Experience of our own Age contradicts them. And when it ſhould be imagined that all theſe Difficulties are ſurmounted, I come then and trouble this Victory with my <hi>Aubertin,</hi> and Proofs of Fact, requiring, before the Queſtion be decided, that my Objection be anſwered. Now ſhould Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> pretend my Objection is groundleſs, and that I ſhould be ſilenced in being told, that theſe Proofs have bin conſidered, and their pretended Clearneſs appears only to them, who ſuffer themſelves to be tranſported by the <hi>Enthuthiaſms</hi> of my <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> I ſhall make him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that I ſpeak here only of curious and lazy People, to whom the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> is offered as a ſhort Method<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to eaſe them of the lengths of a way of Diſcuſſion: which ſort of Perſons cannot ſay they know all our Proofs.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall tell him moreover, that the reading of my Book, has not yet ſo far tranſported People with Enthuſiaſtical Raptures, as the reading of his has done to his immortal Praiſe. For there are Latin Verſes under this very Title of <hi>Enthuſiaſms,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Arnauds</hi> Friends its ſeems have not bin aſhamed to print, in which there appears all the lively Characters of a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etical Fury. For they ſpeak of his Book, as of the <hi>Sun,</hi> which contains in it ſelf a great meaſure of the Divine Light: His Lines are called <hi>new Darts of the Sacred</hi> Cupid; and his whole Book is ſaid to be full of God. <hi>Puro Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, mi Libelle, Plenus.</hi> It is compared to our Saviour himſelf, when he came down from Heaven; and is ſaid to have done the ſame Miracles; there is one of its Readers introduced, who being filled with its Divinity, cries out, <hi>Numen ecce Numen, ibi Numen.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is termed, <hi>Vir ſacro &amp; numinis entheatus oeſtro,</hi> and his Wit, <hi>Mentis vigor entheus,</hi> and again he is ſet forth to us as an <hi>Hercules</hi> armed with Coeleſtial Weapons, trampling all things under his Feet, conquering the Conquerours themſelves, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing over the Triumphers. In ſhort, <hi>France</hi> is congratulated upon the Glory it receives. <hi>Tanto prodigio ſuperba fulge, felix prodigio futura tanto.</hi> All which conſidered, has not Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> pertinently mentioned Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſms? Certainly never the Tripos of <hi>Delphos,</hi> nor the Grove of the Sibyl <hi>Cumeé,</hi> inſpired ſuch like Ravings.</p>
                        <p>BUT to return to the matter in hand. Is it not poſſible will ſome ſay, to be aſcertained of the matter in Queſtion, by ſome way leſs tedious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate, than the examination of ſuch a great Volum as Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book? Yea without doubt; for, to know as much as is neceſſary, to the ſatisfying of a mans Mind, he need but judge according to the inſtincts of Charity, and the Confidence he ought to have in our Saviours Promiſes. Now if a man keeps to theſe Principles, he will draw a Concluſion as ſatisfactory as can be deſired. The Promiſes of our Saviour aſſure us that his Spirit ſhall be with the Faithful to the end of the World; and Chriſtian Charity obliges us to believe that the <hi>Fathers</hi> are of this Number. From whence I conclude; that there has ever bin a conſiderable number of true Chriſtians, whoſe Faith
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41961:40"/> has not bin corrupted by damnable Errors. This is a ſure Concluſion, and ſufficient to ſatisfy my Mind. I conclude likewiſe, that the <hi>Fathers</hi> have bin of this Number, this is a Judgment of Charity, and is ſufficient to acquit me of my Duty. Should it be told me, if I proceed farther, it would be to give my ſelf a great deal of Trouble, <hi>viz.</hi> to Read, Study, and Meditate, to compare the Proofs of both Parties, and if this offends me, I can complain of no body but my ſelf, that is to ſay of my own Lazyneſs or Curioſity.</p>
                        <p>IT is then neither juſt nor neceſſary to require any other abridged Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, than thoſe which I now obſerved. Yet it muſt not be thought but that there may be ſuch offered, it being no difficult matter. For 'tis but loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the Body of the Diſpute, one of thoſe captious Arguments, which ſeem to decide the whole Controverſy by the Deciſion of one only Point. Which the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> has done, for he has ſingled out <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmins</hi> Argument of the Impoſſibility of a Change, and propoſed it with greater Enlargments, tho with leſs Force than he, and this is all the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this great Method of Preſcription. So that this is not ſuch a famous Undertaking; ſeeing every little Sophiſter could do as much. Take the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the ſilence of the <hi>Fathers</hi> on <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and the <hi>real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;</hi> inſiſt largely thereon, write a Treatiſe on it; and here's then an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged Method. Take the Argument of the certainty of our Senſes; ſhew that the <hi>Fathers</hi> ſuppoſed it as an inviolable Principle of the Chriſtian <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi> ſhew the Abſurdities which would follow, had they believed that what we ſee in the Sacrament is not real Bread; here is then another Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Preſcription. Take likewiſe if you will, the Argument of the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Heathens, and accommodate it to the Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity;</hi> and you will make another Method. It is the ſame with the Argument of the Accidents without a Subject, in reſpect of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> and of that of the Adoration of the Sacrament; and almoſt of all others.</p>
                        <p>TO ſpeak my Sence of theſe Arguments reduced into Methods, I think they muſt be conſidered either abſolutely, or in relation to ſome Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. If we conſider them abſolutely; we muſt not reject them, for this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reaſon that they are called Methods of Preſcription. A rational Man will accept of them in a Controverſy, as Arguments, he will weigh their Force; but whatſoever Strength they may have, he will not forme his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by them alone, becauſe perhaps there may be on the other ſide things more conſiderable. What is there, for Example, of greater Force than the Argument taken from the Silence of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> touching the Exiſtence of Accidents without a Subject? Yet is it certain that this Argument alone muſt not determine a Man; for ſhould it be demonſtrated that the <hi>Fathers</hi> expreſly taught the Adoration of the Sacrament, and Converſion of the Subſtance, with all the other Conſequences of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> excepting this Exiſtence of the Accidents without a Subject, our Argument would not be ſtrong enough to invalidate theſe contrary Proofs. They muſt then be ranked in the order of the Controverſy, to the end they may be conſidered in a deciſive Judgment.</p>
                        <p>THERE is not, to ſpeak properly, but one particular caſe wherein we ought to be determined by a Method of Preſcription, which is when God does or does not declare his Will in Points of Religion; for what is there in the World that can excel, or equal the Validity of his Teſtimony or Silence. In matters of Religion, 'tis the Word of God which determines us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41961:40"/> poſitively ſuch and ſuch Points, and 'tis its Silence which determines us to reject others. Our Faith imitates the Wiſe Men of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Star that conducts it, (which is the Heavenly Revelation) and ſtops where this Star ſettleth, as knowing 'twould be to wander, to go farther. This then is the only true Method of Preſcription in Queſtions of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                        <p>BUT ſuppoſing the Argument was taken from the Evidence of all the Senſes, and in the Circumſtances which make this Teſtimony Valid and Infallible, may we not determine our ſelves, without proceeding any farther? I anſwer that to ſpeak abſolutely, the Senſes may be deceived, even with all the Circumſtances which render their Teſtimony allowable, for the Devil may impoſe upon them by his Illuſions; yet becauſe a judicious man muſt judge of things, not out of regard to theſe extraordinary and rare Caſes, but according to rule and common uſe, it is certain, that ſuch an Argument muſt decide the Queſtion of Fact.</p>
                        <p>THE ſame may be required touching thoſe Arguments which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Philoſophy, by the name of Demonſtrations. If a Method was ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a Proof of this Force, would it not wholly decide the Queſtion? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer there are few Demonſtrations, ſo evident and certain, that nothing can be oppoſed againſt them. Yet were there one offered which convinced the Mind, by an immediate and uncontroulable Evidence, (as thoſe which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt an apparent Contradiction, and a formal Incompatibility in the Terms; or thoſe which are eſtabliſhed on a neceſſary and inviolable Dependance, and which cannot be hind'red, or which ſuppoſe one only Cauſe, without which 'tis not poſſible that a thing ſhould exiſt; or laſtly, ſuch as are grounded on an indiſſolvible connexion of two Subjects which cannot be one without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;) I confeſs we ought then to yield; as when 'tis ſaid, the Sun is riſen, it is then day, or it is day, the Sun then is riſen; there is a Son, there muſt then be a Father; I ſay, we cannot but acquieſce in theſe kind of Arguments. But becauſe in things about which we diſpute, theſe ſort of primary and immediate Demonſtrations are very rare, a judicious Perſon will not ſuffer himſelf to be ſurprized with every thing which bears the Name of Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, or that has the Colour and appearance of it, and eſpecially when it relates to a matter belonging to another Light than that of Reaſon, as are the Objects of Senſe, and thoſe of Faith: he muſt then ſuſpend his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and reduce his pretended Demonſtrations into the Order of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, to be compared with the contrary Proofs, to the end he may make a right Judgment.</p>
                        <p>AND this is what may be ſaid in general of theſe abridged Methods. In their Circumſtances, they are to be conſidered, either as relating to the Perſons they are offered, or to the Queſtion which they decide, or the Rank which they hold, and according to the quality of their Proofs. If they be offered to Perſons to whom the Queſtion doth not belong, it is in their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er abſolutely to reject them, in alleaging, that this concerns not them, and they cannot juſtly be blamed when they ſhould do thus. Should they be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to Perſons intereſſed in the Queſtion, or who would take part in it, they ought ordinarily to proceed according to the Rules I have laid down, and eſpecially if the Queſtion which they decide is of that importance, as that it ought not to be ſlightly handled. But if we do ſuppoſe on one hand, that the Order of theſe Methods is indirect and unnatural, and that their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41961:41"/> are not taken but from Probabilities, and on the other, that we may be informed by a more natural Courſe, and a more certain and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Means. I ſay, that a wiſe Man ought to prefer this laſt way before the other, altho it be more tedious and difficult, for tho he cannot anſwer theſe Arguments, yet this does not argue he muſt be determined by them; for it will be time enough to conſider them, when after a due Examination of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that may be alleaged on both ſides, he ſhall make his deciſive Judgment. In fine, I ſay, that if we ſuppoſe a man already aſcertained in the Queſtion, by an orderly way, by numerous and concluſive Proofs, and by a Knowledg humanely Certain, and Infallible, as is that of his Eyes and common Senſes on their proper Objects, he cannot reaſonably be deſired to change his Opinion by an indirect Method, which is from hence ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be artificial and deceitful, in that the Proofs which it offers can amount to no more than Probabilities. If he be wiſe, he will keep to his firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, and reject this Method as uſeleſs, without troubling himſelf with a particular Examination of it, unleſs to give himſelf the greater Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he determines to diſcover the falſity of it.</p>
                        <p>WE ſee already what uſe muſt be made of the Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity,</hi> together with all its long train of Arguments and Suppoſitions, which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has made in its Favour. For firſt, there is little Sincerity in the Objection he ſtated in the beginning, in which he doth not explain our real Pretenſion. Secondly, He paſſeth over in Silence, amongſt the Number which he makes of the Perſons of our Communion, ſeveral who trouble not themſelves with the Diſpute touching the Queſtion of matter of Fact, that is to ſay touching the Belief of the antient Church, and in relation to theſe, who are the greateſt number, we may already affirm that the Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> is of no uſe. Thirdly, He has very ill proved that the moſt knowing Miniſters do doubt whether the <hi>Fathers</hi> are for us, whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that not being able to finde his Proſelytes, neither amongſt the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                              <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                           </gap>k of the Illiterate People, nor amongſt that of the Learned, it is to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he will find them no where. Fourthly, He hath bin ſhewed, that when it ſhould be granted, there were Miniſters, who doubted whether the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> were for us; yet would it not follow, that they would leave the Word of God, on which alone their Faith depends, to yield themſelves up to the Arguments of the <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> Fifthly, He hath bin ſhewed that when one or two ſhould be of this Opinion, yet could they not carry it away from all the reſt who have bin, or are of a contrary Mind: whence it follows, that if the leaſt judicious among us regulate their Opinions on this Point by that of the moſt knowing, they will 'tis probable range themſelves on the ſide of the greateſt Number, rather than on that wherein there is but one or two; ſo that here is almoſt all of 'em eſcaped the <hi>Treatiſes</hi> Conqueſt. Sixthly, It has bin likewiſe ſhewed him that the Prolixity and Difficulties to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in the common way, which is that of <hi>Diſcuſſion,</hi> yield no advantage to the <hi>Treatiſe</hi> to make it received under the Title of an abridged Method. Seventhly, He has bin moreover ſhewed the inſuperable Perplexities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Method engages People: So that thoſe who are moſt in Love with ſhort Ways, and new Faſhions, cannot but be diſguſted at this. Eightly, It has bin demonſtrated, that Perſons who were never informed of the real Doctrine of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and would willingly be aſcertain'd of it, ought in all Reaſon to prefer a Method of Diſcuſſion, whatſoever tediouſneſs and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty there may be in it, before that of the <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> We have likewiſe manifeſted that the Proofs of his Method, have not that juſt and due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41961:41"/> neceſſary to the forming of a judicious man's Mind: and which ours have. Tenthly, and laſtly, It has bin proved to him that diſcreet Perſons, who know our Proofs of Fact, and have examined them, may juſtly reject this Treatiſe as uſeleſs.</p>
                        <p>WHAT he then ſaies concerning theſe two contrary Evidences that hold the Mind in ſuſpence between our Proofs of Fact, on one hand, and the Arguments of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> on the other, is a meer Fancy. For this Unreſolvedneſs is impoſſible in a man of Judgment. And Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does not ground it but only on a Suppoſition, which he has no right to make, <hi>That</hi>

                           <hi>the Proofs of the Treatiſe intimate the impoſſibility of a Change, to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Evidence, as will convince the Mind as much as the contrary Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> Which I deny him, and that with good Reaſon, when I compare his Proofs with ours. His Proofs are grounded on a Suppoſition, in which it is impoſſible to be aſcertain'd, they are of the kind of moral Impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which never carry in them a Certitude beyond Exception, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the Subject or Matter they handle, makes them ſtill a thouſand times more uncertain and doubtful; for what is more uncertain than that which depended on Peoples Inclinations, who lived ſeven or eight hundred Years ago, and on the Conjunction of a thouſand things, of which we ſcarcely know one. We need but conſider theſe Proofs in this reſpect, to declare them uncertain; But to demonſtrate the falſity of them, we muſt compare them with ours, againſt which there can no general Objections be made, ſeing they are numerous, and throughly handle the Queſtion, and which taken ſeverally, have all poſſible Strength and Evidence.</p>
                        <p>TO find out diſtinctly and clearly the knot of this whole Controverſy, and judge of it with leſs Trouble and more Solidity, it needs only be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> and I do make almoſt the ſame Suppoſitions, and draw the ſame Conſequences, but each of us in his own Favour. He ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes my Proofs of Fact are uncertain, and I do not only ſuppoſe they of his Treatiſe are ſo, but that they are moreover Falſe. He ſuppoſeth that they of the Treatiſe are Evident. I ſuppoſe that mine are ſo. He concludes mine are to be Rejected, and them of the Treatiſe Embraced. I conclude that they of the Treatiſe are to be Rejected, and mine Entertained. For to judge aright ſo far, it needs only be conſidered which of us two has moſt reaſon to make theſe Suppoſitions, and ſettles them on ſureſt Grounds; for he that does ſo, has the Conſequence for him. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> grounds his on the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſms of my Rhetorick,</hi> on ſome pretended Teſtimonies of the Learned, and his own Judgment on Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book, and that of the <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> I build mine on the Right a Reſpondent has to ſuppoſe his Opinion in a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. Whence I conclude, I may ſuppoſe my Proofs of Fact to be good and firm; I ground them on a general Compariſon I make of his Proofs with ours, and manifeſt that ours are according to a natural and direct Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and his according to an indirect and forced one; That ours are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to enable a man to make a ſound and ſolid Judgment, and that his are not ſo, that ours are obvious to Sence, whereas his are but meer Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures. And 'tis upon this we ought to be judged. But we muſt proceed far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> goes ſo far as to ſuppoſe his Proofs and mine appear equally evident, and 'tis upon this that he grounds the whole Argument of his ſixth Chapter. He would have that theſe two contrary Evidences form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Suſpenſion of Mind, a rational Man is thereby obliged to determine himſelf by the Advantages which appear moreover in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                           <pb n="52" facs="tcp:41961:42"/> and here we begin to take two different ways, for I will not grant him the Evidence of his Treatiſe, as he grants me that of my Proofs. And in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect no man may make groundleſs Suppoſitions, which being impoſſible, cannot therefore be reaſonable. Now it is not poſſible that a man who is perſwaded of the Evidence of our Proofs, can find any Evidence in his, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch as they are, becauſe they have a Defect in their kind, which makes them vaniſh before ours. 'Tis moreover on this we ought to be tried.</p>
                        <p>YET let us ſuppoſe, by way of Divertiſement, theſe two contrary Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences which hold us in Suſpenſe, what follows thence? that we muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> This indeed Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> ſaies: and I maintain we ought wholly to apply our ſelves to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and leave thoſe Perplexities touching the Opinions of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> that we may ground our Faith only on the Word of God; and I pretend by this means we ſhall adhere to the reformed Church. What muſt we then do about this new Difference? Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> and I muſt Diſpute concerning the Scripture and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to know which of us two has moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And theſe are the Effects of this <hi>admirable Method, the Glory of our time, and Quinteſſence of Humane Wit,</hi> which after ſeveral windings and turnings, ſeveral hot Debates and ſharp Diſputes, and after an Invitation of all <hi>France;</hi> and all them of either Communion to the beholding of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Conteſt, refers the matter at length to the Holy Scripture and the Church. And this is the fruit of the Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if we continue to diſpute after this manner, I think the World has lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reaſon to concern it ſelf in our Debate, ſeeing 'tis a vain amuſement. We wreſtle againſt one another with all our Might, we ſweat, and take a great deal of Pains, and make our Books be bought dear: and after all we are to begin again. For if we muſt now diſpute concerning the Holy Scripture and the Church, wherefore did we not do ſo in the beginning? Wherefore muſt the Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> be for a Preludium to this? Is it becauſe the Gate of this Controverſy is not yet wide enough of it ſelf, but that the Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> muſt introduce us? Or is it not worthy our regard, and therefore the Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> muſt be its Mediatour. Is it that either the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Scripture have need, (to the end they may be recommended to us,) the one of the Treatiſe of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity,</hi> and the other of my Anſwer, and that no man can betake himſelf to either of theſe without our Guidance. For my part I pretend not to this, and therefore think it beſide the Purpoſe to begin a new Controverſy.</p>

                           <p>The ſix laſt Chapters of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Book Examined.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>MR <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s laſt ſix Chapters of his firſt Book being only as looſe Pieces, which relate not to the Method of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> nor our Proofs of Fact; and the greateſt part of them conſiſting in fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Digreſſions, which have no connexion with the Subject of the <hi>Euchariſt:</hi> it ſeems thereupon he has intended them only as an enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his Book, and as a means to tire his readers Patience. Which will oblige me to make only a ſuccinct Anſwer, it being unreaſonable to carry off the Debate to other Subjects, and charge my ſelf with unneceſſary matters: but howſoever conciſe my Anſwer may be, yet will it manifeſt the weakneſs and folly of all theſe tedious and troubleſom Diſcourſes of Mr. <hi>Arnaud.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>HIS ſeventh Chapter reſpects an Objection I made againſt the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> concerning the Infallibility he attributes to the People; which he grounds on this, that People naturally will not ſuffer their Opinions to be ſnatched from them, nor Novelties introduced in matters of Religion; for I had intimated that this would oppoſe the Infallibility which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> attributes to the Popes and Councils. The remaining part of the firſt Book is ſpent in treating on ſome other Innovations, which we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to have inſenſibly crept in, as that in the Eſtabliſhment of Epiſcopacy, praying for the Dead, the invocation of Saints, and prohibition of certain Meats. Theſe are the things I intend to treat of in this Chapter. That I may proceed orderly, I ſhall firſt examine this pretended <hi>popular Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> by comparing it with the Infallibility of Popes or Councils, for we muſt ſee whether I had not reaſon to make againſt the Author of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity</hi> the Objection contained in my Preface. This Queſtion will be ſoon ended, if it be conſidered that I have alleaged ſome Examples of the Inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Alterations which actually hapned in the Church, in ſeveral Points, as <note place="margin">Perpetuity of the Faith, Part 2. C. 7.</note> well Practical as Speculative, and that the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> could not defend himſelf but by proteſting. <hi>That he has not offered in general this Maxim, that there could not happen in the Church any imperceptible Change, in the uſe of Ceremonies, or in Opinions which are no ways Popular, but Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative, that he has bin cautious of propoſing of it in this generality, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore has reſtrained it to capital Myſteries, which are known to all the Faithful, by a diſtinct Faith.</hi> To anſwer after this manner, what is it but to confeſs a Change has hapned in Points, which are not popular. Which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion abſolutely overthrows the Infallibility claimed by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IT is to no purpoſe that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> diſtinguiſhes <hi>betwixt an Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 1. C. 7.</note> 
                           <hi>of Grace or Priviledge, and a humane and popular Infallibility, and to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert that the Author of the</hi> Perpetuity <hi>doth in no wiſe pretend to diſavow the Infallibility of the Church and Councils, as it reſpects all kind of Myſteries, whether Popular or others.</hi> For theſe Examples I produced, do equally op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41961:43"/> all manner of Infallibility, and to acknowledg it in any kind, would be to let go this pretended <hi>Infallibility of Priviledge.</hi> I will ſuppoſe the Alterations I mentioned to have hapned in Points not Popular, yet are they Innovations nevertheleſs, and when they were not contrary to the natural Infallibility, yet would they be to that which is termed of Grace, ſeeing that they are actual Alterations in Points of Religion. Whence it follows, that a man who believes them to be true, cannot deny but that he acts contrary to the Principle of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is, that the Popes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils are only Infallible, and that Mr. <hi>Arnauds</hi> Diſtinction is a meer Illuſion: for if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has admitted an Alteration in Points not Popular, ſhe is not then Infallible in reſpect of theſe Points. 'Tis certain that the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> was minded to wrangle about ſome of the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples I produced, pretending the Doctrine of Faith has not bin altered, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho the Practice of it has bin ſo; but he does not oppoſe what I alleaged touching the Doctrine of Grace, which is not a Point of Practice but Belief, contenting himſelf only with ſaying, <hi>That the Truths of Divine Grace have</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Perpetuity of the Faith. Part 2. C. 7.</note> 
                           <hi>never bin popular in all the Conſequences which have bin drawn from them in Theology, and that 'tis falſe, they are not ſtill the ſame in principal and eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Points.</hi> But is not this ſtill to acknowledg that in reſpect of Points not Popular, and which are neither principal, nor eſſential, in the matter of Grace, there has hap'ned a Change. Now theſe Points whatſoever they be, whether principal or not, great or ſmall, are Doctrinal Points which cannot be altered, without paſſing over from Truth to Error, or from Error to Truth. If then it be true, as I have already ſaid, and as the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> has not denyed, that the Church has bin ſeveral times of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Opinions, upon which account it is impoſſible, but ſhe has bin in Error, and conſequently ſhe is not Infallible in this Infallibility of Grace, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg attributed unto her. The Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi>'s Anſwer doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently ſuppoſe the actual reality of this Change; it has then given me juſt Occaſion to make this Objection I have made, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction comes too late.</p>
                        <p>IT is in vain, he aſſures us, that the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity never had the leaſt thought of denying this Infallibility of Priviledg and Grace;</hi> The Queſtion here is not to know abſolutely what that Author believed, or not believed, what he thought, or did not think; when this ſhall be queſtioned, we ſhall always be ready to hear Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Relation of that matter; but here it concerns us to enquire into the Conſequences which may be drawn from his Terms, and whether he hath given me a juſt occaſion to make that Objection againſt him in my Preface. It will not be ſufficient to make De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations on this Matter, it muſt be ſhewed that the Conſequence is not true.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> imagins, he has ſufficiently juſtified his Friend, in aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he made not uſe of the <hi>Infallibility of Priviledg,</hi> becauſe 'tis a Priviledg to be proved, and not ſuppoſed, and the Calviniſts denying it, it is thence clear, that to make an advantagious uſe of it, it ſhould have bin eſtabliſhed before, which is to ſay, there ought to have bin an intire Treatiſe made of the Churches Infallibility, before it could be made uſe of in this Diſpute. <hi>But,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to conclude from thence, he hath denyed it, and doth not acknowledg it, is one of the moſt raſh Conſequences as ever was drawn, altho that Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>hath done this in the Preface of his Book.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:41961:43"/>
                        <p>AND this is Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s true Character, that he is never more fierce, than when he is Gravelled, or alleageth things wholly beſides the Purpoſe. We have not grounded our preſent Objection on the Author of the <hi>Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity</hi>'s not uſing <hi>the Infallibility of Priviledg</hi> for his Principle, this is a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful miſtake. For it has bin grounded on this, that the terms of his Anſwers to the inſtances of a Change, which I had affirmed, do oppoſe this Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends to, and acknowledg no other but that of the People. Now 'tis to this he ſhould apply himſelf, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually entertain us with impertinent <hi>Digreſſions.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>MOREOVER, what ſignifies his telling us, that the <hi>Infallibility of Priviledge</hi> is a Principle to be proved, and not ſuppoſed, and that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon diſſwading the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> from making uſe of it, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we deny it. We no leſs deny the pretended <hi>popular Infallibility,</hi> which is a Principle needs proving, as much as the other. He himſelf tells us, in the beginning of his eighth Chapter; that the Principle of inſenſible Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which is directly oppoſite to that of <hi>popular Infallibility, is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Foundation to the Calviniſts, whereon to build the greateſt part of their Doctrines, and that all this great Machine of the pretended Reformation, conſiſting of ſo many different Opinions, has almoſt need upon all Occaſions of this Suppoſition, That the contrary Opinion which it undertakes to overthrow, has bin inſenſibly Introduced into the Church.</hi> And thus does he ſpeak, when he would have us deny him his Principle; but when he would have us grant it him, he then holds another Language. <hi>The Author of the</hi> Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity, <note place="margin">Lib. 1. c. 7.</note> 
                           <hi>ſais he, does not deſign to attribute to the People any other Infallibility than that which all the World allows them, and which Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>doth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf grant.</hi> Never any Perſon diſpoſed more freely of other mens Thoughts then Mr. <hi>Arnaud.</hi> We Deny, we Confeſs, according as he pleaſes, he brings us on his Stage as often as he liſt; making us ſay ſometimes one thing, and ſometimes another, and is not this to Diſpute ſucceſsfully? But whether we Confeſs or Deny this his <hi>popular Infallibility,</hi> it is all one to me, for here the Queſtion is not about this, but to know whether the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> has not oppoſed the <hi>Infallibility,</hi> attributed to the Pope and Councils; this is the true State of the Controverſy, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is at a loſs how to defend himſelf from it.</p>
                        <p>WHAT ſignifies his telling us, <hi>that there are an infinite number of things,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 1. C. 7.</note> 
                           <hi>wherein not only the whole Church, and all the People of the Univerſe, but a particular number of People, a Province, a City, a Borough, a particular Perſon, is Infallible, that is to ſay wherein it cannot happen he ſhould be deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, nor would deceive others?</hi> Wherefore muſt we have the <hi>Gaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier</hi> brought in for an Inſtance of this, who is Infallible, when he tells us any conſiderable News, ſuch as is the Kings going into the low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, the taking of Cities in <hi>Flanders,</hi> the Canonization of St. <hi>Francis de Sales,</hi> the Death of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſeventh, and the Election of <hi>Clement</hi> the ninth; If he relates this News only, to advertize us, he began his Book after the Kings Victories in the low Countries, every man may believe as much as he thinks fitting, for we know it is no hard matter to add a Period or two to the beginning of a Book, altho 'tis already far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced; but be it as it will, I dare ſay, that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Victories will not be ſo certain as thoſe of our Monarch. If in effect he hath not mentioned this to us, but to confirm by Examples his <hi>popular Infallibility,</hi>
                           <pb n="56" facs="tcp:41961:44"/> I have reaſon to tell him, that theſe Inſtances are beſides the matter in hand, for there muſt be a diſtinction made, betwixt an <hi>Infallibility</hi> grounded on the Teſtimony of a ſingle Perſon, or a particular ſort of People, and that which is grounded on a whole Body of People. I would call the firſt if you will <hi>an Infallibility of Teſtimony,</hi> and the ſecond, <hi>an Infallibility of Perſeverance in one and the ſame State.</hi> There is a Difference betwen theſe two. The firſt of theſe may be attributed to a People, a Church, a Province, a City, or a particular Perſon, without the ſecond. I will grant likewiſe 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, in certain Caſes, for the whole Body of a People to be miſtaken in the News it relates, tho to ſpeak the truth even this happens not ſeldom, there being nothing more uſually falſe than popular News. But tho I grant this is Impoſſible in ſome Caſes, yet this is far enough from acknowledging, that a People governed by certain Perſons, may not inſenſibly without any Noiſe, alter their Sentiments, and paſs over into an Opinion which they knew not before. For to make ſuch a kind of Change as this is, there needs only the Concurrence of two or three great Perſons in Authority, to whom all Buſineſſes are referred. We have ſeen that the face of things in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> hath bin changed not long ago, and which hath bin ſurprizing to ſeveral Perſons; Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> himſelf has bin intereſſed in ſome of theſe Changes, and I ſuppoſe he would be ſorry if the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the ſame State, ſhould have bin as firm and unmoveable as the Account which the <hi>Gazetier</hi> gave us of the <hi>Death of Pope</hi> Alexander. But after all, this does not hinder but that the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> has op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Infallibility the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ordinarily pretends to.</p>
                        <p>AND this is what I would have told Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> had he done me the Honour he mentions, which is, to have conferred with me about my Objection, and perhaps my Anſwers would have ſatisfied him. I would have added two Obſervations, which would have made him better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that his pretended <hi>popular Infallibility</hi> does not well accord with that which he termeth of <hi>Grace,</hi> or <hi>Priviledge.</hi> The firſt of theſe Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations is, that popular Myſteries being only neceſſary to Salvation, if ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently preſerved by natural means, that is to ſay, by the inviolable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of the People, there is no great need of the Infallibility of <hi>Grace;</hi> which will be at fartheſt, only neceſſary to the Doctrines which are not popular, that is, to the Queſtions of the Schools, which the Church may well be without, and which are but (as ſpeaks the Author of the <hi>Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity,) Theological Conſequences.</hi> The ſecond is, that the Reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> choſe rather the <hi>popular Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> for his Principle, than that of <hi>Grace,</hi> ſuppoſeth that this latter is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely leſs evident, and harder to be proved than the firſt. <hi>This Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Church, ſaies he, being denied by the Hereticks, cannot be made uſe</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 1. C. 7.</note> 
                           <hi>of as a Principle againſt them, unleſs we eſtabliſh it by ſeparate Proofs. For the</hi> Calviniſts <hi>without doubt would not take themſelves to be ſufficiently refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, upon the Subject of the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>if we only contented our ſelves with bringing theſe Arguments againſt them. All Doctrines which are condemned by an Infallible Church are falſe: But the Belief of the</hi> Calviniſts <hi>on the Sacrament is condemned by the Catholick Church, which is Infallible: Therefore it is falſe. Not but this Reaſoning is good: but the minor Propoſition which ſaith that the Catholick Church is Infallible, being a controverted Point, it is thence plain, that before it can be made uſe of, it muſt be proved, that is to ſay, there ought to be made an intire Treatiſe touching the Churches Infallibility, before this Point could be uſed. For this Infallibility is not a thing clear in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41961:44"/> it ſelfs ſeeing it wholly depends on the Will of God, reavealed in Scripture, The Church not being naturally Infallible, 'tis then by the Principles of Faith, or by a long Train of Arguments, that it muſt be proved ſhe is ſupernaturally ſo.</hi> Now to make this Argument good, we muſt ſuppoſe that this Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of <hi>Grace</hi> cannot be proved but with a great deal of Difficulty, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Courſe is taken, whether by Scripture or Reaſon, for if it could be clearly and briefly proved from Scripture, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Excuſe would be vain, for he would be demanded wherefore the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> has not done it, ſeeing we require not Arguments where the Scripture plainly expreſſes it ſelf. His reaſoning then to be concluſive, muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe 'tis impoſſible for the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> to prove the <hi>Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Grace,</hi> without engaging himſelf in Prolixities and Difficulties. Whence it plainly appears, that this is not a proper Principle for the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, who are not able to go thro with a long and difficult Diſcuſſion. It is of no uſe to them, according to Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> and that ſo much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he himſelf hath told us that ſhort and eaſy ways are needful to ſuch, whereby they may diſcern the true Church; <hi>Ways,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 1. C. 3. P. 17.</note> 
                           <hi>free men from thoſe painful Dicuſſions, which Ignorance, dulneſs of Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the Exigences of Life, do make ſo many Perſons uncapable of.</hi> So that this Principle of the Churches Infallibility, being not to be proved without a great deal of Difficulty, will be only ſerviceable to the Learned, and of which in effect they have no great need, ſeeing they can of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves attain the Knowledg of particular Doctrines, without the help of Authority. And to this is reduced, thro Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s means, this <hi>Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Grace and Priviledge,</hi> which has made ſuch a noiſe in the Romiſh Communion.</p>
                        <p>THE remaining part of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Book, treats, as I already ſaid, on ſeveral other Alterations, which we pretend, have inſenſible crept into the Church. But ſeeing theſe are Points which do not at all belong to the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and cannot be well examined without writing a great Volum on each of them, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> therefore may take the Liberty, of ſaying what he pleaſes concerning them, for I think my ſelf no ways bound to anſwer him. When he ſhall aſſault the Books of Mr. <hi>Saumaiſe, Blondel,</hi> or <hi>Daillé,</hi> after the manner he ought, he will not perhaps want an Anſwer. It is an eaſy matter, to joyn three or four Paſſages together, on any Controverſy, and thereupon make Declamations. For this is the common courſe of the World. People uſually begin where they will, and end when they pleaſe: but were one of theſe Books I mentioned, examined to the Bottom, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular undertaken, I am ſure this would not be ſuch an eaſy Task.</p>
                        <p>THE ſuppoſition of inſenſible Alterations, is a Principle the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture eſtabliſhes, which right Reaſon alloweth and Experience confirmeth. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us of a Myſtery of Iniquity, which began to appear in his time, and which would, in the end, produce this great effect, he calls a Revolt, or Apoſtaſy; which has all the Characters of an inſenſible Change, ſeeing that the Foundations of it were laid in his time, and at length theſe myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Projects ſhould come to their Perfection. Our Reaſon likewiſe tells us, that important Alterations which happen in Societies, are never introduced all of 'em at one time, but are brought in gradually; and that it is eaſier to joyn ſuccesfully together ſeveral particular Innovations, each one of which apart ſeems inconſiderable, and to make thereby a great Alteration, than if
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41961:45"/> this ſhould be undertaken all at once. This is a Maxim amongſt all Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Perſons who are capable of proſecuting any Enterprize, but this many times happens of it ſelf without any Deſign. Experience it ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms this by ſundry Examples; for 'tis after this manner ſeveral Arts and Sciences arrive at Perfection: Languages and Cuſtoms of Countries are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; 'Tis after this manneer the Power of Princes and other States are encreaſed or diminiſhed; and not to ſeek for Inſtances of this kind, any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than in the Church, and Chriſtian Religion, by this means hath the Authority of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prelacy arrived through ſeveral Ages to that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree wherein we now ſee it. Thus were the antient Ceremonies in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Baptiſm abrogated, and other new ones adopted in their places. Thus has the Opinion of the abſolute neceſſity of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to the Salvation of little Children, bin aboliſhed, and we have paſſed over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a contrary Opinion. <hi>Null us,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin, Qui ſe meminit Catholicae</hi>

There is no Chriſtian who holds the Catholick Faith, that either denys, or doubts but that little Children, who have not received the Grace of Regeneration in Jeſus Chriſt, nor participated of the Nouriſhment of his Fleſh and Blood, are deprived of everlaſting Life, and conſequently ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to eternal Damnation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>LET Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> inform us how this publick Belief came to be changed. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells us that 'tis an Article of the Catholick Faith, he aſſures us there is no Chriſtian who doubts of it, that is, it was a <hi>popular Opinion:</hi> And yet at this day the contrary is held in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> how comes this Change? We might produce ſeveral other Inſtances, if they were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: but at preſent one Example is ſufficient, to overthrow this falſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s, and to eſtabliſh that which appears to him to be ſo Unreaſonable.</p>
                        <p>YET to ſpeak a word, on each of theſe Points he has handled, does he think, that on the Subject of Epiſcopacy, his Diſcourſes will carry it away from St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> who tells us, <hi>That before there were partialities in Religion,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Hier. Com. in Epiſt. ad Tit. C. 1.</note> 
                           <hi>and that the People cryed out I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and I of</hi> Cephas, <hi>the Church was governed by a Common-Council of Prieſts, but ſince, every one eſteeming them whom he had baptized belonged to him, and not to Chriſt, it was ordained throughout the whole World, that one alone choſen from amongſt the Prieſts, ſhould be ſet up above the reſt, and have the Charge of the Church committed to him, to take away thereby all Occaſions of Schiſme.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>DOES he think that in the Point of Praying for the Dead, we will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon the Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who tells us in his ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Cor.</hi> Chap. 5. <hi>That if our earthly Houſe of this Tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a Building of God, an Houſe not made with Hands, eternal in the Heavens.</hi> Theſe Words do not ſuffer us to doubt but that they who dye in the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt do enjoy his glorious Preſence in Heaven, whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows they have no need of our Prayers. That if the Antients have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the deceaſed in their Prayers, it is certain they never deſigned thereby to deliver them from the Pains of <hi>Purgatory</hi> which they undergo to ſatisfy for their Sins, which is the end the Church of Rome doth at this day pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in its Prayers. <hi>We Celebrate,</hi> (ſaith an antient Author in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries <note place="margin">Com. in Job L. 3.</note> on <hi>Job,</hi> which are thought to be <hi>Origens) Not the Day of our
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41961:45"/> Birth, but that of our Death; for the day of our Birth is an Entrance into Sorrows and Temptations; but that of Death is on the contrary, the end of Sorrows, and a Freedom from all Temptations. We commemorate then the Day of Death, becauſe they who ſeem to dye, do not ſo. And for this reaſon we celebrate the memory of the Saints, and devoutly commemorate our Fathers, or Friends who have departed in the Faith, as well to refreſh our ſelves by the remembrance of the Felicity which they enjoy, as alſo to deſire of God, that we may continue in the ſame Faith.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>DOES Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> expect in that Article of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s touching the Invocation of Saints: that we ſhould believe him rather than <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen,</hi> who ſpeaks in the Name of all the Chriſtians in his time, in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute againſt <hi>Celſus,</hi> who would have them to worſhip the Sun, Moon and Stars, ſeeing they are Celeſtial Angels. <hi>We believe ſaith he, we ought not</hi>

                        <p>WOULD we keep to the exact Rules of Controverſy, we need not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to any farther Examination of the reſt of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s great Volumn, which may be ſaid, without breach of Charity, equally to offend both in its quantity and quality. For having ſhewed, as I have done, that the Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity of the Faith</hi> ought to be rejected, upon the only conſideration of its Method, it is hence evident I am not obliged to follow Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> in his Voyages to <hi>Greece, Muſcovia, Perſia, Syria, Egypt, Aethiopia,</hi> and the <hi>Indias.</hi> Seeing we will never part with our Proofs of Fact, what need has he of travelling thro all theſe Countries? Neither the <hi>Greeks</hi> nor other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Nations, conſidered from the eleventh Century, or from the ſeventh, will decide the Queſtion touching what has bin believed in the antient Church, to the Prejudice of the <hi>Fathers</hi> and their Teſtimony. Yet ſhall I make him an exact Anſwer, not out of any Neceſſity, but only out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion, and upon condition he will remember that I have proved in this firſt Book theſe following Particulars.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. That his Cenſure touching what I ſaid concerning Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book, is grounded on an extravagant Fancy; That it cannot bear a rational
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41961:46"/> Interpretation; nor is made with any kind of Sincerity; that it ſuppoſeth a great Miſtake; that we may conclude thence a Prevarication againſt the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and in fine, may be refuted by Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s own Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Which is the Summary of the firſt Chapter.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. That the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi>'s Method is Indirect, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Nature, ſeeing he would decide Queſtions of Right by Matters of Fact, and Queſtions of Fact by Proofs drawn from Arguments: which is ſuch a diſorderly way of Proceeding, as makes his Method juſtly ſuſpected to be artificial and deceitful.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. That the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> has openly aſſaulted Mr. <hi>Auber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>'s Book, and that after an indirect and artificial Manner, which lies as a Prejudication againſt him. Which is the Summary of the ſecond Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. That the Deſign of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> being to deſtroy the Impreſſion which the Proofs of Fact, or the Paſſages out of the <hi>Fathers</hi> have made on our Minds, does nothing leſs than this, whence it follows that his Treatiſe is wholly Uſeleſs. Which are the Contents of the third Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. That Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> contradicts the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to defend him, and ruins the whole Deſign of his Treatiſe.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. That theſe Methods of <hi>Preſcription,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſo much glories in, are vain and ineffectual, and that the Courſe we take to confirm People in the Doctrines of our Church is ſhort, certain, and eaſy to the meaneſt Capacities: whereas thoſe Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> offers, are tedious, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, uncertain, and unintelligible to ordinary Apprehenſions: Whence it follows they cannot with a ſafe Conſcience remain in the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">VII. That the Abridgment of our Proofs of Fact, which I offer'd in my firſt Anſwer, has bin regular; and that the Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> is but a mear Chaos of Confuſion. Theſe three laſt Particulars are contained in the fourth Chapter.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. That all thoſe pretended Advantages Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> hopes to obtain by means of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> in relation to the Learned and Unlearned, and to thoſe he terms the Obſtinate; are groundleſs Imaginations, which in fine do only manifeſt the Unprofitableneſs of that Treatiſe. Which is the Subject of the fifth and ſixth Chapters.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX, And laſtly, that he cannot excuſe the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> nor himſelf from the Charge of Contradicting and Oppoſing the Infallibility of Popes and Councils, it being an avowed Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> Which is the Contents of this ſeventh Chapter.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>WE are now come to treat of the Belief of the <hi>Greek,</hi> and other <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches, touching <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and the adoration of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſhelter our ſelves from the violent Inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> and his Friends. We need not mention how this has bin the Subject of their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, ſeeing all the World knows it. For the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> has <note place="margin">2d. Part of the <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> C. 5. P. 256.</note> already thereatned us with producing of twenty Millions of Witneſſes on his ſide; and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> who is not a Perſon of that Humour as to abate any thing, is continually charging us with <hi>Abſurdities, Raſhneſs, Confidence, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, Demonſtrations, and telling us of Miniſters confounded by the number of his Proofs.</hi> He tells the World in his Preface, <hi>that he hath left us no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">P. 11.</note> 
                           <hi>to doubt, in a matter ſo apparent as is that of the Conſent of all theſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches, in the Doctrine of</hi> Tranſubſtantiation. He tells us moreover in <note place="margin">L. 2. C. 2. P. 113.</note> another place, <hi>that this is a Point moſt clear and evident, and that were we not withheld by Obſtinacy, we ſhould confeſs as much our ſelves, and not let our Tongues thus bely our Conſciences.</hi> Nay even before Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Book appeared abroad in the World; it had already gotten the Name of <hi>Invincible,</hi> like to that Legion of old, under the Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> which cauſed Fire from Heaven to fall down on the Heads of its Enemies. And we may truly affirm the World hath not bin wanting to uſher in this his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Victory with their Shouts and Acclamations. Now if it be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> what Advantage he can expect from this whole Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy; He will tell us, <hi>it is the Intereſt of the Catholick Church, and that be</hi>

                           <hi>will never be perſwaded to ſuffer one of its cleareſt Proofs to be ſnatcht out of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41961:47"/> his Hand, ſeeing it eſtabliſheth the Faith of a Myſtery, wherein conſiſteth the Object of its Devotion thro the whole World. That God preſerves all theſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Societies, altho divided from his Church, and ſuffers not the Tyranny of Infidels wholly to ſwallow them up, nor the knowledg of principal Myſteries to be quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſht amongſt them, to the end they may remain as Witneſſes for the Catholick Cauſe, in teſtifying the Antiquity of thoſe Doctrines which the new Hereticks deny.</hi> If he be demanded whether none of the Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> have hitherto made uſe of this Argument; he will tell you, that no <note place="margin">In his Prefa. P. 10.</note> one yet hath exactly handled this matter. Which is to ſay that this great Intereſt of the Catholick Church, and this Proof, which is one of the moſt famous ſhe hath, whereby to eſtabliſh her Faith and Devotion, in reſpect of this Myſtery, was reſerved for Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> and that the Divine Providence has not withheld, for ſo many Ages the Violence of the Infidels, nor put a ſtop to the Progreſs of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> nor preſerved theſe Reliques of Chriſtianity in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> but only for the ſake of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s excellent Treatiſe, which was to be the Admiration of the Univerſe. You muſt not then think it ſtrange, if he himſelf after this, hath judged it worthy to be Preſented to Kings and Princes, and Dedicated even to the Head of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Church, and ſuffer'd ſo many Doctors to make <hi>Panegyricks</hi> in its Praiſe. What farther remains but that it ſhould be compared to the Saviour of the World. And this Honour has not bin wanting to it.</p>

                        <p>TO all which I have no more to ſay, but only that I am not at all concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this pretended Divinity, and that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Thunder has neither ſcared nor hurt me, his twenty Million of Witneſſes are no more in my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion than twenty Millions of Phantaſms; and in ſhort I doubt not but I ſhall prove the Truth of theſe three Propoſitions. Firſt, ſuppoſing that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is able to make good his Pretences concerning the <hi>Greek</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41961:47"/> 
                           <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches, from the eleventh Century to this preſent, it would not hence follow, that either the Alteration here in Queſtion muſt be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, or that it hath not actually hapned, and conſequently, that this tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Diſpute on this Subject is vain and uſeleſs, in reſpect of the main of the Cauſe which I defend. Secondly, That the true <hi>Greek</hi> Church, and others whom the <hi>Latins</hi> call Schiſmaticks have never reckoned <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> nor the Adoration of the Sacrament amongſt the Articles of their Creed. Thirdly, That all Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Endeavours to prove the Affirmative, are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, and that even the greateſt part of his Proofs conclude the contrary of what he pretends. And for as much as it may not be amiſs to enquire into the Reaſons of this his pretended Triumph ſo loudly proclaimed, we ſhall therefore in confirming theſe three aforementioned Propoſitions, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve likewiſe how Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> impoſes on the World, to the end his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings may be the better laid open.</p>
                        <p>TO Evidence then the Truth of the firſt of them, we muſt begin from the State of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches, ſince the eleventh Century, that is to ſay from the time <hi>Berengarius</hi> was condemned, to this preſent, for by this means we ſhall come to know thoſe happy Fields which have furniſhed Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> with ſo many Laurels, and at the ſame time diſcover the firſt of his Artifices, whereby he would conceal the Condition of thoſe Churches, to the end he might make the World believe the Argument he draws from their Conſent, hath all the Weight and Strength which it is poſſible for Arguments of this Nature to have. I ſay ſince the eleventh Century to this preſent, becauſe that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> having divided his Diſcourſe touching the <hi>Greeks</hi> into two parts. The firſt from the ſeventh Century to the eleventh, and the other from the eleventh to this preſent, and having begun with this latter part, I am thereby obliged to follow his order, that I may accommodate my ſelf as much as in me lies to his Method. It muſt then be remembred, the preſent Queſtion only concerns theſe Churches, and eſpecially that of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> from the eleventh Century to this preſent; for we ſhall examine in its place this other part of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Diſcourſe, which reacheth from the ſeventh to the eleventh Century.</p>
                        <p>IT muſt not be imagined, theſe Chriſtian Churches are now in as flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Condition as they have bin heretofore. For they loſt ſoon after the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leventh Century their antient Splendor, being fallen into a moſt profound Ignorance, and corruption of Manners, and a horrid Croud of Superſtitions, and Diſregard to the Myſteries of Religion; Which State of theirs inſtead of being amended by time, has grown every day worſe.</p>

                           <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the tenth of <hi>July, 1667. The Schiſmatical</hi> Greeks, ſaies he, <hi>which are in this City to the Number of three hundred Thouſand, are ſo many Souls to be won to our Saviour, becauſe that in effect, after they have told us they are Chriſtians, and for a Teſtimony thereof have croſſed themſelves, there is no other ſign of Chriſtianity to be expected from them: for as to what concerns Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and other religious Exerciſes they are Names and Things unknown to them. I have oftentimes asked Perſons whom I took to be the moſt intelligent amongſt them, whether there were more Gods than one, and whether Jeſus Chriſt from whom they derived their Name, was God and Man, and ſeveral other Queſtions which are put to Children in</hi> France, <hi>when they learn their Catechiſm. But they all of 'em anſwered they were not ſo deeply learned in Divinity as to anſwer ſuch great Points, and when I told them they were bound to know theſe things under Pain of Damnation, I perceived they were not much troubled thereat, for as they believed nothing, ſo they feared nothing. Now not only the common People and Seculars are no better Learned, but moſt of their Prelates, and others of the Clergy. I have oftentimes asked the Prieſts of religious Orders, who were brought up all their life times in Monaſteries, concerning their Belief, whether they thought there was more than one God, and whether Jeſus Chriſt was the true God, and other principal Myſteries, but I could not find one amongſt them able to anſwer me. And ſome of 'em being aſhamed of their own Ignorance and Stupidity, made this Excuſe, that their Abbot knew all theſe things, but for their parts they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtudied Divinity. And demanding how it was poſſible they could live twenty or thirty Years in a Monaſtery, without hearing any Mention made of theſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Points, they thereupon told me, that in Monaſteries and in all other places, all their Endeavours are laid out in getting their Living;</hi> (He afterwards tells us) that one of the chiefeſt Cauſes of this Diſorder is, that the Patriarch buys his <hi>Patriarchate, and ſells all other Eccleſiaſtical Promotions, and that the Arch-Biſhops, and Biſhops do the ſame to their inferiour Clergy.</hi> Neither muſt we imagine other <hi>Eaſtern Chriſtians</hi> in a better Condition than the <hi>Greeks.

That they were wont every Sunday to kindle a Fire in the middle of the Church, and having caſt Incenſe thereon, every one drew near to take of the Smoak with his Hand, with which carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to their Breaſts, they thought thereby their Sins were chaſed out of their Souls. He adds, <hi>that the Latin Biſhop which was ſent them, after their Reduction, viſited ſeveral Places of his Dioceſs, in which there had no Prelate bin for this thirty Years, where he found ſuch a Degeneracy both as to Points of Faith and Manners, that moſt of them had no more of Chriſtianity in them but the Name.</hi>

                        <p>I ſcarce know what to think of that Cuſtom amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their Dead, a Year after they are buried. If they find their Bodies are not yet conſumed, they examine what remains of them, and if it doth not ſtink, but hath a good Colour, they eſteem that Perſon a Holy Man: But if on the contrary, the Corps be Black or Swelled, they repute him to have bin an ill Liver, and an Excommunicated Perſon. Wherefore it is, that in their form of Excommunication, one of their Imprecations is, <hi>that ſuch a Perſon
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41961:52"/> may not be conſumed after Death, neither in this World nor in that which is to come, but that he may be ſwelled like a Drum.</hi> They verily believe this is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly accompliſhed: And <hi>Leo Allatius</hi> tells us ſeveral Stories of thoſe Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſms which they call <hi>Burcolaques,</hi> which are ſaith he, <hi>Excommunicated Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who being deceaſed torment the living,</hi> and of whom the <hi>Greeks</hi> are as much afraid, as our Children, when we tell them of Fryar <hi>Bourru</hi>'s Ghoſt. Nay ſo greatly are they Prepoſſeſſed with falſe Opinions, as to imagine an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication pronounced by a Chriſtian that afterwards turns Turk, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the ſame Effect, that is to ſay, keeps the Body from Conſuming, and cauſes it to grow hard and ſwell, till ſuch time as this Excommunication be taken off by him who pronounced it, altho never ſo great an Infidel. Which is confirmed by <hi>Leo Allatius</hi> concerning the <hi>Patriarch Raphael,</hi> who to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve <note place="margin">Chriſtoph. Angel. C. 42.</note> the Body of an excommunicated Perſon, was forced to apply himſelf to a Renegado for his Abſolution.</p>
                        <p>WE may reckon in the Number of the Grecian Superſtitions, the belief they have long held, touching a Miracle that happens every Year, in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> on the Saturday before <hi>Eaſter,</hi> which is, That all the Lamps being extinguiſhed, the Patriarch enters alone into the Sepulcher, and God ſends a Beam of Light from Heaven, wherewith he kindles the Torch he holds in his hand, and therewith lights all the reſt. Which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed <note place="margin">Annot. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat. de quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rund.

                        <p>NEITHER do they at all ſuſpect the Truth of another Miracle, which <note place="margin">Chriſtoph. Angel. C. 42.</note> they ſay happens once a Year in <hi>Caire,</hi> near the River of <hi>Nile,</hi> and which laſts from Holy Thurſday to Aſcenſion Day. Which is, that in ſeveral Countries the dead Bodies ariſe out of their Graves: But this Miracle only happens when they celebrate <hi>Eaſter</hi> according to antient Cuſtom; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſhould they Celebrate it according to the new Kalender, the Miracle would infallibly ceaſe, as it fell out about fourſcore or a hundred Years ſince, when the <hi>Greeks</hi> altered the time of the Celebration, upon which the dead Bodies aroſe no more, and the Sacred Fire was alſo withheld from the Sepulcher, which obliged them to the Obſervance again of the former Day, whereupon the Miracles returned. And this Relation we have from <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus Angelus,</hi> and ſome others. We might give a farther Deſcription of the Ignorance and Superſtition of theſe poor People, were not what has bin already mentioned ſufficient to inform the World of M. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s vain Triumphs. For when it ſhould appear that all theſe Sects held <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> and the <hi>real Preſence,</hi> what Advantage would accrue to him thereby? Would it hence appear impoſſible that theſe Doctrines have crept in amongſt them, by the ſame means the true Myſteries of Chriſtianity have ſlipt out; for Ignorance and Superſtition are but ſorry keepers of Evangelical Truths. It is eaſy to impoſe on theſe People whoſe Minds have bin ſo darkned with Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, all marks of Chriſtianity having bin long ſince loſt amongſt them. They may be made believe any thing, being in this reſpect as white Paper, whereon men may write what they pleaſe. There needs but one mans falling into an Errour, to draw all the reſt after him.

                        </argument>
                        <p>HERE is then Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s firſt Deceit detected, which conſiſts in the concealing from us the real Condition wherein this People have ſo long layn, as to Religion, to the end the weakneſs of his Arguments may lye undiſcovered.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond conſiſts in ſetting before us ſeveral impertinent hiſtorical Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, on purpoſe to avert his Readers Mind, from a due Conſideration of thoſe things which he knows would prove diſavantagious to him. It is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt a very diſingenuous Artifice, thus to change the natural Uſe and Order of things, and ſnatch out of mens Sights the true and important Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences may be drawn thence, by ſubſtituting others which are but mere Amuſements. And yet this Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has done: for not being able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that the temporal State of the Eaſtern People, ſince the eleventh Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, hath very much facilitated the Attempts of the <hi>Latins,</hi> eſtabliſhing their Doctrines in thoſe Parts; He thereupon ſuppoſes I affirm the <hi>Greeks</hi> never knew the <hi>Latins</hi> believed <hi>Tranſubſtantiation:</hi> and under pretence of oppoſing this Fancy ſprung from his own Brain, he retails out the Hiſtory of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> to ſhew that the <hi>Greeks</hi> could not be ignorant of the Belief of the <hi>Latins</hi> touching the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> I will not inſiſt at preſent on the little reaſon he had to charge me with this Opinion; I ſhall make it appear in the following parts of this Diſcourſe, that this is his Chimera and not mine. I ſhall only repreſent here the ſame hiſtorical Paſſages, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, in that manner wherein they ought to be propoſed, to make a right Judgment of this Diſpute, and not in that falſe View wherein he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented them. In a Word, I pretend to manifeſt by thoſe very things he has offered and Perverted, That if the <hi>Greeks</hi> and other Eaſtern Chriſtians doe believe <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> as fully as the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet does it not thence follow that this Doctrine has bin perpetual in that Church:
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41961:53"/> ſeeing they might have received it from the <hi>Latins.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>FIRST then Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> takes a great deal of Pains to prove, there has bin a frequent Commerce between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> for he tells us that <note place="margin">L. 2. C. 8. P. 172.</note> 
                           <hi>Piſa, Venice, Rome,</hi> and ſeveral other Cities of <hi>Italy</hi> were full of <hi>Greeks,</hi> That <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was full of <hi>Latins,</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Churches; <hi>that the Armies were uſually made up of</hi> Greek, Italian, <hi>and</hi> French <hi>Soldiers, which were continually in great Numbers at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>where they communicated in the ſame Churches from the Hands of the Patriarch, and Prieſts of that City; That ſo great was the multitude of</hi> Pilgrims, <hi>that they adminiſtred the Sacrament every Day, that Perſons of the greateſt Quality, namely Kings, Princes, and Prelates, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the higheſt Rank, undertook theſe Pilgrimages, and that</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>was then, that is to ſay in the eleventh Century, a place whereunto all the Nations of the World reſorted.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I ſhall not now enter into a Debate concerning what he tells us touching the Chriſtians receiving the Communion at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch and Prieſts of that City. He affirms it without proving it, for there is very little likelyhood that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>erſons of different Churches, who were ſo greatly divided, would receive the Communion together from the ſame Perſon. But be it as it will, I am ſo far from raiſing a Conteſt about this frequent Commerce of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> with the <hi>Latins,</hi> that I take it for granted, to the end I may thereby demonſtrate to Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> the weakneſs of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. For when he ſhall prove, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> believe the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Subſtances, and adore the Sacrament, he may then well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude againſt me, that I have bin guilty of Raſhneſs in denying it: but he cannot any ways thereby advantage his Cauſe, ſeeing it will remain ſtill to be examined, whether theſe People did not receive theſe Doctrines from the <hi>Latins,</hi> by means of their mutual Commerce ſince <hi>Berengarius</hi> was laſt condemned. What I related in the preceeding Chapter touching the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which hath reigned for ſo long a time in thoſe Countries, and the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Superſtitions which were introduced, even without our Knowledg of their Original, will ever render this Suppoſition probable, it being no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult matter to conceive that a Doctrine of this Nature might creep in, in the Dark amongſt ignorant and ſuperſtitious People, who held a perpetual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with others, that make open Profeſſion of this Doctrine.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> proceeds farther, and relates the Hiſtory of the <hi>Croiſado</hi>'s to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the eleventh Century, and in the twelfth, for the Conqueſt <note place="margin">L. 2. C. 10.</note> of the Holy Land; and this Hiſtory does well deſerve our Notice; For there will reſult from it theſe two Truths, the one, that the bad Condition of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and other Eaſtern Chriſtians obliged them, how Proud and Haughty ſoever they might otherwiſe be, to a ſervile Complacency with the <hi>Latins,</hi> and to an accommodation with their Humours and Intereſt: And the other that the <hi>Latines</hi> have not neglected this favourable Occaſion, which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture of Affairs then offered them, to eſtabliſh their Religion in the Eaſt.</p>
                        <p>WE all know in what Condition <hi>Paleſtine, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> lay, when <note place="margin">Guilliel. Tyr. Bell. Sacri. Lib. 1.

The <hi>Saracens</hi> had overrun theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries from <hi>Heraclius</hi> his time, that is to ſay from the ſeventh Century, and the Power of theſe Infidels grew formidable to all the World, whilſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſtrength continually decayed, whether by the Supinity of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41961:53"/> or by the horrible Crimes with which the ſame Emperours diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured their Throne.

                        <p>THIS then was the true State of Affairs amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and other Eaſtern Chriſtians, which forced them to a great Complyance with the <hi>Latins,</hi> from whoſe Aſſiſtance they expected their Eſtabliſhment.</p>
                        <p>THESE Letters of the Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Entreaties of <hi>Alexis,</hi> together with the Sollicitations of <hi>Peter</hi> the <hi>Hermit,</hi> procured the Expedition of the <hi>Latins</hi> into <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> The Succeſs is known; I ſhall ſay no more but that the Chriſtians of that Country, only changed their Maſters; for the <hi>Lattins</hi> ſetled themſelves there, not only as Friends, and Deliverers, but Conquerors, which made all things depend on their Will, for as ſoon as ever they poſſeſſed themſelves of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed <hi>Latin</hi> Biſhops there, and drove out the <hi>Greek</hi> Biſhops from their Churches that would not yield Obedience to the Roman Church, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate themſelves to its way of Worſhip.

                        <p>THIS pretended Moderation of the <hi>Latins</hi> is firſt of all refuted by the ſame Author whom Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> quoted, who is <hi>James de Vitry. James de Vitry,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>Teſtifies that the Chriſtians of</hi> Syria, <hi>who were of the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion with the</hi> Greeks, <hi>had Biſhops of their own.</hi> 'Tis not poſſible for an <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Author to be cited with leſs Sincerity; for theſe are <hi>James de Vitry</hi>'s Words; <hi>The</hi> Syrians <hi>exactly obſerve the Cuſtoms and Ordinances of the</hi> Greeks <hi>in the Celebration of Divine Service, and other Spiritual matters, and obey them as their Superiours. But as to the</hi> Latin <hi>Prelates in whoſe Dioceſſes they live, they</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Hiſt. Orient. C 75.</note> 
                           <hi>freely affirm they obey them with their Mouths, but not in their Hearts, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially, and for fear of their temporal Lords. For they have their own</hi> Greek <hi>Biſhops, and would dread neither the Excommunications nor other Laws of the</hi> Latins, <hi>did they not fear our Lay-men would break off all Trade and Commerce with them. For they ſay amongſt themſelves the</hi> Latins <hi>are Excommunicated.</hi> Now where I pray is Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Sincerity in thus alleaging <hi>James de Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>'s Teſtimony to prove the Moderation of the <hi>Latins,</hi> who obliged not the Syrians to communicate with them unleſs they pleaſed themſelves. Theſe Words of his declare the <hi>Syrians</hi> did ſtill acknowledg their <hi>Greek</hi> Biſhops: But then again on the other hand, that they were conſtrained for fear of their temporal Lords to acknowledg the <hi>Latin</hi> Prelates; and render them an external Obedience: which is expreſly contrary to what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes. And yet he has not contented himſelf with thus alledging <hi>James de Vitry,</hi> in a contrary Sence, but has made a Principle of it; From whence he draws this Conſequence, concerning the other Chriſtians: <hi>We ought,</hi>

                        <p>IN the ſecond place, this pretended Moderation is refuted even by thoſe very Letters which Pope <hi>Paſchal</hi> the ſecond wrote to the <hi>Latins</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt, after the taking of</hi> Jeruſalem, in which he tells them, <hi>he has charged his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi>

Thoſe that publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it relate this Paſſage in a Supplement annexed to the end of the Book, and tell us that theſe Additions are not to be found in any Greek Copy, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Latin Verſion of <hi>Gentian Hervetus;</hi> ſo that the Truth of this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony is doubtful, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> that ſeems to have taken his Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from <hi>Baronius,</hi> ought to have more certainly informed himſelf. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41961:54"/> it be, <hi>Balſamon</hi> lived towards the end of the twelfth Century, about a hundred Years after the entrance of the <hi>Latins</hi> into the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> in a time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their Affairs were in Diſorder; for the Infidels had retaken <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with a great part of thoſe Places which were held by the <hi>Latins:</hi> So that we need not wonder if the <hi>Latins</hi> ſlackned their Rigour towards the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and ſo much the leſs, becauſe it appears by this ſame paſſage of <hi>Balſamon,</hi> that the Infidels gave the ſame Liberty to the <hi>Greek</hi> Biſhops, to exerciſe their epiſcopal Functions in their Dominions.</p>

After this <hi>Dabert</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Piſa</hi> was made Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem; Baldwin</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Ceſarea, William</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Tyre, Adam</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paneada,</hi> and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dioceſſes furniſhed after the ſame manner, as it appears by <hi>Wm.</hi> of <hi>Tyre</hi>'s Account.</p>
                        <p>WE may then I think, without farther Trouble, conclude that the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi> did not omit ſo favourable an Occaſion of Introducing their Religion and particular Doctrines in the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> We may moreover conſider another hiſtorical Paſſage of which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> makes uſe according to his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manner, which is to hinder us from beholding the juſt Conſequences may be drawn thence: This Hiſtory concerns the ſubjecting of the Grecian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to the <hi>Latins.</hi>

He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards produces the Teſtimony of an <hi>Anonymous Greek</hi> Author, which I ſhall here ſet down, and ſo much the rather, becauſe of the Conſequence which may be made of this Hiſtory. <hi>Since the Emperor</hi> Porphyrogennetu'<hi>s</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                           <hi>time, to that of</hi> John Batatza'<hi>s the</hi> Latins <hi>did nothing elſe but Plunder Cities and Iſlands. They expelled the Orthodox Prelates from their Seats, and ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Cardinals in their Places who were of the ſame Belief with them. And this they did at</hi> Conſtantinople, Cyprus, Antioch, <hi>and other Cities, and not content with this, they conſtrained all the People, not excepting the Prieſts and Monks, to be of their Opinion, and Communion, and commemorate the Pope. They were Friends to thoſe that obeyed them; but as to them that reprehended them, they treated them as Hereticks, and thoſe that abhorred their Communion, were puniſhed openly, even to the making them ſuffer Martyrdom; and uſed in the ſame manner as the Kings and Tyrants handled the Primitive Chriſtians. Witneſs the holy Monks of the Iſle of</hi> Cyprus, <hi>whom they kept three Years in Priſon, becauſe they would not Communicate with them, Inflicting on them all
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41961:55"/> manner of Torments, and in fine, not being able to make them acknowledg their Doctrine to be good, being poſſeſſed with Rage they faſtned them to their Horſes Tailes, and drew them over Precipices, cauſing othres to be burnt alive.</hi> John <hi>their Abbot having remained ſome time in the midſt of the Flames calling upon God, one of theſe furious</hi> Latins <hi>ſtruck him down with his Mace into the Fire. And thus did this Holy Man render his Spirit unto his Creator. He farther adds, that the Pope having ſent ſome Monks as Spyes, under pretence of a Pilgrimage to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>they ſaw the Patriarch</hi> Germain <hi>at</hi> Nice, <hi>who complaining of theſe Cruelties, received for Anſwer, that the Pope was troubled thereat, and if the</hi> Greeks <hi>would ſend any to make Peace they would be kindly received, It was only,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>to deride and impoſe on us, that they would have us ſend firſt to them, as it were to accuſe our ſelves, and acknowledg our Error, which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared afterwards by their Letters.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT to the end, we may not think <hi>Leo Allatius,</hi> who relates this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> is ſuſpected by the <hi>Latins,</hi> under pretence that he himſelf is a <hi>Greek</hi> by Birth, it will not be amiſs to ſee the Anſwer he makes. <hi>If this Author, ſaies he,</hi> means the <hi>Greeks, who remaining fixt to their Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, embraced otherwiſe the Truth, he is miſtaaen; For the</hi> Latins <hi>have</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                           <hi>bin ſo far from driving them away, that they have made uſe of them, as often as they have Occaſion. If he means the</hi> Schiſmaticks, <hi>and thoſe that maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Errors of the</hi> Greeks, <hi>he trifles; for how can he imagine, the Catholicks who are ſo Zealous for the Roman Church, ſhould ſuffer in a Country, they had Conquered with the loſs of their Blood, the</hi> Greeks <hi>their Enemies and Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to their Faith, to live unpuniſhed? Theſe erronious People muſt be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, being Rebels to their own Faith, not only by ſimple Baniſhments, but by Fire and Sword.</hi> And this is <hi>Allatius</hi> his Moderation, which does not well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with that which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> attributes to the <hi>Latines.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT we need not oppoſe <hi>Allatius</hi> againſt him, we need but hear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to know whether the <hi>Latins</hi> did not uſe all manner of Violences, to ſettle their Religion amongſt the <hi>Greeks. After the taking of</hi> Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <note place="margin">L. 3. C. 1.</note> ſaies he, <hi>the</hi> Latins <hi>poſſeſſed themſelves of all the Churches; they eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a</hi> Latine <hi>Patriarch, they filled</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>with</hi> Latin <hi>Prieſts, they cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated a</hi> Latin <hi>Emperor, who was</hi> Baldwin <hi>Earl of</hi> Flanders, <hi>and proſecuting their Conqueſt in</hi> Greece, <hi>they brought under their Obedience almoſt whatſoever apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in</hi> Europe <hi>to the Emperours of</hi> Conſtantinople. <hi>The</hi> Grecian <hi>Emperour fled into</hi> Aſia, <hi>having but three or four Cities left him, which were all that for a long time remained under the Obedience of the</hi> Greeks. Behold here then all <hi>Greece</hi> ſubdued not only to the Temporal Authority of the <hi>Latins,</hi> but likewiſe to the Spiritual Authority of the Popes. He adds a little after, <hi>that the Popes Legats uſed ſuch hard and rigorous Courſes to conſtrain the</hi> Greeks <hi>to Communicate with the Pope, that at length the Emperour</hi> Henry, Baldwin'<hi>s Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor was forced to take them off mauger the Legat</hi> Pelagus. He tells us like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <note place="margin">L. 3. C. 7.</note> in another place, <hi>that</hi> Greece <hi>was at that time filled with Dominicans, and Fryar</hi> Minorites, <hi>that is to ſay, Inquiſitors as he himſelf calls them, who had often performed this Office in</hi> France, <hi>and</hi> Germany, <hi>and ſignalized themſelves by puniſhing an infinite number of Hereticks, who made it the greateſt part of their Skill to diſcover them, and a great part of their Piety to have them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely Puniſhed, that theſe Inquiſitors were in ſeveral places Maſters of the</hi> Greeks, <hi>and were ordered by the Pope to Confer with them, and examine their Doctrine.</hi>

For this deplorable Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Greece</hi> and all the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and the violent Means the <hi>Latins</hi> here uſed to plant their Religion, for ſeveral Years together, that is to ſay, for near two hundred Years in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and fifty eight in <hi>Greece,</hi> might well introduce amongſt theſe People, the Belief of a ſubſtantial Converſion, and there is methinks, more reaſon to admire, if this has not hapned, than if it hath.</p>
                        <p>WE are not yet gotten to the end of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Hiſtories. He tells <note place="margin">L. 3. C. 7.</note> us three things worth our Obſervation. The firſt is, <hi>that altho</hi> Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>was retaken from the</hi> Latins <hi>by</hi> Michael Paleologus, <hi>yet they kept ſtill ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places in</hi> Greece, <hi>and even whole Provinces, as</hi> Achaia. Secondly, <hi>that the</hi> Latines <hi>were ſtill Maſters of divers great Iſlands, as</hi> Cyprus, Crete, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beé Rhodes, <hi>and divers other Places.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>that the Neceſſity the Emperours of</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>lay under of obtaining the Aſſiſtance of the Weſtern Princes, cauſed them to keep a continual Correſpondency with ſeveral of them, and to be in ſundry particulars ſubſervient to the</hi> Latins <hi>which remained at</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>ſo that there was always a great number there, who made Profeſſion of the Romiſh Religion.</hi> Here is then the <hi>Latins</hi> again not only mixt with the <hi>Greeks</hi> in their ordinary Commerce; but in ſeveral places their Lords and Maſters, and in a fit Capacity to make them receive their Religion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>LEO Allatius,</hi> tells us likewiſe that, <hi>when the King of</hi> England <hi>had Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed</hi>

                           <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                           <hi>the</hi> Greeks <hi>know,</hi> (theſe are the Words,) <hi>that their Empire, Kingdoms, and Lordſhips, will never be in Peace and Security, but always ſubject to their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, from whom they will continually receive exceeding great Dammages, and perpetual Miſeries, till ſuch time as they ſubmit themſelves to the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>with a true Humility and Charity, obeying its Holy Conſtitutions, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41961:56"/> Ceremonies, and wholly conform themſelves to her Faith.</hi> And after this manner did they make Heaven and Earth meet, to cauſe theſe People to change their Religion.</p>
                        <p>WE may then I think plainly enough ſee, that it has not bin the <hi>Latins</hi> Fault, if the <hi>Greeks</hi> have not received their Doctrines, from whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that if it dos appear they have from that time Believed Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, and it not appearing they held it before, we may then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably conclude, they received it from the <hi>Latins.</hi> This is a Conſequence which follows naturally of it ſelf. The Teſtimony of the <hi>Greeks</hi> cannot be any longer produced as that of the pure <hi>Greeks,</hi> after ſo many endeavours to make them embrace the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the more Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſtrives to prove the Entercourſe of theſe two Nations, the greater hold he gives us to conteſt with him the Advantage he pretends to have obtained from hence. But he uſes an admirable Expedient, to hinder us from minding this Conſequence. For having ſeen on one hand, that theſe Hiſtories were too well known, to be paſſed over wholly in Silence; and on the other, that if he ſhould ſincerely produce them as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they would certainly make for our Advantage, as it hath bin already obſerved; he has thereupon bethought himſelf, and preſented them in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of Dreſs, whereby he may inſenſibly turn aſide his Readers Minds, and amuſe them by an agreeable Diverſion. And to this end has thought good to ſuppoſe, I denyed the <hi>Greeks</hi> knew what was the Belief of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,</hi> and to employ all theſe hiſtorical Paſſages in oppoſing this <hi>Phantaſtical Suppoſition,</hi> that is to ſay, in manifeſting the <hi>Greeks</hi> could not be ignorant of the Belief of the <hi>Latins</hi> touching the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> I ſhall make appear in its proper place, that this is but a vain Pretence, and a meer quibling on Words, which he has deſignedly taken in a Sence contrary to my meaning. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I here declare it never entred into my Thoughts to deny, what he makes me deny. For this is an Invention he has uſed on purpoſe to conceal his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct dealing.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>That the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperors, led by politick Interests, have themſelves favoured the Deſign of the <hi>Latins,</hi> in Introducing their Doctrines into <hi>Greece.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s third Artifice diſcovered.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IT has not bin only the <hi>Latins</hi> that earneſtly endeavoured to make the <hi>Greeks</hi> receive their Doctrines. For even the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have favoured this Deſign; induced by politick Reſpects, which put them upon ſeeking the Friendſhip of the Weſtern Princes, and eſpecially that of the Popes, <hi>who in thoſe times,</hi> as ſpeaks Mr. <hi>Arnaud, gave Laws to all the reſt, and that even in Temporals.</hi> We all know what a great Influence the Inclinations of Princes have, not only on the People, but Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticks and Prelates. It is uſual with Subjects to turn themſelves on that ſide which is moſt pleaſing to their Sovereign, and there are few Perſons who make it not their Buſineſs ſo to do, eſpecially when Princes openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their Minds, and make uſe of their Authority in puniſhing thoſe that withſtand them, and rewarding thoſe that approve them. Now this the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperours have often particularly done, in favour of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to which they have endeavoured to unite their Subjects.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>POSSEVIN</hi> the Jeſuit, reckons up fourteen of theſe intereſſed Reuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <note place="margin">De reb. Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covit. P. 7.</note> 
                           <hi>the</hi> Greeks, ſaies he, <hi>have bin reunited to us fourteen times, by publick Confeſſions, and have ſo many times departed from us. And it is certain that as they have ever known the Popes earneſt Deſires to ſubmit them to the See of</hi> Rome, <hi>ſo likewiſe have they not failed to flatter this Deſire by fair Promiſes, when they needed that Churches Aſſiſtance, either for the obtaining of ſome important Deſign, or for the averting of ſome dangerous Tempeſt which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them. But as ſoon as ever theſe have bin over, they have returned to their firſt State, and ſlighted theſe Reunions. I know not how it hath come to paſs that the Popes having bin ſo often deceived, ſhould ſtill continue ſo Facile; but perhaps it was not a ſingle Intereſt, but be it as it will, the Popes have never bin backwards in theſe Matters.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>MY Deſign is not to ſet down here all theſe Reunions, one after another, and relate their particular Circumſtances, ſeeing an Account thereof is to be met with in ſundry Hiſtorians, but more eſpecially in the Book <hi>Leo Allatius</hi> wrote touching the Agreement of theſe two Churches. I ſhall only here take notice of ſome of them obſerved by Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> and which will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſhew after what manner the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperors have proceeded in Favour of the <hi>Latins,</hi> when they wanted the Pope's Aſſiſtance.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>MICHAEL Cerularius</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Acrida,</hi> having written ſome Letters againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to <hi>Peter</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> thereupon cauſed the <hi>Latine</hi> Churches to be ſhut up at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Eleventh was greatly moved at it. He therefore wrote to <hi>Cerularius,</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> of <hi>Acrida</hi> a long Letter, wherein he
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41961:57"/> anſwered their Objections, and accuſed likewiſe the <hi>Greek</hi> Church of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Raſhneſs, and Preſumption. This hap'ned about the middle of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Century. The Emperor <hi>Conſtantin Monomaque</hi> who then Reigned, ſeeing this Difference, did not ſtick to take the Church of <hi>Rome's</hi> part: he commanded therefore <hi>Cerularius</hi> to write back to the Pope, Letters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation and Peace; and the Pope ſends thereupon to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> (in order to the Churches Re-union) his Legats, <hi>Humbert,</hi> and <hi>Frederic,</hi> Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, and <hi>Peter,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Melphus,</hi> with Letters to the Emperor and Patriarch. The Emperor granted to theſe Legates whatſoever they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, even to the conſtraining <hi>Nicetas Pectoratus,</hi> a <hi>Greek</hi> Monk, that had written againſt the <hi>Romain</hi> Church, to burn publickly his own Book, and anathematiſe all thoſe that would not acknowledg the Pope's Supremacy, or dared in any wiſe cenſure the Doctrines of the <hi>Latins.</hi> This Protection ſo raiſed the Legates Courage, that coming into the Patriarchal Church, in the preſence of all the People and <hi>Greek</hi> Clergy, they Excommunicated the Patriarch and Biſhop of <hi>Acrida,</hi> and all that took their Parts; which raiſed ſuch a Tumult in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that the Emperor had much ado to ſave the Legates from the Popular Fury, who after this returned into <hi>Italy;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Patriarch Excommunicated, on his Side, the Legates, and raſed the Popes Name out of the <hi>Diptyches,</hi> which are Tables, wherein the Names of thoſe that are prayed for in the Divine Service were ſet down. Some Authors ſay, that he Anathematiſed the Pope, and all the <hi>Latines,</hi> as Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; but <hi>Leo Allatius</hi> cites the Teſtimony of an anonymous Author, by which it appears, that the Emperor hindered, by his, Authority this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication. <hi>In the time,</hi> ſaies this Author, <hi>that</hi> Michael Cerularius <note place="margin">Anonym. apud Allat. de perp. Conſ. L. 2. C. 8.</note> 
                           <hi>held the See of</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>the four Patriarchs raſed the Pope's Name out of the</hi> Dyptiches, <hi>and yet did they not fully pronounce the</hi> Anathema <hi>againſt the</hi> Latines, <hi>being hind'red by the Emperor, who conſidered them as a great and mighty Nation, and therefore was afraid of their uſual Incurſions.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IN the Year 1071, <hi>Michael Parapinacius</hi> was made Emperor, being a Prince that loved his Eaſe, and therefore withſtood not the Turks Progreſs into <hi>Europe.</hi> He obſerved the uſual Policy of the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperors, which <note place="margin">L. 2. C. 8. P. 173.</note> was, to favour the <hi>Latines;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> obſerves from <hi>Baronius,</hi> and <hi>Leo Allatius,</hi> that Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſecond, ſent to him <hi>Peter,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Anag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Allet. de Perp. Conſ. L. 2. C. 9.</note> as his Nuncio. <hi>Allatius</hi> adds that <hi>Peter</hi> remained a Year at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi> Which ſhews us, ſaies he, This Emperor was in the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and in effect, <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh Excommunicated, upon his account, <hi>Nicephorus Botionatus,</hi> who had uſurped the Empire, and ſhut up <hi>Michael</hi> in a Monaſtery.</p>
                        <p>IN the Year 1081 <hi>Nicephorus Botoniatus,</hi> was handled by <hi>Alexis Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenus,</hi> in the ſame manner that <hi>Michael</hi> was uſed by <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> that is to ſay, he was deprived of the Empire and ſhut up in a Monaſtery. But <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi> getting into his place, varied not from the Cuſtom of his Predeceſſors: the neceſſity of his Affairs obliging him to turn himſelf on the Side of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,</hi> more openly than others had done before him, and obſerve their Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, altho inwardly he did not affect them. He obſtructed their Deſigns on the Holy Land, as much as in him lay, and hind'red their Paſſage thither, obliging them ſometimes to turn their Arms againſt him, and chaſtize him <note place="margin">Rationar. temp. Part 1. L. 8. C 13. Baron. ad ann. 1095.</note> ſeverely; which cauſed <hi>Pelavius</hi> the Jeſuit, to ſay, <hi>That it was impoſſible for a man to be more deceitful and unjuſt than this Emperor was towards the</hi> Latines <hi>in this whole Expedition.</hi> Yet had he ſent his Embaſſadors to the Council

                           <hi>JOHN Comnénus,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Alexis,</hi> was yet more favourable to the <hi>Latines</hi> than <hi>Alexis,</hi> for this I ſuppoſe is the Jeſuit <hi>Peteau</hi>'s meaning, when he ſaies that he was, <hi>Patre aliquanto commodior, a little leſs troubleſom than his Father.</hi> I do not obſerve there has bin any thing more ſaid of him on this Subject, unleſs, that he received a Letter from <hi>Peter</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Clugny,</hi> in which he entreated him to ſurrender a Monaſtery belonging to them of his Order at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and which had bin taken from them, promiſing he ſhould participate of all the Merits of that Order, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed them. <hi>Baronius</hi> ſaies likewiſe that <hi>Anaclet</hi> the Antypope to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi>

                        <p>AFTER <hi>John</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Manuel Comnénus,</hi> a Prince very much addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Diſſimulation and double Dealing, who on one hand did the <hi>Latines</hi> all the Miſchief he privately could, by the Secret Intelligence he held with the <hi>Sarracens,</hi> and on the other, earneſtly endeavoured at a complyance with the Deſires of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> touching the Re-union of the <hi>Greeks. Allatius</hi> tells us, that he ſent Embaſſadors to Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the <note place="margin">Allat. de Perp. Conſ. L. 2. C. 11.</note> third, to treat with him concerning this Re-union, and that the Pope ſent <hi>John</hi> the Sub-Deacon of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to reduce the <hi>Greeks</hi> by his Sermons. He likewiſe tells us, 'twas this Emperor that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged <hi>Hugo Eterianus</hi> to write againſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> touching the Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt; that the Empreſs his Wife (as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> himſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) after him, was a <hi>Germain</hi> and of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion: and that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed great Gifts on the <hi>Latine</hi> Churches: whereupon the <hi>Latine</hi> Biſhops for an acknowledgment of his Munificence, ſet up his Image in their Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. It is difficult to Imagine how a Prince who in his Heart ſo greatly hated the <hi>Latines,</hi> that the Jeſuit <hi>Peteau</hi> has not ſtuck thereupon to call him, <hi>homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem ſubdolum &amp; Chriſtianis rebus quae ad Latinos ſpectabant infeſtum &amp; iniquum</hi>

                           <hi>adeo, ut cum Saracenis in eorum conſpiraret exitium,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>a Perſon ſo deceitful and cruel to the</hi> Latine <hi>Church, that he conſpired its Ruine, together with the</hi> Saracens, yet ſhould favour the <hi>Latins</hi> in his Empire, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to procure the Re-union of its Church with the <hi>Roman.</hi> But <hi>Allatius</hi> unties the Knot, by ſhewing us in the Acts of <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, that the <note place="margin">Allat. ubi Supra.</note> Deſign of this Emperor was ſo to bring it about, that the Pope who was at Variance with the Emperor <hi>Frederick,</hi> ſhould take away from him the <hi>Latin</hi> Empire, and render it to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> to whom <hi>Manüel</hi> affirmed it did juſtly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41961:58"/> belong: and for this Effect he ſent Embaſſadors to the Pope; and the Pope ſent back together with his Embaſſadors the Biſhop of <hi>Oſtia,</hi> to negociate this Affair at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Howſoever it was, it ſufficiently appears that all theſe different Intereſts yielded the <hi>Latins</hi> fit Opportunities to plant their Doctrines amongſt the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>EMANUEL</hi>'S Intrigue was ſo far carried on, that he aſſembled a <note place="margin">Allat. de Perp. Conſ. L. 2. C. 2. Idem. Ibid.</note> Council at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where the Reunion of the Churches was propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Some ſay, the <hi>Latins</hi> required no more of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> but the Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the Popes Authority, the grant of Appeals, and the Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of him in the publick Prayers of their Church: Others ſay, the <hi>Latins</hi> would have intirely ſubjected the <hi>Greeks</hi> to their Wills and Cuſtoms. That which is certain is, they could not Agree, and that the Emperor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf lent his helping Hand to ſeparate them, yet not daring to Anathematiſe <note place="margin">Ancyr an. apud Allat. Ibid.</note> the <hi>Latins, becauſe,</hi> ſaies a <hi>Greek</hi> Author, Cited by <hi>Allatius, they were a great and famous People.</hi>

                        <p>AFTER the <hi>Latins</hi> had eſtabliſhed their Empire at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> withdrew into <hi>Aſia,</hi> where they choſe an Emperor and Patriarch, and the Affairs of the <hi>Latins</hi> falling to decay, there was an after Tryal made upon the <hi>Greeks,</hi> touching a Reunion. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> obſerves, that the Pope wrote about it to <hi>Germain</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">L. 3.

For each of them had his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Intereſt and Deſign in this Affair.</p>
                        <p>THE Pope intended to ſubject the <hi>Greek</hi> Church to himſelf, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror endeavoured to hinder the Pope from favouring the <hi>Latins,</hi> who held <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and to Regain this City, as the <hi>Greeks</hi> did ſome time after; <hi>Mathew Paris</hi> gives an account of theſe Letters of the Patriarch to the <note place="margin">Mat.

Now the Deputies being returned with the News of the Reunion accompliſhed, the Emperor choſe this ſame above named <hi>John Veccus,</hi> who at length ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelf to be won, either by the reading of ſome Books put into his Hands, or by the Miſeries he had ſuffered during a long Impriſonment, and hope of a contrary Uſage: Yet <hi>Veccus</hi> did not pleaſe him long.</p>
                        <p>IT would be a difficult matter to relate here all the Violences and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties of <hi>Michael,</hi> againſt thoſe that withſtood the Reunion of the two Churches. It will be ſufficient to relate here two or three of them, by which we may judge of the reſt. He Impriſoned <hi>Holobulus Rhetor</hi> of the Church of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whoſe Office, according to <hi>Codinius,</hi> was to Interpret the Holy Scriptures, and cauſed him to be cruelly Scourged, and at length a <note place="margin">Pachymer. L. 5. C. 20 Codin. de Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciis Conſt. Cap. 1.</note> Rope to be faſtned about his Neck, and to be thus expoſed thro out all the City, with his Wife and Neece, together with ten others, bound after the ſame manner, cauſing the two former of theſe to be flapt ever and anon on the Cheeks, with the Entrails of a Sheep, which is amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> a kind of Infamous Puniſhment, wherewith only the Vileſt Offenders are treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thoſe who add Obſtinacy to the Crimes of which they have bin Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He likewiſe Impriſoned four of the Chief Officers of his Houſe, two of which were his Kinſmen, and there kept them a long time laden with <note place="margin">Idem. L. 6. C. 16.</note> Irons. This Severity ſeemed very great, but not content therewith; when the Pope ſent Legates to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to Confirm the <hi>Greeks</hi> in their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him, he made them Witneſſes of his Cruelty towards the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of this Union, commanding a certain Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to conduct them to the Priſon, and ſhew them theſe four Perſons, who were of the chiefeſt Rank in <hi>Greece,</hi> they were in a ſquare Room, each of 'em chained
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41961:59"/> to a corner thereof, and laden with Irons, and that which was an Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Miſery, was to be thus expoſed a Spectacle to their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                        <p>WOULD we know the Motives inducing this Prince to uſe ſo great <note place="margin">Idem. L. 3. C. 18.</note> Severity in this matter. Obſerve we then what <hi>Pachymerus</hi> tells us. <hi>He ſent oftentimes Embaſſadors to the Pope, and endeavoured to gain him by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents. For he plainly perceived the Danger lay on that ſide, and that the</hi> Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>could not lye long Idle; Wherefore he made Propoſals of Union, to the end he might be ſecure as to them, and the better Diſpoſe of his other Affairs. Theſe Embaſſies then were frequent, and the Preſents Magnificent, not only to the Pope, but likewiſe to ſeveral Cardinals, and others whom he judged powerful in the Court of</hi> Rome. In effect as ſoon as ever Pope <hi>Urbain</hi> the fourth, receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Raynald. ad ann. 1262. num. 3. &amp;c. ad ann. 1262.</note> the News of the re-taking of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the Progreſs of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> he earneſtly endeavoured to ſtir up the Princes and People to aſſiſt the <hi>Latins;</hi> he wrote for this Effect, to the Fryar Minorites in <hi>France,</hi> and enjoyned them to Preach a <hi>Croiſado</hi> on this occaſion, with the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences which had bin granted them that undertook the Holy War; he wrote likewiſe to King <hi>Lewis</hi> upon the ſame account; and threatned the <hi>Genoiſes</hi> who favoured <hi>Michael,</hi> (being at Varyance with the <hi>Venetians)</hi> that if they forſook not his Allyance, he would excommunicate them, he wrote to the Prelates of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> exhorting them to contribute to this War, in ſhort he forgot nothing he judged neceſſary in this Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Michael</hi> then ſeeing that the only means to ſhelter himſelf from this Storm, <note place="margin">Raynald. ad ann. 1263. num 22.</note> was to fly to the uſual Policy of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that is to ſay, to negotiate the Re-union of the two Churches; he thereupon wrote to the Pope, Letters full of Reſpect and Affection to the Roman Church, and having received ſuch an Anſwer as he deſired, he earneſtly applyed himſelf to this Buſineſs. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> himſelf is agreed on the Motives which ſet this Emperor at work. <hi>Foreſeeing,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>the Popes would not fail to arm the Weſtern Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">L. 3. C. 2. P. 266.</note> 
                           <hi>againſt him, and that he had a potent Enemy, in the Perſon of</hi> Charles D'Anjou, <hi>King of</hi> Naples, <hi>and</hi> Sicily, <hi>with whom the Emperor</hi> Baldwin, <hi>being driven from</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>was allyed, he reſolved thereupon to reunite the</hi> Greeks <hi>with the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, that he might by this means deliver himſelf from the fear of thoſe dreadful</hi> Croiſado's, <hi>which made the</hi> Greek <hi>Emperors tremble at that time in</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>the</hi> Sultans <hi>in</hi> Babylon <hi>and Grand</hi> Caire, <hi>and the</hi> Tartars <hi>themſelves as far as</hi> Perſia. It is certain, adds he, that this Re-union was carried on upon politick Reſpects.</p>
                        <p>AND theſe in effect were the true Reaſons of <hi>Michael</hi>'s Undertakings; which being his greateſt Intereſt, he therefore left no means unattempted whereby to accompliſh it. Which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does ſtill grant; <hi>We may read,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>in</hi> Pachymerus, <hi>that he endeavoured too violently, to bring the Biſhops over to his Will.</hi> But did he not acknowledg it, we need only <note place="margin">L. 3. C. 3. P. 274.</note> read what <hi>Michael</hi> himſelf ſaies in his harangue to the <hi>Greek</hi> Clergy, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled upon this Occaſion. <hi>I muſt acknowledg,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>that I have ſtiſled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me the moſt tender Sentiments of Nature, to accompliſh my deſign. You know</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Pachym. L. 6. C. 15.</note> 
                           <hi>I loved a Perſon, with the ſame tenderneſs and Reſpect, as if he had been my own Father, and I believed I ow'd him more than my Father, ſeeing he gave me the Communion, and received me into the Boſom of the Church, which I eſteem more than the giving me Life, and yet have I Sacrificed him to this Intereſt. 'Tis the Patriarch</hi> Joſeph <hi>I mean. I have violently handled ſeveral others, even my intimate Friends, and oppreſſed divers among your ſelves. I have moreover
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41961:59"/> ſeveral of my near Kinſmen in Priſon, there having bin no other Reaſon for their oppoſing me, or my puniſhing them, than only this Re-union with the</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins. I think this is ſufficient to Convince us, that this Emperor abuſed his Power in Favour of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I confeſs thoſe that ſucceeded him, altho they had the ſame Opinion touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Re-union, yet uſed not the ſame Extremities, nevertheleſs <hi>John Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léologus</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Raynald. ad ann. 1370.</note> endeavoured earneſtly to effect this, and therefore went in Perſon to <hi>Rome</hi> in great Pomp, to make his Declaration.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>EMANUEL</hi> the ſecond who ſucceeded him, trod in the ſame Steps, addreſſing himſelf to Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the ninth, who publiſhed a <hi>Croiſado</hi> for his Aſſiſtance againſt the <hi>Turks;</hi> and a while after, he treated with <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> the fifth, touching the Reconciliation of the two Churches. In Fine, <hi>John</hi> the ſeventh, <hi>Paleologus</hi> came to the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> and <note place="margin">Syrop. Hiſt. Concil. Flor. Sect. 2. C. 5.</note> ſent his Clergy thither on the ſame Deſign.</p>
                        <p>WE may then well conclude the <hi>Latins</hi> wanted not Opportunities to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce their Religion amongſt the <hi>Greeks.</hi> For firſt it is not to be ſuppoſed but that this great Paſſion theſe Emperors ſhewed towards this Union, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined the Minds and Hearts of ſeveral Perſons, as well of the Clergy as Laity to favour the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, to embrace its Intereſts, and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date themſelves to its Doctrine. We all know how weak and fickle the greateſt part of mankind are, they approve and eſteem whatſoever is in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Credit, there being few whoſe Minds are not Byaſſed even in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious matters, by temporal Advantages. Men commonly in ſuch caſes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to Molliſy and take in a good Sence, that which before was a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Scandal: they enlarge or diminiſh Objects, to bring 'em to the Point they deſire; they hearken to nothing but what is pleaſing, and behold what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever oppoſes their Intereſt in ſuch a manner as ſhall be ſure to render it unjuſt and odious.</p>
                        <p>IN the ſecond place, we need not doubt but this ſame Paſſion of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors obliged ſeveral others to manage theſe Controverſies, and let go di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Articles as being but of ſmall Importance. <hi>All the Schiſmatical</hi> Greeks, <note place="margin">De Perp. Conſ. L. 3. C. 12.</note> ſaies <hi>Allatius, are not like minded towards the</hi> Latins, <hi>ſome of them are more moderate than others, making the Difference conſiſt only in one or two Points; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more Rigorous, for whatſoever the</hi> Latins <hi>do, which agrees not with the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and Rites of the</hi> Greeks, <hi>they Condemn and Reject, as an Abomination.</hi> He Confirms afterwards what he ſaies, by a Paſſage taken out of <hi>Demetrius Comatenus,</hi> which tells us, <hi>that ſeveral moderate</hi> Greeks, <hi>agreed with the</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins <hi>in divers Particulars, acknowledging the proud and fierce Humor of their Nation, which hath almoſt become Barbarous by their frequent Commerce with the</hi> Barbarians, <hi>and that theſe aforementioned have only ſtuck at the ſingle Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle touching the Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> himſelf ſaies, <hi>'twas</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">L. 2. C. 10. P. 200.</note> 
                           <hi>obſerved the</hi> Greeks <hi>were of different Diſpoſitions in thoſe times</hi> (he means in the twelfth Century) <hi>for ſome of 'em maintained the</hi> Latins <hi>ought to be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Hereticks, and others blamed theſe Tranſports of Paſſion.</hi> But 'tis certain even the moſt rigorous amongſt them, only ſtuck to thoſe Points which were openly debated by the two Churches, amongſt which the Principal were touching the Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, and the <hi>Azymes.</hi> The Conſtancy they ſhewed in Reference to theſe Articles, ſufficiently expoſed them to the Hatred and ill Uſage of their Emperors, ſo that we need not
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41961:60"/> deſcend to the Examination of other Particulars, which broke not out into Diſputes on either ſide.</p>
                        <p>NEITHER need we any more doubt but that ſeveral condeſcended to the Will of their Emperors, upon this Conſideration, that altho they were Reunited to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet ſhould they ſuffer no Alteration, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the eſſential Parts of their Religion, or Ceremonies, and that there was no hurt in cheating theſe <hi>Latins,</hi> by this Fancy of a Union, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified nothing at th'bottom, but which yet would yield them great Advantage in their Affairs. And this was the chief Reaſon which <hi>Michael Paleologus</hi> offered to his Clergy, according to <hi>Pachymerus</hi> his Relation, <hi>he ſhewed them,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>that the only Cauſe moving him to procure this Peace with the</hi> Latine <note place="margin">Pachym. Hiſt. L. 5. C. 1.</note> 
                           <hi>Church, was to hinder thoſe Cruel and Bloody Wars which threatned them, and to ſpare his Subjects Blood. That as to the reſt, they might aſſure themſelves, that after the Reunion, their Church ſhould remain as it was, without any Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? That he himſelf would take care of it. That the whole Reconciliation with the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>might be reduced to theſe three Articles,</hi> viz. <hi>The Primacy, Appeal, and Commemoration, all which ſignified nothing, if rightly conſidered. For when,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>will the Pope come to</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>to take Poſſeſſion of this Primacy! who will make Appeals, to end them in ſo far a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who will Croſs the Seas for this. And as to the Commemoration of the Pope in our Patriarchal Temple, and your other great Temple, (when the Patriarch ſhall Officiate there,) being prudent as you are, can this appear ſuch a ſtrange thing to you. Do you not know the Fathers have often made uſe of Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and frequently ſubmitted themſelves for the publick Good. Pachymerus</hi> adds, that there were ſome in effect who let go theſe two Articles touching the Primacy, and Appeals, upon this Conſideration, that the Pope would have only the Name and Shadow of the thing, but never enjoy the thing it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>BUT in fine, we need not queſtion, but this Carriage of the Emperors, much encouraged and imboldned the <hi>Latins,</hi> to endeavour effectually to inſinuate their Opinions into the Minds of both Clergy and Laity, under pretence of inſtructing, and making them capable of this Union. We know what a Religious Zeal can do, and eſpecially when 'tis countenanced by Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſeconded by hopes of Succeſs. Had the <hi>Greek</hi> Church remained but ſome Years in this Condition, it might be ſaid, that theſe have bin but ſlight and tranſient Attempts, which have not had time to produce any great Effects. But 'tis certain that ſince the eleventh Century, which is to ſay, ſince the time <hi>Berengarius</hi> was laſt Condemned, till now, ſhe has bin continually as it were under the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke, and they have had all deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Opportunities to introduce their Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> and 'tis a kind of Miracle if they have not obtained their Ends. For when men have had to do with an ignorant and groſs People, in matters of Religion, as the <hi>Greeks</hi> are, and have bin for a long time, when Perſons have had a familiar and ordinary Commerce with them, and have beſides all proper means to prevail on them, as Power, Authority, Mildneſs, the way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, Fear, Hope, and moreover upheld by the Emperors, Patriarchs, and Biſhops; it is ſo far from being difficult to do what one will, that 'tis on the contrary very difficult not to do it. Whence it follows, that even when Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſhould make it appear that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration</hi> of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> have bin eſtabliſhed amongſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſince the eleventh Century, his Proofs would be uſeleſs and of no Conſequence, as
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41961:60"/> to our Debate; for it might always be anſwered, that this Doctrine hath bin communicated to them by the <hi>Latins,</hi> and the ways of this Communication are not hard to be underſtood. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has bin very ſenſible of the truth of what I ſay, and therefore was willing to relate, himſelf the greateſt part of theſe Hiſtorical Paſſages I mentioned: But he has otherwiſe repreſented them, to the end he might draw fruitleſs and impertinent Concluſions from them, and by this means hinder us from making a juſt and right uſe of them. This Deceit of his, is like to that he has us'd in the foregoing Chapter.</p>
                        <p>WE ſhall in the inſuing part of this Diſcourſe, overthrow his pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Conſequences. It may ſuffice at preſent to obſerve the Circuit he has taken, on purpoſe to divert his Reader from diſcovering the real Truth. For I do not believe there is any rational Man but will judge, that ſeeing theſe Doctrines appeared not in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, before theſe Diſorders; if they ſhould appear afterwards, they muſt be introduced by them. This is a natural and plain Concluſion.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s fourth Artifice conſiſts in concealing from us, the Care taken for ſeveral Ages, to fill <hi>Greece, Aſia, Egypt, Ethiopia,</hi> the <hi>Indias,</hi> and in a word, all the Countries wherein there's any People profeſſing Chriſtianity, with Religious, and other Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Perſons, ſent expreſly to plant the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, and even to eſtabliſh fixt Seminaries, who are charged to uſe their utmoſt Endeavours to Inſtruct and Reduce theſe Schiſmaticks. This Artifice of his, is not of ſmall Importance: for he thereby deprives us of the Knowledg of ſeveral Particulars; without which 'tis impoſſible to make a true and right Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Controverſie. And in truth we have reaſon to admire Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi>'s Ingenuity. For when there are any Hiſtorical Paſſages which ſeem to favour us, if they are ſo publickly known that 'twill be to no purpoſe to conceal them, he then produces them, but in ſo doing, applyes them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters, on purpoſe to make us loſe the Conſequence may be drawn from them: and on the other hand, if they are Paſſages leſs known, and that he may well conceal them; he then either not mentions them, or but lightly touches on them, to the end they may not be throughly conſidered. He has taken this laſt courſe in what concerns the Miſſions. Having prudently foreſeen that this Myſtery could not be handled without diſcovering at the ſame time the weakneſs and folly of his Proofs drawn from the Schiſmatical Churches; he has therefore thought good to make no mention of them, or
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41961:61"/> if at all, ſo ſlightly that they could ſcarcely be taken Notice of, leſt he ſhould be charged with diſcovering the Secret, and overthrowing himſelf, what he has taken upon him to defend. But ſeeing he has no reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his Silence ſhould ſet Bounds to mens Curioſity; and that they muſt know no more but what he tells them, ſo he muſt not take it ill, if I relate what he would have concealed.</p>
                        <p>I ſay then, that ſince the <hi>Latins</hi> Conquered the Holy Land, and made 'em ſelves Maſters of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire, all <hi>Greece</hi> and other <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Nations, have bin filled with Monks, or Emiſſaries, whoſe only deſign and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has bin to Inſinuate the Doctrines and Cuſtoms of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in thoſe Countries. Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> who commonly takes things in the worſt Sence, will be ſure to tell me I am to blame, in blaming this Deſign; Seeing it is an effect of that Zeal the <hi>Latins</hi> have ever ſhewed for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it being uſual with Perſons who are perſwaded of the Truth of their own Faith, to do all they can, to make Schiſmaticks, and Heretical People to Embrace the ſame. To which I anſwer, I do not at all blame the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, to win theſe People. Seeing ſhe believes they are in an Error, and therefore would undeceive them, and ſo far is Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly and Charitably done; but as to thoſe artificial Means the Emiſſaries uſe, which ſavour ſo much of worldy Policy, they are in no wiſe to be commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I do not, I ſay, blame them of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for labouring to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate their Faith; ſeeing they believe there is no Salvation out of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
                        <p>YET I cannot bear with Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> who knows full well, what the Monks and Emiſſaries have done, and do ſtill in the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> That he I ſay ſhould attempt to prove the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> of the Doctrines of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church by this Reaſon, That they are to be found eſtabliſhed amongſt theſe People. For ſeeing their Converſion has bin endeavoured time out of mind, no means ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving bin left untried to effect this; how then can it be affirmed that if at this Day they Believe Tranſubſtantiation, this Doctrine hath bin received by them, at the ſame time when Chriſtianity was firſt planted amongſt them? Who ſees not the Abſurdity of this Conſequence? Let the Buſineſs of the Emiſſaries be termed a Reduction, Inſtruction, Converſion, or what elſe he pleaſe? Yet would I by no means have Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> attempt the perſwading us, That if the <hi>Greeks</hi> and other Eaſtern Chriſtians, for whoſe ſake the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries have taken ſuch Pains, do believe <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> it thereupon follows that this Doctrine has bin ever held by thoſe Churches, for this is a way of Arguing, which will never prevail on rational Men. For any Mans Reaſon will tell him, that if theſe People believe <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> 'tis becauſe the Emiſſaries have taught it them, unleſs it be ſhewed that they held this Doctrine before they came amongſt them. And this is the Contents of this Chapter. The Conſequence I pretend to draw hence, is clear enough in it ſelf, and we need no more but only repreſent what I already hinted touching the Employment of the Monks, and Emiſſaries in the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>
                        <p>FIRST then, it is evident, that after the Conqueſt of the Holy Land, both <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi> were filled with Monks of every Order. Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> himſelf acknowledges it, and thereupon alledgeth the Teſtimony of <hi>James de Vitry,</hi> who tells us, <hi>that multitudes of People reſorted from all parts</hi>

                        <p>I ſhall not trouble my ſelf with mentioning the Miſſions of the <hi>Indias,</hi> nor them of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> for the relations of theſe are publick, and known by all the World. We may read what <hi>John Peter Maffeé</hi> and du <hi>Jaric,</hi> both <hi>Jeſuits</hi> have written in their Hiſtories of the <hi>Indias</hi> touching this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And likewiſe the Relations of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> taken out of the Letters writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the General of the Jeſuits <hi>Viteleſchy,</hi> and another Hiſtory of the <hi>Eaſt Indias</hi> Printed at <hi>Arras Anno</hi> 1628. but what I already mention'd is ſufficient to diſcover the fallacy of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Argument, who pretends to prove the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> of his Faith from the Teſtimony of the Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Churches. For now after what I repreſented, all which has been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully tranſcribed out of Authors never ſuſpected by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> what aſſurance can we have if the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, be found eſtabliſhed amongſt theſe people, that it has not been communicated to them by all theſe Emiſſaries, who have been ſent for ſo many years, for no other purpoſe? It ought, methinks, to be ſhewed us (to colour over this proof) that the ſources whence they drew their Chriſtianity have not been adulterated, that theſe Springs have run clear, without being troubled to this day; or at leaſt the time of theſe Miſſions muſt be laid aſide, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> (if he intends to deal ſincerely) muſt begin from the Ages which precede them; for if it does not appear theſe Schiſmaticks believed the ſame as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> concerning the Euchariſt, before all this care for their inſtruction, what likelihood is there we ſhall ſuffer our ſelves to be ſurpriz'd by ſo frivolous an Argument. I will ſuppoſe for once that I was deceiv'd, when I maintain'd that any one of theſe Nations who profeſs the Chriſtian Religion and ſubmitted not to the Pope, did not reckon Tranſubſtantiation amongſt the Articles of their Creed, nor the Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Euchariſt amongſt their Rites and Ceremonies. Will Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> then imagine that my miſtake has prejudiced my Cauſe, or juſtified the Conſequence he pretends to draw from his Principle? This pretenſion of his in my mind, would be very unjuſt and unreaſonable. For whether the Greeks and other Eaſtern Chriſtians, do or do not believe Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, this is only a queſtion between him and me, to which the Subject I defend has no relation, and therefore he can expect no more at utmoſt than a Victory over me and not my Cauſe, ſeeing the Conſequence he would draw hence will be continually diſputed him, to wit, that Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation has been perpetually believed in theſe Churches. Whence it follows that he has been to blame in paſſing over ſo ſlightly as he has done, a point of this importance, on which depends the whole force of his Proofs, and he may juſtly be complain'd of in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in that he hath in his whole proceeding betrayed a greater care for his own private Reputation, than that of the Church whoſe cauſe he takes upon him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend. As to what concerns my ſelf I hope I ſhall be able to give the World a good Account touching what I denyed: and were I miſtaken, I would not be aſhamed to make an open Recantation without the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion that this my Retractation would in any ſort prejudice my Cauſe, ſeeing in effect, I do not believe it follows that a Doctrine has been perpetual
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41961:64"/> in Religion, altho Schiſmatical Churches now profeſs it as well as the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins. This Conſequence muſt be proved, as well as its Principle, did Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> take a direct courſe and argue in a requiſite manner to ſatisfie judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſons. And therefore he ought to have given a ſincere account of this whole Hiſtory of the <hi>Miſſions,</hi> which I come now from repreſenting in this Chap. for I cannot imagine how <hi>Mr. Arnaud</hi> could paſs over in ſilence as he has done, an Hiſtory ſo important and neceſſary for the making of a right Judgment of this whole Controverſie; ſeeing he could not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of it. If he believes he has done right, I muſt needs ſay, he has a kind of ſincerity different from that of all other people; and if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves he ought not to have taken this courſe, we muſt affirm, that his ſilence is ſo much the more criminal, in that he has acted againſt the light of his own Conſcience.</p>

                           <p>That the means the <hi>Emiſſaries</hi> have uſed for the introducing of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Religion amongst the <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> The <hi>Seminaries</hi> which have been ſet up for the ſame deſign, and the particular Inſtructions given them touching the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, do ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew that there can no Advantage accrue to Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> by their belief. Mr. <hi>Arnaud's</hi> fifth Artifice diſcovered.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>WHOSOEVER conſiders the foregoing Chapters will not I ſuppoſe overmuch value <hi>Mr. Arnaud</hi>'s Labours touching the Grecian and other Eaſtern Chriſtians called <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi> For 'tis certain there was never a more vain and fruitleſs Amuſement, than his whole Diſpute on that Subject; at the end whereof I am much miſtaken if he finds not he has ill beſtowed his time, having given no light at all to the main Queſtion, which is to know whether the Doctrine of the preſent Roman Church is the ſame with that of all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. But beſides what I already offered, it remains, that I make ſome important Reflections on thoſe things, the moſt part of which <hi>Mr. Arnaud</hi> has paſt over in ſilence, and which I ſhall recollect as briefly as I can in this Chapter, to the end I may not any longer detain the Reader on a point, which I believe I have ſufficiently evidenced.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Then I find in the Relation of the Emiſſaries of St. <hi>Erinys,</hi> that one of the reaſons for which they were ſent, was to endeavour the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the honour of the Holy Sacrament. The Author of theſe Relations deſirous to give the World an account of the Honours they have endeavoured to procure from the Inhabitants of this Iſland, to the Sacrament, begins thus, <hi>I believe,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>the Gentlemen of</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">C. 20. P. 304.</note> 
                           <hi>the Confraternity of the Auguſt Society of the Holy Sacrament, having teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41961:65"/> ſo great Zeal for the Advancement of this Devotion, eſpecially in the Eaſtern Countries, will approve of theſe Diſcourſes, ſeeing they will be inform'd by them that the Prayers and Vows they have made for the Converſion of theſe poor wretches, were not fruitleſs.</hi> Theſe words ſufficiently ſhew (if I be not miſtaken,) that one of the chief ends which the Emiſſaries propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to themſelves in the Converſion of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> is to give them thoſe Sentiments which they have not yet entertained concerning the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and 'tis unto this whereunto tends the Zeal and Prayers of the Confraternity.</p>
                        <p>WHENCE it follows, that 'tis no great wonder if they have accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Deſign; and that if theſe people do at this day believe Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation and Adore the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> it cannot be hence concluded that this Doctrine has been amongſt them ever ſince they firſt received the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
                        <p>BUT the better to convince Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> of the vanity of his pretended Conſequence, and how little I would eſteem his victory if it were as real as it is falſe and imaginary; I need but ſet before him the means theſe Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have uſed whereby to inſinuate the Roman Religion, in theſe Countries, in all which I ſhall relate no more than what I learn from Authors no wiſe ſuſpected by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                        <p>NOW tell me, I pray after this, with what ſincerity the <hi>Greeks</hi> and other <hi>Eaſtern Chriſtians</hi> can be alledged in this matter? they are won by Money, ſeveral pretences are made uſe of by the Emiſſaries to introduce themſelves into their houſes, they prevail on their Biſhops, not making them publickly change their Religion, but leaving them in the ſame Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherein they find them, to the end that they may likewiſe endeavour the Eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith. Now what can be ſaid of theſe people, but that if they believe Tranſubſtantiation (it not appearing they believed it before all theſe Intrigues) they have received this Doctrine from the Emiſſaries, by theſe indirect ways which they practiſe.</p>
                        <p>BUT this is not all, for one of the moſt uſual and effectual Courſes they take to eſtabliſh inſenſibly, and without any noiſe, the Roman Religion in <hi>Greece,</hi> and amongſt all other Nations, is the inſtruction of their Youth, which employment they commonly take upon them whereſoever they come; for under pretence of inſtructing them in Human Learning, they inſtil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their minds the Principles of the Romiſh Faith, ſo that a great part of the <hi>Greek Prelates</hi> are of this number, that is to ſay their Schollars, having received from them in their tender Age a favourable Opinion of the Roman Church.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>IT already appears, by theſe Teſtimonies, that one of the principal things recommended to the Emiſſaries, when they are to be ſent abroad, is the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation of Children, as an infallible means to ſet up the Romiſh Religion in the midſt of theſe people, and that the Emiſſaries on their ſide do well acquit themſelves in this particular. But the Author of the Book called <hi>A Deſcription of the Holy Land,</hi> delivers himſelf more plainly. For diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing how the Jeſuits employ themſelves in the City of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> he tells us, that their chief buſineſs is to inſtruct Youth, which has always been eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a matter of great importance and highly conducing to the reformation of theſe Nations. Obſerve, I beſeech you, what he ſays, that the Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do not only carefully apply themſelves to this, and that by order from their Superiors, but that this is an eſpecial means to make all theſe people in a ſhort time to become inſenſibly Roman <hi>Catholicks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT we muſt likewiſe take notice that theſe Gentlemen who leave no means untryed, do wholly betake themſelves to theſe two laſt ways, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that of gaining the Prelates and that of inſtructing Youth. For when they have won any Biſhop to their Party, they oblige him to ſet them upon the educating of their Children, making uſe of his Authority that they may manage their buſineſs with greater ſucceſs and ſecurity. Which the ſame Author of the <hi>Holy Land</hi> ſhews us, <hi>Father Queriot,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>was a fit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to offer his ſervice to the Greek Metropolitain, who was a good Catholick,</hi>

                        <p>SPEAKING of the Miſſion of <hi>Damaſcus, this Miſſion,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>is the work of Father</hi> Jerom Queriot <hi>who was ſent from</hi> Aleppo <hi>to</hi> Damaſcus, <hi>in the beginning of the year 1643, by the Greek Patriarch</hi> Euthymius, <hi>who was of the Iſle of</hi> Chios, <hi>and of the Romiſh Religion, for the inſtruction of Youth, and eſpecially of his Nephew, and for the compoſition of his circular Letters and Greek and Arabian Patents.</hi> Yet he tells us, <hi>this Father was forc'd to leave</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>I cannot forbear mentioning what the ſaid Author relates on the ſame Subject, namely, the inſtruction of the Greek Youth. <hi>We muſt betake our ſelves to this Courſe,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>for the converting the Greek Schiſmaticks. We are too old, ſaid</hi> Jeraſimus <hi>an Archbiſhop and Vicar of the Patriarchate, to receive new Impreſſions: but inſtruct our Youth, who by your care will be capable of trying good things and prove a Seminary of perfect Chriſtians; words,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>which he uttered in the hearing of the Youth on purpoſe to encourage them to make uſe of the advantage offered them. It is certainly a great ſatisfaction to us when we ſee young Greeks who are naturally eloquent, to inſtruct ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely their Servants; and I had almoſt ſaid, even their very Parents, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as it were their Diſciples in Religion. Is there any thing more great and glorious than the building of new Churches with the Apoſtles, and converting the World? For new Churches are planted by the ſettlement of theſe</hi> Miſſions, <hi>and the old ones repaired at the ſame time, by means of the Inſtruction of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren who teach their Parents.</hi> This Jeſuit lays open the matter plainly and ſincerely, whereas Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does not ſo, for he would have theſe new Churches paſs for old ones.</p>
                        <p>THE ſame Author relates that having obſerv'd <hi>John Damaſcen</hi> was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd in this Country as an infallible Doctor, and that his Teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Hereſies was of great weight with them; <hi>One of our Fathers,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>undertook to teach this Saints Logick and Divinity touching the controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Points.</hi> He ſay's, <hi>this invention took, and inſpired the Schollars with great Zeal.</hi> But ſay's he, <hi>this their forwardneſs was taken notice of by ſome envious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who informed the Vicar of the Patriarchate of the matter, and ſo far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed him that he caus'd the young Students to be brought before him, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reprehended their Boldneſs, condemned their Opinions and charged them to deſiſt from ſuch Diſcourſes, adding therewithal, that if they obeyed not his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, he would ruine them and their Families. Theſe Arguments, ſay's he, could not prevail with the Schollars to change their Opinions, or break off their Aſſemblies, and forſake their Maſters, but they were more cautious afterwards, and did forbear publiſhing any thing in the Circles as they had heretofore done.</hi>

They have therefore very adviſedly, ſet up Schools, whereunto the Children of Schiſmaticks and ſometimes of Turks too do reſort. The deſire of having ſome Images, or Agnuſſes draws them to our Congregations, where hearing our Doctrine, they become effectually Catholicks without perceiving themſelves to be ſo: as for the other Schiſmaticks, they hear our Sermons, and pretend to be Catholicks only in hope of ſome Advantage they expect by this their Diſſimulation.</hi>

                        <p>AS to what remains we muſt not imagine the <hi>Turks,</hi> under whoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment the <hi>Greeks</hi> live, do hinder the Endeavours of the <hi>Latins; it was never heard of,</hi> ſay's <hi>John Cottovicus, that the</hi> Turks <hi>have been in any ſort ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere againſt the Religious, who having finiſhed their Studies at</hi> Rome, <hi>and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Orders, returned into their own Countrys and were raiſed to Dignities, nor that the Turkiſh Magiſtrate hath upon this account made them ſuffer the leaſt Dammage.</hi> In effect provided they oppoſe not their Religion, they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy enough to connive at all other matters. They favour them that give 'em moſt Money, and from thence 'tis we ſee on the Patriarchal <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> Perſons who keep a good Correſpondency with the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> or elſe ſuch who have been the Jeſuits Schollars, who feeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves rais'd to this Dignity, do not fail to favour, as much as in them lies, this change ſo long proſecuted: and 'tis in this rank we muſt place <hi>Raphael, Neophytus, Timotheus, Cyrillus</hi> of <hi>Berrhaea,</hi> and I know not how many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whom the <hi>Roman</hi> Party has at divers times helped to the Patriarchate, and who in requital did them afterwards great Service.</p>
                        <p>ALL this, me thinks, ſhews evidently that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has been very diſ-ingenuous in his whole proceeding, who concealing theſe <hi>Intrigues,</hi> confidently undertakes to convince us, of the Antiquity of the <hi>Roman</hi> Creed touching the Euchariſt, upon this Principle, that this ſame Doctrine is held by other Chriſtian Churches, as if all the paſſages from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Greece</hi> were ſo blocked up that theſe Doctrines could never be tranſported thither, or as if the <hi>Latins</hi> had never attempted this. Had theſe People received theſe Doctrines elſewhere, or invented them themſelves; Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would have ſome pretence for his Argument; neither could we then charge him with aſſerting things as we do now againſt the light of his own Conſcience: But ſeeing he knew well enough, the <hi>Latins</hi> have been perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually endeavouring to introduce their Doctrines in theſe Countrys, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly laboured at this, ſince I know not how many Ages; he therefore upon ſuppoſal they have effected this, comes and offers us the belief of theſe People as an undoubted Proof of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> of this Doctrine, this is, to ſpeak modeſtly, ſuch a way of proceeding as will never be approved by juſt and reaſonable men.</p>
                        <p>IT will perhaps be objected, that I do indeed here ſhew, That the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi> endeavour'd to inſinuate their Religion in the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> but that I do not make it particularly appear, they at any time endeavoured to introduce their Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation. To which I anſwer firſt, this is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; for propoſing only to my ſelf at preſent, to ſhew the Nullity of the Conſequence Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> pretends to draw in order to the proving of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Creed, touching Tranſubſtantiation, in that he imagines the Eaſtern Churches hold the ſame, it ſuffices me to ſhew there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, That this Opinion might be communicated to them by the <hi>Latins</hi> themſelves, in their ſeveral attempts to introduce their Religion into the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> eſpecially conſidering that Tranſubſtantiation is one of the moſt important Doctrines of it. And if Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would have his Proof ſubſiſt, he muſt ſet aſide all the time of theſe efforts we now mentioned, and betake himſelf only to thoſe Ages which preceded them. For unleſs he proves, that Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation has been believed in theſe Churches, before all theſe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41961:69"/> to bring them over to the Roman Faith, there is no Perſon endued with ſence, but will perceive how little ſtrength his Argument carries along with it, ſeeing he is ever lyable to be told, they have received it from the <hi>Latins,</hi> it not appearing amongſt them before.</p>
                        <p>BUT in the ſecond place, I will not have it ſtick here, to the end Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> may receive full ſatisfaction touching this point. I ſay then, that in the Year 1627. <hi>Clement</hi> the Fourth intending to make his Advantage of that <note place="margin">Raynald. ad ann. 1267. num. 75.</note> great Earneſtneſs <hi>Michael Paleologus</hi> ſhewed for the Reunion of his Church with the <hi>Roman</hi> (as it has been obſerved in the third Chap. of this Book) he thereupon ſent him a Confeſſion of Faith, which he would have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> becauſe he found that which the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſent him, not only deficient in ſeveral things, but full of Errors, altho the Fryar <hi>Minorites</hi> then at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> had accepted it. Now Amongſt other Articles in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion there is one, which relates to the Euchariſt, and which runs thus in Latin. <hi>Sacramentum Euchariſtae ex azymo conficit eadem</hi> Romana <hi>Eccleſia, tenens &amp; docens quod in ipſo Sacramento panis verè tranſubſtantiatur in Corpus, &amp; Vinum in Sanguinem Domini noſtri</hi> Jeſu Chriſti, which is to ſay, <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>Celebrates the Sacrament of the Euchariſt with unleavened Bread, Believing and Teaching that in this Sacrament the Bread is really tranſubſtantiated into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the Wine into the Blood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He ſent afterwards Dominicains to Confirm this Confeſſion and procure its acceptance with the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IN the Year 1272, <hi>Gregory</hi> the Tenth ſent Fryar <hi>Minorites</hi> into <hi>Greece,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Raynald. ad ann. 1272. num. 27.</note> to endeavour afreſh the Reduction of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> under the Authority of the ſame <hi>Michael Paleologus,</hi> who reſolved to finiſh this Affair at any rate, and to whom he likewiſe recommended the ſame Confeſſion of Faith.</p>
                        <p>IN the Year 1288. Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Fourth ſent Fryar <hi>Minorites</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Idem ad ann. 1288. num. 30.</note> 
                           <hi>Eſclavonia,</hi> to bring off theſe People from the Greek Religion to that of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> he gave them Letters to King <hi>Uroſius,</hi> and <hi>Helena</hi> the Queen Mother; and recommended to 'em the ſame Form of Doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Article of Tranſubſtantiation, to the end this might be the Rule of their inſtructions to the People.</p>
                        <p>THE ſame Pope ſent it likewiſe to three Biſhops in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> who embraced his Communion, exhorting them to inſtruct the People accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Ibid. num. 33.</note> to the Doctrine contained therein, and at the ſame time he recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them the Emiſſaries ſent into thoſe Countries, for the Converſion of the <hi>Greeks, Bulgarians, Valaquians, Syrians, Iberians, Alains, Ruſſians, Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, Neſtorians, Georgians, Armenians, Indians;</hi> whence it is eaſie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that the Emiſſaries were likewiſe enjoyned to uſe this Formulary.</p>
                        <p>IN the Year 1318. Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the twenty Second ſent this Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Raynald. ad ann. 1318. num. 13.</note> to the King of <hi>Armenia; And not only,</hi> ſay's <hi>Rynaldus, The Armenians which inhabited</hi> Cilicia, <hi>and</hi> Armenia <hi>embraced the Doctrine of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church: but others alſo who being driven out of their Country by the</hi> Sarracens, <hi>had retired into</hi> Cherſoneſus Taurique. <hi>They ſubmitted themſelves to the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Church, in the preſence of the Biſhop of</hi> Capha, <hi>who was a Latin. The Pope,</hi> adds he, <hi>congratulated them, and ſhewed 'em, that</hi> in the Divine Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the Subſtance <hi>of Bread is changed into the Body and Blood of Chriſt, the Species remaining entire.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="107" facs="tcp:41961:69"/>
                        <p>IN the Year 1338. <hi>Bennet</hi> the Twelfth received Letters from the <hi>Alains,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Idem ad ann. 1338. num. 77.</note> who were a ſort of Chriſtians, that profeſſed the Greek Religion, and lived under the Government of the <hi>Tartars.</hi> He return'd them an anſwer, and ſent the Confeſſion of Faith I already mention'd for their Inſtruction. <hi>Raynaldus</hi> referrs this Letter to the Year 1338. But there is an old Book I late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cited intitled <hi>The marvelous Hiſtory of the great Cham of Tartaria,</hi> which referrs this to the Year 1328. The Article of Tranſubſtantiation is expreſly mentioned in it.</p>
                        <p>IN the Year 1366. <hi>John Paleologus</hi> the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperor deſigning to <note place="margin">Idem ad ann. 1366. num. 6.</note> reunite himſelf to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he might be aſſiſted againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> Pope <hi>Urbain</hi> the Fifth ſent him, as his Predeceſſors had done to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> this ſame Confeſſion of Faith.</p>
                        <p>SO that here then the <hi>Latins</hi> are not only enjoyned to propagate their Religion in general amongſt the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Chriſtians, but particularly the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, and to the end it may not be ſaid this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion contains the other Points of the Chriſtian Faith, as well as that of the <hi>Subſtantial Converſion,</hi> it is to be obſerved, that it has two diſtinct parts: in the firſt of which the Articles of the Apoſtles Creed are explained, and in the other there are ſeveral particular points expreſly determined by the Church of <hi>Rome, propter diverſas Haereſes a quibuſdam ex ignorantia &amp; ab aliis ex malitia introductas, by reaſon of certain Hereſies introduc'd by the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of ſome, and Malice of others.</hi> Now 'tis under theſe laſt points that the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation is contained; which plainly ſhews, that this Doctrine was propoſed to them as lately defined by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of which thoſe People had at that time no certain Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> then muſt ſeek elſewhere for Proofs whereon to ground his pretenſion touching the Antiquity of the Opinion in queſtion, and I will not ſtick to affirm, he muſt be an extraordinary Perſon if he can ſolidly acquit himſelf of what I have lay'd before him, and in all which I defie him to produce a falſe Quotation. He has been ſhewed five remarkable deceits whereby he has impoſed on the World, in concealing whatſoever was neceſſary to be known in order to a right underſtanding of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, and in turning to a vain and unprofitable uſe whatſoever concludes directly againſt him. He has been ſhewed the profound Ignorance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe People have lay'n from the eleventh Century to this preſent, and the fond Superſtitions reigning amongſt them, which makes them very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit Judges of our Controverſie. He has been ſhewed the miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe Churches in reſpect of Temporals, and the Violences offered them by the <hi>Latins</hi> to make them change their Religion. We have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him with the Perſecutions they ſuffered from their own Princes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account; We have obſerved all theſe Countries ore-ſpread with Monks and Emiſſaries, time out of mind, and that without interruption to this day; We have repreſented him with a particular account of what the Emiſſaries do, and what the Seminaries contribute towards the making them receive the Roman Faith. And in fine, we have ſhewed him, that one of their chiefeſt cares for theſe People was to make them learn the Myſtery of the <hi>Subſtantial Converſion.</hi> Now after this, whether they do believe it, or not, it is an indifferent matter in reſpect of the main
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41961:70"/> of our Controverſie. So that it only now lies upon me to vindicate my own particular Reputation; that is to ſay, whether I have rightly or no affirmed that they do not believe it, and which I ſhall demonſtrate by God's Aſſiſtance in the following parts of this Work, and that in ſuch a manner as I doubt not but will ſatisfie all reaſonable Perſons.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>The Question stated, and M. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s ſixth Deceit manifested.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IT may be remembred, that at the beginning of this Diſpute touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Schiſmatical Churches, I undertook to prove the truth of of theſe three Propoſitions. Firſt, that when Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſhall prove what he pretends concerning theſe Churches, ſince the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Century to this preſent, yet will it not thence follow that the Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, touching the Euchariſt has been perpetual in the Chriſtian Religion, or the change in queſtion impoſſible, or that it hath not actually hapned. Secondly, That the true Greek Church and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which the <hi>Latins</hi> call Schiſmaticks, never reckoned Tranſubſtantiation amongſt the Articles of their Belief, nor the Adoration of the Euchariſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt their Rites and Ceremonies. Thirdly, That whatſoever Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has offered to prove the Affirmative, is void and ineffectual, and that even the greateſt part of his Proofs conclude the contrary of that which he pretends. I have already made good the firſt of theſe Propoſitions in the preceding Book, and ſhall in this inquire into the belief of the Greeks from the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Century to this preſent; that I may thereby accommodate my ſelf to Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Method. And as to the other Greek Churches, I ſhall treat of them in my fifth Book. But it is firſt neceſſary to lay down the true State of the Queſtion, to the end, that what we undertake may be the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Deceit more plainly detected. Who continually wanders from the point in diſpute, ſuppoſing impoſſibilities, proving imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencies and confounding what ought to be diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                        <p>WE muſt know then there are two ſorts of Greeks, the one reunited to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who acknowledge the Popes Juriſdiction, and receive the Decrees of the <hi>Florentine</hi> Council, living in Peace with the <hi>Latins;</hi> The other acknowledge only their own Patriarchs, having their Communion apart, and ſeparate from the <hi>Latins.</hi> And this I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> or his Friends will not deny, ſeeing that in their Obſervations on the Requeſt of M. the Archbiſhop of <hi>Ambrun</hi> they have themſelves made this diſtinction <hi>of the Greek Catholick Church, and the Greek Schiſmatical one.</hi> It is needleſs to alledge other Proofs touching a matter of Fact ſo well known. In effect the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the <hi>Latins</hi> to ſubject the <hi>Greeks</hi> to themſelves have not been wholly fruitleſs, for beſides that in <hi>Greece</hi> it ſelf and other <hi>Patriarchates,</hi> they have
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41961:71"/> acquired a great number of Perſons and intire Families, beſides this I ſay, there are whole Nations which obſerve the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> and live under the Juriſdiction of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> who yet ſtill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Rites and Cuſtoms of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> We may place in this rank all the <hi>Greeks</hi> in <hi>Italy, Rome, Venice, Tuſcany,</hi> the Kingdoms of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> which are called <hi>Italian Greeks,</hi> we may alſo bring under this Rank a great part of them who live under the Government of the <hi>Venetians.</hi> For <hi>Allatius</hi> teſtifies, that not only all theſe do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſame Ceremonies as them of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> but that the Pope likewiſe obliges them to an Obſervance of them, and therefore maintains a <hi>Greek</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop to confer Orders according to the <hi>Greek</hi> Mode, to hinder 'em from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving them in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> from the hands of Schiſmaticks. We muſt likewiſe comprehend the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> which inhabit black <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> and <hi>Podolia,</hi> under the Government of the King of <hi>Poland;</hi> who ſubmitted themſelves to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> towards the end of the laſt Century. <hi>Arcudius</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> the Third, for that he did not only ſollicite but in a manner <note place="margin">Arcud. Epist. ad Sigiſmond.</note> conſtrain them to make this Union, <hi>ut ad Romanam,</hi> ſays he, <hi>hoc eſt ver am Dei Eccleſiam ſe adjungerent excitaſti ac pene dixerim impuliſti.</hi> Our Queſtion does not concern them, their Submiſſion to the <hi>Roman</hi> See evidently excludes them from this Diſpute, I expreſly excepted them, when I denyed that the <hi>Greeks</hi> and other Chriſtians held Tranſubſtantiation, and Adored the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, having ſaid in plain terms, <hi>except thoſe that ſubmit themſelves to the Pope.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>SECONDLY, We muſt remember that one of the chief Advantages <note place="margin">Anſwer to the firſt Treatiſe towards the end.</note> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> makes of theſe forementioned Seminaries, and Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in <hi>Greece,</hi> is the gaining of Proſelytes and inſtructing young People in its Doctrines, to uſe them afterwards for the Converſion of others, as I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the preceding Book. Now <hi>Mr, Arnaud</hi> cannot in reaſon bring theſe ſort of People into the reckoning, and I think it will not be taken ill, If I ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate them from the reſt, for in effect the Abuſe would be too groſs to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to determine this Queſtion touching the Greek Church, by the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Converts, or Perſons brought up from their Infancy amongſt the Jeſuits and other Religious Orders and Latin Doctors, who inſtructed them in their Doctrines; and I have already ſhewn, that the number of theſe is not ſmall, and <hi>Allatius</hi> himſelf aſſures us of it. <hi>The Greeks,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>that reverence the Pope and receive his Decrees as Oracles are more in number than we</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Allat. de perp. conſ. lib. 3. cap. 11.</note> 
                           <hi>imagine, and were they not with held by the fear of a moſt cruel Tyrant, and that of the Calumnies and Accuſations of ſome wicked People, we ſhould ſee every day, them who poſſeſs the greateſt Dignities amongſt the Greeks, come and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate themſelves at the Popes Foot-ſtool.</hi> This is the Fruit of the <hi>Miſſions</hi> and <hi>Seminaries.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IN the third place, the Queſtion is not here, whether the <hi>Greeks</hi> have the ſame Opinion with us concerning the Sacrament? This is Mr. <hi>Arnauds</hi> continual device to diſpute on this Principle, to wit, that I affirm the <hi>Greeks</hi> to be of the ſame Opinion with us. As for example, he takes a great deal <note place="margin">Lib. 2. C. 12.</note> of pains to ſhew that 'tis not likely we would make uſe of <hi>Euthymius</hi> his words to inſtruct a man in our Doctrine, and that <hi>Euthymius</hi> has not taken the term <hi>Eſt,</hi> in our Saviour's words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> in the ſence of <hi>Significat.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 2. C. 13.</note> He likewiſe takes a great deal of pains to prove that <hi>Nicholas Méthonienſis</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 2. C. 15.</note> was not a <hi>Berengarian</hi> and one that believed the Bread was the Figure of our Saviour's Body, that the Profeſſion of Faith which the <hi>Saracens</hi> were cauſed to make when they embraced the Chriſtian Religion, was not in ſuch terms as to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41961:71"/> make them underſtand that the Bread and Wine were not really our Saviour's Body, but only the Figure or Repreſentation thereof indued with its Virtue, and that Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third did not reproach <note place="margin">Lib. 3. C. 1.</note> the <hi>Greeks</hi> with their believing that they eat only the Figure of Chriſt's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. All this is but a mere Artifice to impoſe on the World, and blind thoſe that have not continually the point in queſtion in their minds; and ſuffer themſelves to be eaſily carried off from one Subject to another. I ſay then it concerns us not to know, whether the belief of the <hi>Greeks</hi> touching the Euchariſt, is the ſame in every particular with that of ours, and whether they explain themſelves on that Subject in the ſame manner as we do. This we never yet affirmed to Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> but the contrary, <hi>viz, That ſeveral</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Anſwer to the firſt Treatiſe.</note> 
                           <hi>of the Greeks have ſince the ſeventh Century rejected the terms of Figure, Image, and Type, which the Ancients made uſe of and we uſe after their example.</hi> The preſent Queſtion is, whether the <hi>Greeks</hi> do believe concerning the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth, this is the only point of the Diſpute, to which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ought to have ſtuck, and not to wander into wide Diſcourſes and fruitleſs Conſequences. In effect the deſign of the Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> being to make us confeſs, <hi>that the belief of the Church of</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Firſt Treatiſe of the Perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.</note> Rome <hi>touching the Euchariſt, has been perpetual in all Ages,</hi> and that Author having for this purpoſe made uſe of the Conformity of the <hi>Greeks</hi> with her in this Point, and this Conformity having been denyed, it is clear, that the Queſtion does not concern our Sentiment, but that of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, to know whether the <hi>Greeks</hi> hold and teach the ſame thing.</p>
                        <p>IN the fourth place, our Diſpute hitherto has not been concerning the <hi>real Preſence,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſuppoſes, but only on the Subject of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, and the Adoration thereon appendant; ſo that he has dealt very diſ-ingeniouſly, in making the World believe that our debate reached to the <hi>Real Preſence: Our Queſtion,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>is concerning the belief of all theſe</hi>

                           <hi>Treatiſe diſcourſed of the Real preſence, and contented himſelf with maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this Doctrine was received by all theſe Schiſmatical Churches; yet Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>has continually turn'd the Queſtion upon Tranſubſtantiation, which was not the point preciſely in queſtion.</hi> But in fine, 'tis the effect of a moſt unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <note place="margin">Lib. 2. C. 10. P. 191.</note> Liberty to write, <hi>that he knows not whether the boldneſs of a man can proceed to that point where mine muſt needs be, in maintaining to the end that the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Tranſubſtantiation are Doctrines unknown to the Greek Church.</hi> And I dare to affirm that his cannot be greater than it is, for 'tis certain, that here the Queſtion only concerns Tranſubſtantiation and the Adoration, and not the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Preſence, concerning which I have not yet ſaid any thing. 1. Let Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> read the laſt Section of my firſt Anſwer, and he will find preciſely theſe words; <hi>I affirm that Tranſubſtantiation and the Adoration of the Sacrament, are two things unknown to all the World, the</hi> Roman <hi>Church excepted; for neither the</hi> Greeks, <hi>nor the</hi> Armenians, Ruſſians, Jacobites, Ethiopians, <hi>nor in general any Chriſtians but them who have ſubmitted themſelves to the Pope, do believe any thing touching theſe two Articles.</hi> 2. Let the paſſages of my ſecond An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer be peruſed where I handle again the ſame Queſtion, and it will be found that they only concern Tranſubſtantiation, there being no mention therein of the Real Preſence. 3. I deſire the Reader to peruſe the laſt Chapter of the ſecond Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> and he will find it contains theſe words
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41961:72"/> for its Title. <hi>That all the Sects ſeparate from the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>are at accord with her, in the point of Tranſubſtantiation, and eſpecially the Greeks.</hi> He will find likewiſe that in the body of the Chapter there is not a word of the Real Preſence.</p>
                        <p>THERE is no body then but Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> who has thought of bringing it into our debate, and this without any other reaſon but that he will have it ſo, maugre us, imagining he ſhall be able to ſave himſelf by the Ambiguity of the term of Real Preſence. For as to what he tells us, that the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> ſpeaks only in his firſt Treatiſe of the Real Preſence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents himſelf with aſſerting That this Doctrine was received by all the Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Churches, I am ſorry I muſt tell him that I know not any man that writes things on ſuch ſlight grounds as he does; nor ſo eaſily expoſes his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in aſſerting matters of Fact, of whoſe untruth he is lyable to be convinced by every one that can read. For not to go farther we need but read, to find in the fourteenth Page of the firſt Treatiſe, that the Author propoſes to himſelf, <hi>to make any man confeſs who is not extreamly obſtinate by the evidence of truth it ſelf, that the belief of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>touching this Myſtery is the ſame with that of all Antiquity.</hi> Now every body knows that the belief of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> reaches as far as Tranſubſtantiation. We need but read moreover for this purpoſe the eighteenth and nineteenth Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the firſt Treatiſe, wherein the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſhew us the univerſality of the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> tells us, <hi>that</hi> Lanfranc <hi>having explained the Catholick Doctrine in theſe terms; We believe the Terreſtial Subſtances of Bread and Wine being divinely Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied on our Lord</hi>'s <hi>Table by the Miniſtry of the Prieſts, are</hi> CHANGED <hi>by</hi> 
                           <q>
                              <hi>the ineffable Operation, wonderful and incomprehenſible Power of God into the Eſſence of the Body of our Lord,</hi> adds farther, <hi>Behold here the Faith which the Church diſperſed throughout the whole World, which is called Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, has held in all Ages and does at this time hold, and that he confidently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats this in the twenty ſecond Chapter, and preſſes</hi> Berengarius <hi>to inform himſelf of the Sentiments of all the Chriſtians in the World in the</hi> Eaſt <hi>and</hi> Weſt. <hi>Ask the</hi> Greeks, Armenians, <hi>and generally all Chriſtians of what Nation</hi>
                           </q> 
                           <hi>ſoever, and they will all of them tell you they hold the ſame Faith which we profeſs.</hi> We need but only read to be ſatisfied that the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces afterwards the Teſtimony of <hi>Guitmond</hi> in the ſame Sence, and for the ſame end he cited that of <hi>Lanfranc,</hi> to wit, to prove that the <hi>Greeks</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Schiſmaticks do believe Tranſubſtantiation, and that in the twenty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Page he makes this remark, <hi>That</hi> Guitmond <hi>does not only apply what he ſay's to the Opinion which is contrary to the Real Preſence, but likewiſe to the Doctrine</hi> of the impanation which is that of <hi>the Lutherans,</hi> which clearly ſhews us, that this Teſtimony of <hi>Guitmond</hi> reſpects not only the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but likewiſe Tranſubſtantiation. In fine, to be aſcertained in this matter we need but read what the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> immediately adds in his twenty third Page, after he had alledged that paſſage of <hi>Guit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond: All the Books of the Schiſmatical Greeks,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>which have come to our hands ſince that time, do clearly teſtifie they held the ſame Opinions as the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>touching the Euchariſt.</hi> After this Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> comes and tells us, <hi>that although the Author of the Perpetuity ſpeaks only in his firſt Treatiſe of the Real Preſence, and contents himſelf with aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this Doctrine was held by all theſe Schiſmatical Churches, Yet Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>turns aſide the Queſtion upon Tranſubſtantion, which Point this Author does not preciſely Treat of.</hi> What means then I pray theſe Quotations out of <hi>Lanfranc</hi>
                           <pb n="113" facs="tcp:41961:72"/> and <hi>Guitmond</hi> which he has expreſly produc'd to ſhew that Tranſubſtantiation was believed by the whole World, both by the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Armenians,</hi> and generally by all Chriſtians? Certainly Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does himſelf an irrepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Injury thus to maintain things without conſulting and examining them, flattering himſelf with the hopes of being believed upon his own bare word. That which has deceiv'd him without doubt has been this: That he has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> that the Author having produced his Argument touching the Schiſmatical Churches in the manner already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, that is to ſay poſitively, in reference to Tranſubſtantiation, paſſing afterwards to the propoſing of ſome Arguments; by which he pretends to ſhew that the Myſtery of the Euchariſt is diſtinctly known by all the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and that an inſenſible change is a thing impoſſible, he reſtrains himſelf to the Real Preſence, but there is a difference betwixt theſe two points, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ought to have conſidered this a little better. I ſay then, that in this Diſpute of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and other Chriſtians ſeparated from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, the queſtion concerns Tranſubſtantiation, and not the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, as well for that the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> has expreſly mentioned Tranſubſtantiation in his firſt Treatiſe as I come now from obſerving, and for as much as I plainly kept my ſelf in my firſt Anſwer to this Doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and that of the Adoration, whereupon it follows that the Debate has been preciſely continued on theſe two Articles. Yet do I here declare, to avoid all Miſtakes, that altho our debate at preſent is not concerning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Preſence, yet do I not yield to the drawing of this conſequence from hence, that I acknowledge this Doctrine is believed in the Greek Church, in the ſame Sence as the <hi>Latins</hi> underſtand it. This is not my Opinion, and I ſhall ſay no more of it, but that this point is not the Subject of our preſent debate. It will appear perhaps in the following parts of this Diſcourſe, what ought to be believed touching this matter, it not being needful for this to alter the State of our queſtion.</p>
                        <p>BUT beſides the Obſervations I now made, we muſt likewiſe obſerve, that it does not concern us to know whether the <hi>Greeks</hi> do expreſly reject Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, or whether they have made it a point of Controverſie betwixt them and the <hi>Latins,</hi> but the queſtion here is whether they do poſitively believe it or no. For there is a great deal of difference between Peoples abſolute reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Doctrine, that is to ſay, the making thereof a point of debate, and the not receiving and reckoning it amongſt the Articles of their Faith. Our debate concerns only this laſt, I mean whether the <hi>Greek</hi> Church as it ſtands ſeparate from the <hi>Latin</hi> profeſſes the Doctrine of the Subſtantial Converſion, or not: This is the true ſtate of the queſtion. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> maintains the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, and I the negative, ſo that we muſt ſee now who has the reaſon and truth on his ſide. Yet let me tell him, that deſigning throly to handle this Subject, he ought to have laid down all theſe diſtinctions and leave the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at his own liberty to judge of them. But inſtead of this, there is never a one of theſe Articles which I now mention'd that he has not manifeſtly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. 1. He makes advantage of all thoſe Parties which have been made from time to time, either by the Violence and Authority of the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperors, or by the Intrigues of the <hi>Latins</hi> for the Re-union of the two Churches. 2. He makes uſe of the Teſtimony of Perſons won to the <hi>Roman</hi> Intereſt, ſuch as <hi>Emanuel Calecas, Beſſarion, John Pluſiadenus, Gennudius Scholarius, Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Spatarius, Payſius, Ligardius,</hi> all of 'em Perſons manifeſtly engaged in the Opinions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as ſhall be ſhewed him in the Sequel of this debate. 3. He ſets himſelf upon proving to no purpoſe, that the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41961:73"/> 
                           <hi>Greeks</hi> do not believe as we do the Sacrament to be a Figure or Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that they are not <hi>Berengarians.</hi> 4. He maintains that the Point in queſtion is to know whether they believe the Real Preſence, and that the Diſpute turns eſpecially on this hinge. 5. He ſet himſelf to ſhew that the <hi>Greeks</hi> never made Tranſubſtantiation a point of Controverſie with the <hi>Latins.</hi> Now all this is no more than a general Illuſion, which alters the ſtate of the Queſtion.</p>

For in one of his Letters he ſent me, and out of which I ſhall produce hereafter ſome Articles, he aſſures me he has carefully read ſeveral publick Writings of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as their Symbols, Confeſſions, and Catechiſms, to ſee whether he could find the Term of Tranſubſtantiation in them, which he could not find in any of them. He farther adds, that one of theſe falſe <hi>Greeks</hi> which the <hi>Latins</hi> make uſe of for the propogating of their Doctrines in theſe Countries, having compiled a Catechiſm, wherein he had inſerted the Term of Tranſubſtantiation, he was cenſured for it by the true <hi>Greeks.</hi> But all theſe Teſtimonies are not neceſſary, ſeeing we may read a great many of theſe authentick Pieces of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as their Canons collected by <hi>Balſamon, Zonaras,</hi> and ſeveral others, part of their Liturgies inſerted in the Library of the Fathers, their <hi>Euchology</hi> given us by <hi>James Goar</hi> a <hi>Dominicain,</hi> their <hi>Pontificia</hi> publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Habert</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres,</hi> the Confeſſion of Faith which their Prelats make at the time of their Ordination, the <hi>Typick,</hi> that is to ſay, the Book that regulates every days Office, with their Feſtivals, Faſts and Solemnities, their <hi>Anthology</hi> which particularly contains the Offices for Feſtivals, their Horologies conſiſting of daily Prayers and many other Eccleſiaſtical Books, a great number of which we find in the diſſertation <hi>Leo Allatius</hi> wrote on this Subject. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> who has made an exact ſearch by himſelf and Friends, cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one paſſage that bears the expreſſion of Tranſubſtantiation, which in my judgment is an evident token that 'tis not in them. We may ſee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Books of their moſt approved Authors, as of <hi>John Damaſcene, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephorus</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople, Photius, Theophilact, Oecumenius, Zonaras, Germain, Balſamon, Nicetas Choniatus, Cabiſilas, Marc</hi> of <hi>Epheſus, Jeremias</hi> the Patriarch, <hi>Metrophanus,</hi> and as many others whoſe works are extant, in which we find no ſuch expreſſion as anſwers that of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation. Neither can it be ſaid, that this expreſſion being new and found out but ſince the Conteſt with <hi>Berengarius,</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> have therefore no ſuch word in their Language whereby perfectly to expreſs this, ſeeing they have the term <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, which ſignifies properly <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> We have already ſeen that <hi>Arcudius,</hi> and <hi>Payſius Ligaridius,</hi> have obſerved it, in effect the Latinis'd <hi>Greeks</hi> do commonly uſe it, and it was ever inſerted in the Formulary of Abjuration, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> make, when they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, as I ſhall make it appear hereafter.

                        <p>BUT it may be perhaps replyed, It does not follow that they do not believe with the <hi>Latins</hi> the Doctrine repreſented under this Term, altho they uſe not the Term it ſelf. I anſwer firſt, that if we ſuppoſe the <hi>Greeks</hi> ever held this Opinion, as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would perſwade us, there could not be any reaſon given why the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> has not been found all this while in uſe amongſt their Authors, and ſo much the more becauſe we find that of <gap reason="foreign">

For the <hi>Latins</hi> who had not in common uſe either the Term of <hi>Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatio,</hi> nor <hi>Subſtantiare,</hi> have therefore invented and admitted of that of <hi>Tranſubstantiatio,</hi> and <hi>Tranſubſtantiare,</hi> as moſt proper to expreſs their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions on that Subject, ſo that this very conſideration, That we find not
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41961:74"/> theſe kind of expreſſions in the Writings of the Greeks, is a kind of proof that they believed not the thing ſignified by them. Moreover, the <hi>Latins</hi> having Invented the Term of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> how comes it to paſs the Greeks have not all this while, following their example uſed that of <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, to keep up this perfect Conformity with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has all along ſuppoſed? How comes it to paſs that when this Greek word has been known to 'em, and even the Latins themſelves have taught it them, yet they would not admit of it? and I pray, what ill conveniencies could they apprehend thereby, if they in effect believed the converſion of the Subſtances? It cannot appear ſtrange to us, that there were heretofore Perſons of ſound Judgments, who ſcrupled to admit the term of <hi>Hypoſtaſis,</hi> becauſe that in effect ignorant people would take thence occaſion to imagine, there were ſeveral Divinities; but there can be nothing like this alleadged in reſpect of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> for there is no danger of giving this an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive ſence, beyond what ought to be believed, ſuppoſing we admit the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial converſion. There is rather on the contrary, a kind of neceſſity to make uſe of it, becauſe it expreſſes better than any other this kind of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the Terms, <gap reason="foreign">

He mightily beſtirs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with his Arguments, or rather Declamations on that the Greeks have never quarrelled about this Doctrine, and finds it ſtrange ſuppoſing they were of a contrary belief to the <hi>Latins.</hi> But let him then tell us, wherefore they ſo obſtinately refuſed to uſe the word <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>HOW comes it then to paſs, they never uſed it, but on the contrary, when the <hi>Latins</hi> in theſe forc'd and intereſſed Unions I mentioned in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Book, have propoſed to them the Article of the Euchariſt under the Term of <hi>Tranſubſtantiatur, the Bread is tranſubſtantiated,</hi> they kept to their general expreſſions, ſaying, only <gap reason="foreign">

When Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> towards the end of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Century was minded to ſhew what his belief was on this Subject; he did not indeed uſe the Term of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> becauſe 'twas not then found out, but explained himſelf in ſuch a manner as was ſufficiently clear and

We ſee not any thing of this kind appear in the Cannons of their Councils, Confeſſions of Faith, or Liturgies, Books of Devotions, or any of their Writings, whether publiſhed by their Modern or Ancient Divines, and certainly 'tis very ſtrange theſe people ſhould believe Tranſubſtantiation, and yet at the ſame time not ſo much as declare in expreſs Terms this their belief. For beſides, that theſe Terms are but few and eaſie to be found out, there being nothing more eaſie to a man who believes the Subſtantial converſion, than to ſay, <hi>the Bread is ſubſtantially converted into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, or the ſubſtance of Bread is really changed into the ſubſtance of Chriſt's Body, in ſuch a manner that the former ſubſtance remains no more.</hi> Beſides this, I ſay, they have in the Greek Language words which anſwer exactly the expreſſions of the Latins on this ſubject, and upon this account they would be inexcuſable, expreſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as they do, differently from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were their belief the ſame with hers.</p>

Yet it is evident that whatſoever he has hitherto alledged, which ſeems to intimate the converſion of Subſtances, in all this long diſpute which takes up half his Book, is but a meer Sophiſm, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on us by means of the reunion made between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi> by <hi>Michael Paleologus,</hi> and ſome teſtimonies the ancienteſt of which bears date but from the year, 1641.

                        </argument>
                        <p>THE Common Expreſſions the <hi>Greeks</hi> uſe in the explaining their Belief touching the Myſtery of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> are theſe. They call the Symbols, <hi>the holy gifts, the holy things, the ineffable myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the body and blood of Jeſus Chriſt, the ſanctified bread, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle or parts, the pearl,</hi> and the like. They ſay, <hi>that the Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, that it is made the Body of Jeſus Christ, that 'tis changed into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, that 'tis the real Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>AND to expreſs this change, they uſe the Terms of <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which ſignifie, <hi>to change.</hi> Now 'tis certain theſe expreſſions, whether we take 'em ſeverally, or joyntly, cannot form the Idea of Tranſubſtantiation. For, beſides that being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, they are capable of ſeveral particular ſences, and are found indifferently uſed on other Subjects wherein there is no Tranſubſtantiation imagined, as may be juſtified by a thouſand Examples, if it were needful; beſides this, I ſay, our reaſon guides us never to attribute a particular and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſence to perſons who explain not themſelves otherwiſe than in general Terms, unleſs it evidently appears from ſomething elſe, that they had this particular ſence in their minds.</p>
                        <p>I confeſs that in this caſe, that is to ſay, if it appears they have had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſence in their minds, we ought readily to take their Terms in this ſence, how general ſoever they may be, but if they come not up to this, we can give them no more than a general and undeterminate meaning. We know for example, that in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Tranſubſtantiation is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly believed, when then we are told, <hi>that the Bread is made the Body of Jeſus Christ, or that 'tis changed into the Body of Chriſt;</hi> although theſe words are general, yet do we immediately underſtand them in this particular ſence, that the Bread is changed ſubſtantially into the Body of Chriſt. But had ſhe not elſewhere expreſſed her ſelf touching the change of the Subſtance,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41961:76"/> and had no Council defined it, nor were it to be found in the Confeſſions of Faith, Catechiſms, and other Publick Books, and taught by the Roman Doctours, it is evident we ſhould be unreaſonable, in giving theſe general expreſſions any other than a general ſence, and this generality it ſelf would be an invincible Argument that ſhe never deſcended ſo far as the diſtinct de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of Tranſubſtantiation, and conſequently this would not be an Article of her Belief. Now 'tis after this manner we ought to judge of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, all its expreſſions are general, there appearing nothing elſewhere which determins this generality, or which engages us to attribute to her the particular and diſtinct ſence of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has alledged in the behalf of this, is of no weight. It then neceſſarily follows, that we ought to attribute to her no other than a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſence, and in no wiſe that of Tranſubſtantiation, which is evidently particular and determinate: And even this conſideration, that they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are obliged to uſe Arguments to explain the common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of this Church into a ſence of Tranſubſtantiation, is an infallible mark that ſhe does not believe it.</p>
                        <p>NOW ſeeing this Proof is deciſive, and that it not only eſtabliſheth my Sentiment, but likewiſe overthrows Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s whole diſpute, it will not be therefore amiſs to illuſtrate it and conſider well its Foundations, to the end it may be manifeſted whether the concluſion I draw from hence is juſt and true. Firſt, then we muſt know that Tranſubſtantiation is the preciſe and diſtinct determination of the manner in which the Bread is made the Body of Chriſt, to wit, by a real converſion of the ſubſtance of this Bread into the ſubſtance of this Body; ſo that 'tis impoſſible to believe it without forming a diſtinct <hi>Idea</hi> after this manner, ſeeing it is even this preciſe and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd <hi>Idea</hi> it ſelf. It is then abſurd and contradictory to look for it in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and confuſed <hi>Idea,</hi> which determines nothing, for this is to ſeek for a determination in a thing undetermined, and a diſtinct ſence in a generality, that is to ſay, light in darkneſs. And from hence appears what muſt be the expreſſions of a Church which believes Tranſubſtantiation, and teaches it, for it is neceſſary ſhe teach it in plain terms, which anſwer the diſtinct <hi>Idea</hi> ſhe has of it, and which may immediately form the like in the minds of thoſe that hear her. Now this cannot be done but by expreſs and formal Terms, or by Terms ſo equivalent, that they cannot be turned into a contrary ſence. What I ſay is verifi'd by the example of the Roman Church, whoſe expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are plain and clear, and which immediately ſhew her meaning.</p>
                        <p>MOREOVER we ſhould conſider that the Notion of Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not one of thoſe which are called Speculative, but Practical Notions, which engages them that have it to ſeveral duties and performances, and eſpecially to the ſoverain adoration of this ſame ſubſtance, which before was the ſubſtance of bread, but now the ſame proper numerical ſubſtance of the natural body of Jeſus Chriſt, as ſpeaks the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whence it neceſſarily follows, that a Church which thus believes it, teacheth it in ſuch a manner, that the act of adoration follows freely and naturally of it ſelf..</p>
                        <p>IT is likewiſe to be obſerved, that the matter here in hand concerns the <hi>Greek</hi> Church from the Eleventh Century, which is to ſay, that ſince the conteſts with <hi>Berengarius,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Church has expreſly determined the ſubſtantial converſion, which drove the <hi>Greeks</hi> into a greater neceſſity of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41961:76"/> ſpeaking clearly on this point, either to ſhew their conformity of belief with the <hi>Latins,</hi> or to avoid the falling into the ſame inconveniencies which the <hi>Latins</hi> endeavour'd to avoid by this formal declaration. And this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation is the more conſiderable againſt Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> in that he grants the <hi>Greeks</hi> not to have been ignorant of this circumſtance touching <hi>Berengarius.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>TO know then certainly whether the <hi>Greek</hi> Church believes Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation or not, we need but ſee after what manner ſhe explains her ſelf concerning the <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> for if her expreſſions bear not a ſubſtantial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, either expreſly or equivalently, in ſuch a ſort, that they may eaſily and immediately form the notion thereof, if they be I ſay general, and determine nothing of themſelves, it is a certain proof ſhe does not believe it, for that Church which believes it, and would have its Children do the like, cannot but explain it ſelf clearly and fully on that ſubject. If we examine Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s diſpute on this Principle, which I eſteem as the light of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſence, we ſhall immediately deprive him of all his negative Arguments, taken from the ſilence of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and that of the <hi>Latins;</hi> for altho theſe kind of Arguments are very good in other occaſions, yet it is apparent that to end a queſtion, ſuch a one as this is, which is, Whether the Eaſtern Church believes and teaches Tranſubſtantiation, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſhould have taken a courſe more deciſive than that of conſidering what the <hi>Greeks</hi> have done in relation to the Tranſubſtantiation of the <hi>Latins,</hi> or what the <hi>Latins</hi> have done in reſpect of the belief of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> It were better for us, directly to conſider, after what manner, they themſelves do poſitively explain their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, touching the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> If we find Tranſubſtantiation plainly declared in it; theſe Arguments of ſilence are no longer neceſſary, and if we don't find it clearly expreſſed, there will follow a Concluſion ſo greatly to my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that all Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s negative Arguments will not be able to ſubſiſt before it, for there is a thouſand times more ſolidity in reaſoning after this ſort. A Church doth not clearly teach Tranſubſtantiation, therefore ſhe holds it not, than to argue thus; A Church does not oppoſe Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation held by the <hi>Latins,</hi> therefore ſhe believes it. Beſides that the firſt Argument concludes directly and immediately what the other does not, there is a greater coherence between believing Tranſubſtantiation, and clearly teaching it, than there is repugnance between not believing it, and yet not oppoſing it in perſons who do believe it. There is no reaſon can hinder the <hi>Greeks</hi> from diſtinctly teaching Tranſubſtantiation, ſuppoſing they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it, but there may be ſeveral reaſons which may oblige them from making this Point a matter of diſpute with the <hi>Latins,</hi> altho they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.</p>
                        <p>NEITHER muſt the Profeſſion of Faith, which the Emperour <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Paleologus</hi> ſent (as from the <hi>Greeks)</hi> to Pope <hi>John</hi> the XXI. to finiſh the work of the Re-union of the two Churches be made uſe of againſt us; for beſides that this was an act extorted by force, which is not of any account a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> we do not find that the <hi>Latin</hi> expreſſions which bear that the Bread is <hi>really tranſubſtantiated,</hi> do exactly anſwer the <hi>Greek</hi> expreſſions of the ſame act, which according to all likelyhood contained only, that the Bread is <hi>really changed,</hi> as we ſhall make it appear hereafter.</p>
                        <p>NEITHER are the Atteſtations and particular Teſtimonies which are but from the year 1641. to be urged againſt us, for not to alledge that theſe pieces are apparently the fruit of the Emiſſaries and Seminaries, and that
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41961:77"/> the quality of the Perſons who make theſe atteſtations, does not furniſh them with ſufficient Authority to decide our queſtion, which concerns the body of the <hi>Greek</hi> Schiſmatical Church, all theſe pieces are too new where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to build alone, a Tradition from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                        <p>WE may then already ſee in general that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s whole diſpute is reduced to conſequences, which will be eaſily overthrown by a particular examination of them, which ſhall be done in its place; but in the mean time what I already ſaid is ſufficient to eſtabliſh the validity of my Argument, which is drawn, from that the uſual expreſſions of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> I mean the cleareſt of them, and thoſe which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believes to be moſt favourable to her upon the account of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> only conſiſt in general terms. Whence I conclude they hold not Tranſubſtantiation; for there is nothing more oppoſite to this Doctrine than general expreſſions, ſeeing the belief of the ſubſtantial converſion, as I have already eſtabliſhed it, is in it ſelf the particular and diſtinct determination of the manner of the Bread's being made or changed into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and that 'tis not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but that a Church which believes it, and would inſtruct its people in this Doctrine muſt explain this Point clearly and diſtinctly: And thus in ſtrength'ning my own Arguments, I lay open the weakneſs of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s.</p>
                        <p>BUT this Argument I now produced, ought to be attended by this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing conſideration, which will farther evidence its ſtrength and ſolidity. Which is that the <hi>Greeks</hi> profeſs to receive only for the determinations of Points of Faith, the ſeven firſt general Councils, to wit, that of <hi>Nice,</hi> againſt <hi>Arius</hi> under the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, that at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Macedonius</hi> under <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> that of <hi>Epheſus</hi> againſt <hi>Neſtorius</hi> under <hi>Theodoſius Junior,</hi> that of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> againſt <hi>Eutychus</hi> and <hi>Dioſcorius</hi> under <hi>Marcion,</hi> that of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> upon occaſion of the quarrel of the three Chapters under the Emperour <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> the third of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> againſt the <hi>Monothelites</hi> under <hi>Conſtantine Pogonatus,</hi> and in fine the ſecond of <hi>Nice</hi> on the ſubject of Images under <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and his Mother <hi>Iréna.</hi> Now 'tis certain, there is nothing in all theſe Councils which determins Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, for what is produced concerning the firſt at <hi>Nice; That we muſt conceive by Faith, that the Lamb of God that takes away the ſins of the World, lies ou this holy Table, that he is ſacrificed without a ſacrifice by the Prieſts, and that we do really receive his precious Body and Blood:</hi> This I ſay, as any man may ſee, is not Tranſubſtantiation no more than what is offered us touching the ſecond at <hi>Nice,</hi> as will appear by reading the fifth Chapter of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s ſeventh Book, wherein he relates it. And as to theſe Councils by which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has determin'd the converſion of the Subſtances, as that of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, held at <hi>Rome</hi> in the year 1079. that of <hi>Plaiſance</hi> held in the year 1095. under <hi>Urbain</hi> the Second, that of <hi>Latran</hi> in the year 1215. wherein <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third declared the Doctrine of his Church on this Subject, that of <hi>Conſtance</hi> aſſembled in the year 1414. wherein <hi>Wicliff</hi> was condemned for oppoſing this Doctrine, and in fine that of <hi>Trent,</hi> which eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the preeeding deciſions, the <hi>Greek</hi> Church receives none of theſe, nor makes any account of them. <hi>They all commonly ſay,</hi> ſay's <hi>Richardus</hi> the <note place="margin">Relation of the Iſle of St. <hi>Erinys, chap. 12. pag. 150.</hi>

And in effect, it ſeems to me that this Doctrine is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant enough to be inſerted amongſt the Articles of their Faith already decided or confirmed by Councils, and not amongſt the common cuſtoms, or practices which are ſtill obſerved, altho not expreſly determined, or amongſt the Points, which being minute and inconſiderable, are therefore left unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided, altho they are held. Let the Reader judge, whether 'tis likely a Church would only receive for a determination of Points of Faith the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Councils, wherein there has paſſed not a word concerning Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, and reject others wherein Tranſubſtantiation has been eſtabliſhed, and yet believe this Doctrine as firmly as the <hi>Latins,</hi> and not dare to explain her ſelf in clear and proper terms, which would have eaſed Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> of that great pains he has taken to fill three or four large Books with his long Syllogiſms, the greateſt part of which are beſides the purpoſe. What mean theſe <hi>Greeks</hi> by their general expreſſions, which are good for nothing but to puzzle people? For according to Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> they diſtinctly believe the whole ſubſtance of Bread is changed into the ſubſtance of our Saviour's Body, and teach as they believe, it being their intereſt to do ſo, to the end this Doctrin may prevail with the people to adore this ſubſtance when changed. They are not ignorant of the manner after which the Church of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41961:78"/> 
                           <hi>Rome</hi> explains it ſelf touching this Doctrine. And yet are they obliged not to receive any Doctrine as an Article of Faith, but what has been already determined by the ſeven firſt Councils, in which there's no mention of this <hi>Change</hi> of <hi>Subſtance,</hi> and to reject all thoſe Councils which expresſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed it, and nevertheleſs they expreſs themſelves in general terms, which ſignifie nothing. And muſt Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> (to whoſe immortal praiſe the <hi>Greeks</hi> are ſtill in the World, and to whom they are obliged for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation under the Turkiſh Empire) tire himſelf, his Friends, and his Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; exhauſt his ſtore of Conſequences, that is to ſay, his ſtock of Deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and be continually imploying his invention to find ſome appearance or ſhadow of Tranſubſtantiation in the uſual expreſſions of this People? To ſpeak impartially, he has reaſon to be angry with theſe <hi>Greeks,</hi> who are ſo obſtinate, or at leaſt ſo lazy, that they will not be at the pains to expreſs plainly, and without ambiguity, a Notion ſo clearly and diſtinctly imprinted in their minds. And moreover not only theſe <hi>Greeks</hi> have not explained themſelves; but even when moved by temporal intereſts and the politick intrigues of their Emperours they conſented to theſe patched re-unions with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they have changed the Latin expreſſions, and whereas in the Acts of theſe laſt, it is expresſly mention'd, that the Bread is <hi>Tranſubſtantiated</hi> into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, they have barely inſerted, that it is <hi>changed,</hi> that 'tis <hi>conſecrated,</hi> and in a word, they have ever ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted their general expreſſions, to the formal and preciſe expreſſions of the <hi>Latins.</hi> What can Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> alledge, when on one hand he ſees in <hi>Raynal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> this Confeſſion of Faith, about which he has made ſuch a noiſe, and which was offer'd to the <hi>Greeks</hi> by <hi>Clement IV.</hi> by <hi>Gregory X.</hi> by <hi>John XXI.</hi> and by <hi>Urbain V.</hi> as diſtinctly and clearly containing the Belief of the Roman Church, and that he ſees it, I ſay, expreſſed in theſe <hi>Latins</hi> words, <hi>Sacramentum Euchariſtae ex azymo conficit eadem Romana Eccleſia, tenens &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens</hi>

                           </gap>, and <hi>Tranſubſtantiari,</hi> are two different Terms, which ſignifie not the ſame thing; the firſt is applicable in general to all Myſteries, and ſignifies only, <hi>to be conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated,</hi> or <hi>perfectly conſecrated;</hi> the ſecond ſignifies a <hi>Change of one Subſtance into another.</hi> It is moreover certain, that when the <hi>Latins</hi> wrote <hi>Tranſubſtantiari,</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> have only ſet down <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, why then will he have it, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> took not this Term in its natural ſignification, and in the uſual ſence given to it amongſt them? Becauſe ſay's he, <hi>that the</hi> Latins <hi>took this anſwer for an acknowledgment of Tranſubſtantiation:</hi> But who told him, that the <hi>Latins</hi> did not do ill in taking it after this manner; Who told him the <hi>Greeks</hi> intended the <hi>Latins</hi> ſhould take it in this ſence? The <hi>Greeks</hi> have kept to their general expreſſions, and the <hi>Latins</hi> have drawn them as far as they could to their advantage. If there has been any equivocation in them, the <hi>Latins</hi> have voluntarily made it, and 'tis very likely, could they have made the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſay <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           </gap>, they would gladly have done it, but not being able to effect it, they have made what advantage they could of <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, in interpreting it by the word <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> And this is the whole Secret, which is neither <hi>ridiculous</hi> nor <hi>affrightful</hi> in any other, than Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s imagination.</p>
                        <p>And as to what he ſay's concerning <hi>Syropulus,</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they would have obſerved the <hi>Latins</hi> were deluded by an Equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and accuſe them who thus anſwered in behalf of the <hi>Greeks</hi> of prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and deceit; I ſee no reaſon they had to do this, for when the <hi>Greeks,</hi> ſayd <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, they ſpoke their uſual Language and derided no body. If the <hi>Latins</hi> underſtood it otherwiſe than the force of the Term and common uſe permitted them; 'tis they that derided the <hi>Greeks</hi> rather than the <hi>Greeks</hi> them, wherefore there is no reaſon in this reſpect to accuſe them who made this anſwer of prevarication and deceit. <hi>Andrew de S. Cruce</hi> his relating the words of <hi>Beſſarion</hi> according to the intention of the <hi>Latins,</hi> does but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what I ſay, which is that the Roman Church has ever endeavoured to expound to its advantage the general expreſſions of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and I know not wherefore Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> tells us, that he deſerves no leſs credit than the other Hiſtorians, who wrote of this Council. Would he have it, that <hi>Beſſarion</hi> who ſpeaks for all the reſt of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> did not uſe the Term <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>; This is the very word in the Greek Text concerning that Council, and <hi>Andrew de S. Cruce</hi>'s Authority is not ſufficient to correct a Publick Act, neither can his
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41961:79"/> Latin alter the Greek. Would he have it that the <hi>Latins</hi> explain'd the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> of <hi>Beſſarion</hi> by <hi>Tranſubſtantiatur?</hi> I grant it, and the Decree of the Council ſhows it, ſo that he needs not call <hi>Andrew de St. Cruce</hi> to his aſſiſtance. Yet may we obſerve that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> himſelf is not fully ſatisfi'd that the Greek and Latin expreſſions on this Subject, do mean but one and the ſame thing, altho he tells us he is; for he calls that which <hi>Andrew de S. Cruce,</hi> relates from <hi>Beſſarion, a more preciſe manner, more diſtinct and circumſtantial,</hi> which is as much as to ſay after all, that the <hi>Tranſubſtantiari</hi> of the <hi>Latins</hi> is more preciſe, diſtinct and plain than the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> of the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>AND this the force of Truth has extorted from him; and it were well if it could likewiſe ſo far prevail with him as to make him acknowledge, that this proceeding of the Greeks is an evident mark they believed not <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation.</hi> For had they believed it, what likelyhood is there they ſhould thus carefully keep themſelves from uſing the expreſſions of the <hi>Latins,</hi> which are proper, diſtinct and clear, and change them into others, which are general and equivocal, and that in the ſame Acts wherein thoſe aforementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned exactly deſcribe the converſion of the Subſtances, th'others ſhould be ſo obſtinate, as not to take notice of it. Had they been perſwaded the <hi>Latins</hi> did not innovate, would they not have yielded to a thouſand Reaſons which ſeem'd to conſtrain them to manifeſt their thro Conformity with them? Their Affairs were in very bad circumſtances, they left their Country to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the aſſiſtance of the Weſtern Princes; they were in the Pope's hands, and maintain'd at his charge; they conſented to the re-union of the two Churches; their Emperors did not only ſollicite but conſtrain them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; and they had already offered great violences to their own conſciences, for they conſented to the addition of the <hi>Filioque</hi> in the Creed; what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then could hinder them from acknowledging the <hi>Converſion of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,</hi> had their belief been the ſame with that of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> Wherefore ſhould they ſtill affect their general Terms, of <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>; Wherefore even in the very act of the re-union made at <hi>Florence,</hi> the Term of Tranſubſtantiation was never inſerted, but only that of <hi>confici,</hi> in the Latin, and that of <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> in the Greek? For thus was it ſet down, <gap reason="foreign">

That the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is really conſecrated, or made into Wheaten Bread, either with or without Leven, and that the Prieſts ought to make or conſecrate the Body of our Lord with either of theſe, every one according to the Cuſtom of his Church, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eaſtern or Weſtern.</hi> Here is no mention of the converſion of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, for the general Terms carri'd it away from the determinations of the <hi>Latins.</hi> Neither need Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> tell us as he does, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> took <note place="margin">Lib. 4. cap 2. pag. 346.</note> theſe words in a ſence of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Latins</hi> did ſo; For if the <hi>Greeks</hi> believed a true and real converſion of Subſtance, wherefore then was not that Article expreſſed in clear and proper Terms. The <hi>Latins</hi> were not ignorant of them, the <hi>Greeks</hi> knew them well enough, there being no word more common among them than that of <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. That of <hi>Subſtantia</hi> had been already affected by the <hi>Latins</hi> in the Myſtery of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and the Popes that preceded <hi>Eugenus</hi> the IV. were not wanting to bring it into that famous Confeſſion of Faith which we have ſo often mention'd. In ſhort
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:41961:80"/> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> need not tell us ſo often of theſe <hi>Equivocations,</hi> for we know ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, that in theſe kind of <hi>Accommodations,</hi> wherein intereſt holds the chiefeſt rank, the two Parties agree commonly in certain generalities, which each of 'em endeavour to explain to their own advantage. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more common than theſe kind of Treaties, in which when there's foreſeen any inſuperable difficulties, they are uſually left untoucht, both Parties contenting themſelves with general Terms, by which each of 'em think to compaſs their deſigns. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is a Perſon of too much reading and experience to queſtion a Truth ſo well known, and I believe we need not go far for inſtances of this kind. But, howſoever, this is certain and undeniable, that in all the Decrees of the Florentine Council, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears nothing on the part of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that eſtabliſhes <hi>the converſion of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,</hi> but on the contrary, it ſeems as if they had prevail'd on the <hi>Latins,</hi> to abate their expreſſions in the ſolemn act of their <hi>re-union.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT before we leave this Proof, it is to be obſerved that <hi>Beſſarion</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Nice,</hi> who was one of the Principal Agents in this <hi>Accommodation,</hi> in behalf of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> was a Perſon already brought over to the Intereſts of the <hi>Latins,</hi> and for his good Services was ſoon after made a Cardinal in the Roman Church. It cannot then but be ſuppoſed he favoured the <hi>Latins,</hi> and uſed all poſſible means to prevail on his own Country-men. In effect <hi>Syropulus</hi> complains of this; in ſuch a manner, as ſufficiently ſhews, what judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we ought to make of this particular. In the mean time, compare I pray, the Terms <hi>Beſſarion</hi> uſes when he ſpeaks in behalf of the <hi>Greeks</hi> in the Conferences of the Council, with thoſe he uſes in his Treatiſe of the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,</hi> wherein he ſpeaks from his own head, ſince he was made a Cardinal, <hi>in Specie,</hi> ſay's he, in this Treatiſe, <hi>Panis &amp; Vini, veritas Corporis &amp; Sanguinis continetur, cum in illa, Subſtantia Panis Vinique mutetur. The Body of Jeſus Chriſt is really contain'd under the Species of Bread and Wine, the Subſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing changed into this Body and Blood;</hi> and a little farther, <hi>verba dicuntur qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus dictis mox Conſecratio fit, Tranſubſtantialitas perficitur; The words are no ſooner ſaid but the Conſecration is made, and the Tranſubſtantiation finiſhed.</hi> 'Tis no longer <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, <hi>Conſecration</hi> and <hi>Sanctification,</hi> but <hi>Subſtantia mutatur, Tranſubſtantialitas perficitur, the change of Subſtance, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantion.</hi> Whence comes this difference, but from that the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not uſe the ſame expreſſions as the <hi>Latins,</hi> and that there is not any Conformity between theſe two Churches in this Point of the Converſion of Subſtances? <hi>Beſſarion</hi> counterfiting the Greek, makes uſe only of general expreſſions. But when he diſcovers himſelf to be a <hi>Latin,</hi> he ſpeaks plainly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly.</p>
                        <p>BUT beſides <hi>Beſſarion,</hi> this ſame difference is obſervable in other <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſed Greeks,</hi> engaged to propogate the Roman Doctrines, if we compare their Style with that of the true <hi>Greeks.</hi> Compare for example what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> tells us out of <hi>Emanüel Calecas,</hi> and <hi>John Pluſiadéne,</hi> with what he himſelf alledges out of <hi>Cabiſilas, Mark</hi> of <hi>Epheſus, Simon</hi> of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> and others, and you will find theſe laſt mention not the change of Subſtance, whereas the former do expresſly aſſert it. <hi>Emanuel</hi> tells us concerning the <hi>Euchariſt, that God is able to change the inward Subſtance, and yet conſerve the ſame Accidents entire. Pluſiadene</hi> after the ſame manner, <hi>That the Subſtance of Bread is changed into the Body of Chriſt.</hi> Whereas there's no ſuch expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the true <hi>Greeks:</hi> for we meet only with ſuch expreſſions as theſe, <hi>that the Bread is really the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and that 'tis changed into the</hi>

                           <p>The Sixth Proof taken from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> employing on other Subjects, the ſame Expreſsions as on the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Tenth Deluſion manifeſted.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE only way to judge of the meaning of Authors, when 'tis matter of Debate, is to examine their Style in other like Matters, it being impoſſible, but in comparing their expreſſions ſome of 'em will give light to others. Had Mr <hi>Arnaud</hi> followed this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, he would never have valued ſo highly ſeveral expreſſions in Greek Authors; for he would have ſeen at the ſame time, that they deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves almoſt after the ſame manner on other Subjects, where there's no Tranſubſtantiation to be ſuſpected. I know 'tis a hard matter for a Perſon that is prejudiced, to conſider the queſtion he handles, in thoſe reſpects which are diſagreeable to him; but beſides that this prejudice is a fault, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be avoided, eſpecially when men write on a Publick Account, or take upon them to inſtruct People; beſides this, I ſay, there are ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable matters which ſo offer themſelves to be ſeen, that we cannot abſtain from beholding them; and 'tis more eſpecially in reſpect of theſe, that mens neglect is blame-worthy, becauſe 'tis affected, and is inconſiſtant with the Rules of Sincerity. As for inſtance, how can we approve of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, who has ſcarcely mentioned a word in his Book touching that prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ignorance which has overſpread the Eaſt, in matters of Religion? How can we approve his taking no notice of that multitude of Emiſſaries, wherewith all that Country has been filled, for I know not how many Ages together, nor of the means uſed for the propogation of the Romiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, nor the progreſſes they made. Theſe are things he could not be ignorant of, and are not matters of ſmall importance; ſeeing the Judgment to be made of this whole Controverſie, does in ſome meaſure depend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But not to rehearſe what we already mention'd, how can we bear with him, when he paſſes over in ſilence ſeveral Greek expreſſions, like unto thoſe from which he would draw advantage, and yet are applied to Subjects which have not the leaſt relation to Tranſubſtantiation. Theſe expreſſions offered themſelves to him, and there needed little deliberation to determine what uſe was to be made of them, and what rank they hold in the deciſion of this Controverſie. Yet has he taken no notice of them, for his deſire of vanquiſhing has far exceeded his love to Truth.</p>
                        <p>BUT howſoever 'tis certain the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſpeak almoſt after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner concerning the Church (it being likewiſe the Body of Chriſt) as they do concerning the <hi>Euchariſt. Cabiſilas</hi> is one of the Authors Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has quoted with moſt complacency, having filled a long Chapter with Paſſages taken out of him, he alledges amongſt others, theſe words of his 38 Chapter,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41961:81"/> 
                           <hi>The Church is repreſented in the Myſteries of Religion, not as in the Signs, but as the Members are marked by the Heart, the Tree by the Root, and the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branches by the Vine, foraſmuch as the Myſteries are the Body and Blood of Chriſt, and that this Body and Blood are the Nouriſhment of the Church.</hi> So far is his Allegation; but 'tis requiſite to hear <hi>Cabiſilas</hi> himſelf in the full extent of his Diſcourſe, to judge of the Style of this Author, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. <hi>The Church,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>is repreſented in the Myſteries of Religion, not as in the Signs, but as the Members are in the Heart, the Branches of the Tree in the Root, and the Vine-leaves in the Vine, as ſpeaks our Lord. For here is not only a Communion of Names, or a reference of likeneſs, but 'tis the Identity of the thing it ſelf; For the Myſteries are the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. Now they are the real nouriſhment of the Church, and when ſhe partaketh of them ſhe does not change them into a humane Body, like unto other Food, but ſhe her ſelf is changed into them, <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, foraſmuch as the moſt excellent part has the predominancy. Behold the iron, when 'tis joyned with the fire, it becomes fire, and it does not make the fire become iron, for the fire effaces all the properties of the iron; ſo in like manner if any one could ſee the Church of Chriſt in that reſpect, whereby 'tis united to him, and partakes of his Fleſh, he would behold nothing but the Body of Chriſt, and therefore St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſay's, you are the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and each of you are his Members; For when he calls him the Head and us the Members, he does not repreſent to us thereby the cares of his Providence, nor our ſubjection to him in the ſame ſence as we call our ſelves the Members of our Parents, or Friends, by an hyperbolical way of ſpeaking; But he means what he ſays; That the faithful by the efficacy of this Blood, live the Life which is in Jeſus Chriſt, and have their real dependance on him as their Head, and are clothed with this Body.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It needs not now be demanded of Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> why he cut ſhort this paſſage of <hi>Cabiſilas,</hi> ſeeing the reaſon manifeſtly appears; for if we take but the pains to compare what he alledges from this Author touching the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> with what I now related touching the Church, we ſhall ſoon find that theſe laſt expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are far ſtronger and ſignificant than what he ſay's concerning the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He excludes the bare communion of name and reſemblance between Chriſt and the Church, and eſtabliſhes a perfect Identity. He ſay's the Church is changed into the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. He uſes the compariſon of iron inflamed, which others apply to the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and as if he deſign'd to make us underſtand that the Church is Chriſt's Body in a litteral and complete ſenſe, he aſſures us this is no Hyperbole, and that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks the ſame thing. I am greatly deceived, if there can be any thing found ſo preſſing and comprehenſive in relation to the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> either in this Author, or any other of the true <hi>Greeks;</hi> and this ſhews on one hand, how vain and groundleſs Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Triumphs are, and on the other, how requiſite and neceſſary a thing it is, for men to ſhew the <hi>Subſtantial Converſion,</hi> clearly, and expreſly in the Doctrines of a Church before it be concluded ſhe believes it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>CABISILAS</hi> is not the only man who ſpeaks after this manner touching the Church, for others borrow his proper Terms to explain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fully like him; for we may find the ſame paſſage at large, in the firſt Anſwer of <hi>Jeremias</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to the Divines of <hi>Wittemberg.</hi>

                        <p>NOW this manifeſtly ſhews we ought not to abuſe (as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> do's) their Myſtical expreſſions; for ſeeing they apply them to the Bread, when as yet unconſecrated, and ſpeak of it as if it was our Saviour himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having themſelves as if he was preſent in his Humane Nature; who then can find it ſtrange if they expreſs themſelves above the ordinary rate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Conſecrated Bread, which is the conſummation of the whole Myſtery?

It is evident, that to attribute to them the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a real and ſubſtantial Converſion, according to the ſence of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church they muſt have explain'd themſelves in clear and proper Terms; for ſhould we be guided by Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> who makes the moſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial matters ſerve for Proofs, and draws Conſequences from all Sides, either

                        <p>WE have ſeen in the preceding Chapter, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> when as yet at the <hi>Protheſis,</hi> (that is to ſay, at the little Altar) do ſeparate eleven Particles of Bread, the firſt and principal Particle in honour of our Saviour, the ſecond in honour of his Holy Mother, and the reſt in honour of the Saints, and that they carry all theſe and place them on the high Altar, where the Conſecration is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd.</p>
                        <p>WE muſt here obſerve they believe not that all theſe Particles are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, for they reſtrain this effect to that which bears the name of our Saviour, the others remaining unconſecrated. <hi>Arcudius</hi> affirms <hi>Simeon</hi> of <note place="margin">Arcud. de Sacr.

                           <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> (who lived in the beginning of the Fifteenth Century) to be the Author of this Opinion, againſt which he with much paſſion inveighs. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> tells us we muſt not attribute this Error to all the <hi>Greeks; becauſe,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>that</hi> Simeon <hi>proteſteth before he propoſed it, that he did not offer it dogmatically, but only as a probable Opinion;</hi> But <hi>Arcudius</hi> does not fully ſay this, he only tells us that <hi>Simeon, at the end of his whole Diſcourſe adds, that he mentions not theſe things as Points of Doctrine, becauſe he always follows the Sentiments of the Church.</hi> This is a Clauſe of Submiſſion, but this is not to proteſt before the propoſal of the Opinion, that he offers it but only as a mere Opinion. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> adds, <hi>That 'tis likely the</hi> Greeks <hi>in the Council of</hi> Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <hi>did anſwer the</hi> Latins <hi>according to the ſence of</hi> Simeon, <hi>for the Acts men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Biſhop of</hi> Mytilene <hi>fully ſatisfi'd them touching the Queſtions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, amongſt which this was one.</hi> But he is miſtaken, for the Queſtion of the <hi>Latins</hi> was not concerning the Conſecration of the ſmall Particles, but touching the Making of theſe Particles, and uniting them with the great one, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. <hi>They demanded of us wherefore we divided the Particles in the Oblation,</hi> that is to ſay, on the <hi>Protheſis, and afterwards joyned them to the Divine Bread, or great Conſecrated Particle.</hi> Now this Queſtion does not reſpect the Conſecration of theſe Particles, but ſuppoſes on the contrary they are not conſecrated; for if the <hi>Greeks</hi> believed they were conſecrated, it would be in vain for the <hi>Latins</hi> to demand wherefore they joyn them with that which
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:41961:83"/> is conſecrated. It appears likewiſe by <hi>Arcudius,</hi> that <hi>Gabriel</hi> of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> maintains this Opinion of the non-Conſecration of theſe Particles, not only as the bare Opinion of <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> but as that of the whole Greek Church, for he recites theſe words of <hi>Gabriel, What is it which perſwades me</hi>

                        <p>BUT be it as it will, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> and I would draw from one and the ſame Principle very different Concluſions, the Principle is that the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not believe that the Particles are conſecrated, his Concluſion is, that they then hold Tranſubſtantiation, and mine on the contrary, that they then do not believe it. Let us now ſee which of theſe Concluſions is the trueſt.</p>
                        <p>HE tells us, that when any Object againſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that if their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion be true, <hi>it would follow, that they which communicated of theſe Partcles</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 4. cap. 1. pag. 330.</note> 
                           <hi>would not receive the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; they anſwer, there is put into the cup part of the Host truly conſecrated, which is mixt with its Particles not conſecrated, out of which afterwards they diſtribute in a ſpoon the Communion to the Laity, ſo that it commonly happens that all in general receive ſome part of the Body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and when it ſhould fall out otherwiſe, it would only follow they commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated but of one kind.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT this pretended Anſwer of the <hi>Greeks</hi> hath no other Foundation than Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Authority, who alleges no Author to confirm it, and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cudius</hi> who manages this Diſpute againſt <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Gabriel,</hi> and whence Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has taken all he knows, makes no mention of it.</p>
                        <p>HE adds, <hi>That this Errour invincibly proves the</hi> Greeks <hi>hold Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, and that we need but conſider after what manner they expreſs it.</hi> And he afterwards produces the Paſſages of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Gabriel. The Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on juſt Grounds,</hi> ſay's <hi>Simeon, offers theſe Particles, to ſhew, that this lively Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, ſanctifies both the quick and dead, but ſhe makes them not Gods by nature. He means, that as the Saints are united to God by Grace, but become not Gods in their nature, ſo theſe Particles are united to the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, altho they do not therefore become his Body. And this he clearly expreſſes in theſe words. The Saints being united to Jeſus Chriſt, are deifi'd by Grace, but become not Gods by nature; ſo likewiſe the Particles which are offered upon their account, obtain holineſs by the participation of the Body and Blood, and become one with this Body and Blood by this mixture, but if you conſider them ſeparately, they are not the very Body and Blood of Chriſt, but are only joyned to them. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of</hi>
                           <pb n="136" facs="tcp:41961:84"/> Philadelphia <hi>ſay's the ſame thing in uſing the ſame compariſon, as the Souls of the Saints,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>being brought to the light of the Divinity which enlightens them, become Gods only by participation, and not by nature, ſo theſe Particles, altho united to the Fleſh and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, are not changed, but receive holineſs by participation.</hi> After this Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> concludes in theſe words, <hi>it is as clear as the day, that all this has no ſence, but only as it relates to the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, and that as theſe Authors ſuppoſe theſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles are not tranſubſtantiated, ſo they ſuppoſe the greateſt portion which is offered in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, and from which alone is taken what is reſerved for the ſick, is effectually tranſubſtantiated, and becomes the very Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT I ſhall not ſtick to tell him, his Philoſophy deceives him, for theſe Authors do not diſpute on this Point, that is to ſay whether theſe Particles are tranſubſtantiated or not. But whether they are made the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in the ſame manner as the great Portion. And this does in truth ſuppoſe that the great Portion becomes this Body, but not that it is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated. The compariſon they uſe does not favour this pretended ſuppoſition, for they mean no more by it than this, that as the Saints are indeed united unto God, and partake of his holineſs, but become not Gods by nature, ſo the Particles which repreſent the Saints, are really united with the great one which repreſents our Saviour Chriſt, and partake of its Sanctification, but they become not effectually what the great one is made, to wit, the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. And this is their reaſoning which does not ſatisfie us how the great Particle is made this Body, whether by a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Converſion, or otherwiſe. And thus does Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Logick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude nothing.</p>
                        <p>LET us ſee now the Concluſion I pretend to draw hence. Firſt, we are agreed that in <hi>Simeon</hi>'s ſence theſe little Particles are bread in Subſtance, and repreſent the Saints. Now if we ſuppoſe the biggeſt ceaſes to be Bread, and is made the proper Subſtance of Jeſus Chriſt, there can be nothing more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent than the Ceremony of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> to place in the ſame Myſtery round about our Saviour, who is in his own proper Subſtance, not real Saints, but little morſels of Bread which repreſent them. Now methinks there is a great deal more reaſon in ſaying that the great Particle is the Myſtical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Jeſus Chriſt, and the ſmall ones according to their way, myſtical Saints, than to ſay that the great one is ſubſtantially Jeſus Chriſt, and the ſmall ones, are only Bread in Subſtance, and Saints in the Myſtery.</p>
                        <p>MOREOVER, what means <hi>Simeon,</hi> when he tells us, <hi>that the ſmall</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Apud Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cud. lib. 3. cap. 11.</note> 
                           <hi>Particles become one with the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt by mixture?</hi> which is to ſay, that when they joyn them with the great Particle in the Cup, and mix them therein together, it is no more then but one and the ſame thing. For if we ſuppoſe, that as well the great one, as the leſſer, are the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and myſtical Saints, I find no difficulty therein, for he means that all theſe Particles put together make no more than one Myſtery, which expreſſes that perfect Unity, which is between Chriſt and his Saints, which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him make but one Body. But if on the contrary we ſuppoſe that the firſt Particle is Jeſus Chriſt in Subſtance, there will be found nothing more abſurd than the expreſſion of this Perſon, when he tells us that little Saints made of Bread are converted into the very Subſtance of Jeſus Chriſt. He is one and the ſame with his true Saints, whether they are in Heaven or on
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:41961:84"/> Earth, but to ſay he becomes one and the ſame with their Figures and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations, or with Crums of Bread, which repreſent them on an Altar, is in my opinion ſuch an extravagant fancy, that we ought not to charge the <hi>Greeks</hi> with it.</p>
                        <p>IN fine <hi>Arcudius</hi> aſſures us, that 'tis cuſtomary to adminiſter theſe Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to the People, after the ſame manner as we do the Sacrament. He ſay's indeed that <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Gabriel</hi> warned the Curats not to diſtribute them in this manner to the People, but to adminiſter them with the great Particle mixt and preſſed together in the Cup. <hi>Yet,</hi> adds he, Simeon <hi>ambiguouſly</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Arcud. lib. 3. cap. 10.</note> 
                           <hi>expreſſes himſelf, for he ſay's that the Particles are the Body of our Lord, when they are mixt with the Body and Blood, and are not ſo being ſeparate, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Faithful may partake of them in the Sacrament,</hi> which is to ſay, they may receive them as the real Sacrament. Now tell me I beſeech you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 'tis likely a man that believes the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to be the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, in its proper Subſtance, would ſpeak after this manner. Theſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, ſay's he, become the Body of our Lord when mixt, but ſeparate they are not ſo. Is it that the conjunction and mixture tranſubſtantiates them, and the ſeparation untranſubſtantiates them? If this be his meaning, why does he ſo earneſtly aſſert, that they are not conſecrated? Why does <hi>Gabriel</hi> his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, ſay, <hi>that they are not changed, altho united?</hi> He muſt certainly mean <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> they are the Body of Chriſt, otherwiſe than in propriety of Subſtance, and he ſufficiently explains himſelf, when he ſays in the ſecond paſſage which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has alleged, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>they partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Apud Arc. lib. 3. cap. 11. pag 331.</note> 
                           <hi>of the Body and Blood of our Lord,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> underſtood not amiſs when he tranſlated it, <hi>they receive holineſs by the participation of the Body and Blood.</hi> Which is to ſay, they are made the Body and Blood by a Communication of Sanctity, which comes to them from the great Particle by means of the mixture, even to the making them capable of being given in the Communion to the Faithful. Now there are ſeveral things which do hence neceſſarily follow. For firſt, it follows that the Bread which is the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Jeſus Chriſt, not in Subſtance, but in Sanctification, is ſufficient for the Communion of the Faithful. Secondly, that the great Particle is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in ſuch a manner that it may be communicated to another piece of Bread without the change of its Subſtance, and by conſequence that it is not it ſelf this Body ſubſtantially, for beſides that this manner of being the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is incommunicable, it is evident that if it could be communicated to another Subject, even to the making of it the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, it then follows that this other Subject muſt be tranſubſtantiated. In a word, <hi>Simeon</hi>'s meaning is, that the great Particle is in ſuch a manner the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, that it may communicate this honour to the reſt, and make them become the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in ſuch a ſort as renders them proper for the Communion. And to the ſame effect are theſe words of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cudius. He ſaith,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>that the Particles are the Body of our Lord, when mixt with the Body and Blood, and therefore the Faithful may receive them in the Sacrament,</hi> and theſe other words, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>they communicate, or participate of the Body and Blood of our Lord.</hi> It is then evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he means not that the great Particle is the Body of Chriſt in propriety of Subſtance, for this propriety cannot be communicated to another Subject, if we ſuppoſe at the ſame time as <hi>Simeon</hi> does, that this other Subject re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains really Bread.</p>
                        <p>AND this is my Argument. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> who ſaw the force of it, has
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:41961:85"/> endeavour'd to eſcape it by his uſual Artifices, for on one hand he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from us what <hi>Arcudius</hi> has expresſly declared, to wit, that theſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles are the Body of Chriſt being mixt, and that the faithful may partake of them as of the Sacrament, and on the other, he has miſ-repreſented <hi>Sime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>'s ſence, and pretended it to be to his advantage. But all his Artifices can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hinder us from perceiving that the real Sentiment of the Greek Church is; 1. That the Subſtance of Bread remains in all the Particles, that is to ſay, as well in that which is conſecrated as in all the reſt. 2. That the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Particle becomes the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in full virtue of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and is as it were a Fountain of Grace and Divine Efficacy. 3. That the other Particles by mixture and union with the great Particle do partake of this Sanctification, and become by this means the Body and Blood of our Lord, not after a complete and perfect manner like unto the great Particle, but in a far lower degree, which is yet ſufficient to make them proper to be diſtributed to the People in the Communion, as being the Body and Blood of our Lord.</p>
                        <p>WE ſhall be confirm'd in this opinion, if we conſider the eighth Proof which I ſhall here offer. It conſiſts in that the <hi>Greeks</hi> believe the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> conſecrated on Holy Thurſday, to have a greater efficacy than that which is conſecrated at other times, which may be verifi'd if 'twere needful by the teſtimony of ſeveral Authors. See here what <hi>Prareolus</hi> ſay's; <hi>They aſſure us,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>that this excellent myſtery conſecrated on the day in which our Saviour celebrated his Supper, that is to ſay, on Thurſday in the Holy Week, hath a more excellent virtue, and is more efficatious than when 'tis conſecrated on other days,</hi>

                           <hi>and 'tis for this reaſon, according to</hi> Guy Le Carmes <hi>Relation, that they conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate the Euchariſt (for the ſick) on no other day of the year than in that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Saviour made his laſt Supper, which they keep all the year only for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. John de Lasko</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Gneſne,</hi> and Ambaſſadour from the King of <hi>Poland</hi> to <hi>Leo X.</hi> in the year 1514, relates the ſame thing of the <hi>Moſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> whoſe Religion as every one knows, is in a manner the ſame with that of the <hi>Greeks.

                           <hi>on the day in which our Lord made his laſt Supper, they ſay that this only is proper for the ſick, and not that which is conſecrated at other times, ſo that they conſecrate Bread on that day for the whole year, in a Chalice prepared for that purpoſe, and put it dry and full of maggots (as it is) into the mouth of the ſick with a ſpoon.

                           <hi>impertinent, as to believe, the Holy Euchariſt which is prepared on that day (Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Thurſday) hath a greater virtue to ſanctifie them who receive it, than that which is conſecrated on another day. As if it were not ſtill the ſame Jeſus Chriſt, or as if our Lord was at ſometimes more powerful than at others.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IF it be demanded what conſequence we can hence draw againſt Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation; I anſwer it appears plain enough in it ſelf. For if we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the <hi>Greeks</hi> hold the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to be made the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, in virtue and efficacy, by means of this abundant ſanctification which the Bread receives, we ſhall not find any abſurdity in this other Opinion, which they hold, concerning the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> conſecrated on Holy Thurſday, namely, that it is more efficacious than that conſecrated on other days, for this ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Bread, and quickning Grace which accompanies it may have its degrees; it receives more and leſs, as the Schoolmen ſpeak; but if you ſuppoſe the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to be made the Body of Jeſus Chriſt by converſion of Subſtance, this more and this leſs, which they imagine, cannot be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; it is true indeed that the Sacrament will produce various effects, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the various diſpoſitions of the Perſons who receive it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as there ſhall be more or leſs devotion in a man's Soul, it will feel more or leſs the ſtrength of Grace, but the cauſe will be in them who ſhall receive the Sacrament, and not in the Sacrament it ſelf, nor in the day of its Conſecration. If the Bread becomes the proper Subſtance of the Son of God, it is always of equal virtue in it ſelf; and the time of Conſecration, can neither encreaſe nor diminiſh it. It is then ſcarcely to be imagined, that Perſons who believe Tranſubſtantiation, can fall into this other Opinion; for is it not the ſame Subſtance, the ſame Jeſus Chriſt perſonally, is it not one and the ſame Converſion, which terminates it ſelf in the ſame Subject? Whence then can proceed this <hi>more</hi> and <hi>leſs?</hi> Would they ſay that the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation is made more on one day than another? This thought cannot happen in the mind of thoſe that know what Tranſubſtantiation means. Do they mean that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt has greater virtue in it one day than another? This thought likewiſe cannot happen in the mind of thoſe that know what our Saviour is. Do they hereby only mean that he diſplays a greater efficacy one day than another, altho he has ever the ſame meaſure of it in himſelf? It is certain that this more and this leſs of Grace, which the Faithful receive in the Communion (ſuppoſing we take the proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Jeſus Chriſt with the mouths of our Bodies) cannot proceed from any other cauſe, but that of more or leſs devotion, which we bring with us to the Lord's Table. So that this Opinion of the <hi>Greeks</hi> being found incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant with that of Tranſubſtantiation, and moreover it not appearing clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to us that they have this latter, whereas it is plainly manifeſt they have the other, we are obliged to conclude they hold not the ſubſtantial Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I know we muſt not imagine that men do always ſo exactly adjuſt their Sentiments, that they never contradict themſelves; and I acknowledge
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41961:86"/> the <hi>Greeks</hi> are ignorant enough to have on the ſame Subject contradictory Opinions, but beſides that there are certain palpable contradictions, of which few men how bruitiſh ſoever they be are capable, as this would be to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is the proper Subſtance of the Son of God, and yet to be of a more excellent virtue being conſecrated on Holy Thurſday than on other days; beſides this I ſay, ſeeing it does not expreſly and clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to us from any thing elſe that they believe Tranſubſtantiation, it is far more juſt to give to their Terms, on the ſubject of the <hi>Change</hi> which happens to the Bread, a ſence which agrees with this aforementioned belief, than to give them another which wholly contradicts it, and makes them ridiculous. If they muſt be led to the Subſtantial Converſion, or carried off from it by way of explication of their general expreſſions, there is more reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them in a ſence conformable to their other Opinions, than to make them guilty of manifeſt abſurdities.</p>
                        <p>WOULD Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> lay aſide for a while this Perſonal Intereſt wherewith he ſeems to be tranſported in this Diſpute, and conſider things without paſſion; I am perſwaded he would ſoon acknowledge that the ſence he imputes to the <hi>Greeks</hi> has no reſemblance with the Terms of their Liturgies, nor other uſual expreſſions. As for example, we would know how we muſt underſtand this Clauſe of their Liturgies, <hi>Make this Bread the precious Body of thy Chriſt, and that which is in this Cup the precious Blood of thy Chriſt, changing them by the virtue of thy Holy Spirit.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands them as mentioning a change of Subſtance; I ſay on the contrary, theſe are general Terms, to which we cannot give at fartheſt any more than a general ſence, and that if they muſt have a particular and determinate one, we muſt underſtand them in the ſence of a Myſtical change, and a change of Sanctification, which conſiſts in that the Bread is to us in the ſtead of the Natural Body of Jeſus Chriſt, that it makes deep impreſſions of him in our Souls, that it ſpiritually communicates him to us, and that 'tis accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pani'd with a quickning grace which ſanctifies it, and makes it to be in ſome ſence one and the ſame thing with the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and yet does not this hinder but that the Natural Subſtance of Bread remains. Let us examine the Liturgies themſelves, to ſee which of theſe two ſences are moſt agreeable thereunto.</p>

This Truth is ſo evident, that <hi>Arcudius</hi> has not ſcrupled to acknowledge, that if this Clauſe be taken <hi>(make this Bread the Body of thy Chriſt)</hi> in an abſolute ſence, <note place="margin">Arcud. lib. 3. cap. 33.</note> that is to ſay, that it be made the Body of Chriſt, not in reſpect of us, but ſimply in it ſelf) it will have no agreement nor coherence with theſe other words that follow, <hi>to the end they may be made, &amp;c.</hi> And he makes of this a Principle, for the concluding, that the Conſecration is not performed by this Prayer, but that 'tis already perfected by the words, <hi>this is my Body,</hi> directly contrary to the Sentiment of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who affirm 'tis made by the Prayer. So that if we apply <hi>Arcudius</hi>'s Obſervation to the true Opinion of the Greek Church, to wit, that the Conſecration is performed by this Prayer, we ſhall plainly perceive that their ſence is, That the Bread is made the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in reſpect of us, inaſmuch as it ſanctifies us and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the remiſſion of our ſins.</p>
                        <p>AND with this agrees the Term of <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>IT is no more favour'd by ſeveral other Clauſes in the ſame Liturgy. For in that of St. <hi>James</hi> there is a Prayer, which the Prieſt directs to our Saviour in Heaven; altho he has the Conſecrated Bread before him, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

It plainly appears that the intention of the Greek Church is to ſend up their Devotions to the Place where our Saviour inhabits. How comes it to paſs, we find not at leaſt one Prayer wherein is expreſſed, that he has clothed the proper Subſtance of his Humanity, with the Veil of the Accidents, or ſome ſuch like words? But on the contrary, when the Prieſt reads with a loud voice, <gap reason="foreign">

In fine in this ſame Liturgy the Prieſt having performed his Office in this particular, makes a Prayer unto God, in which he recapitulates whatſoever has paſſed in this Myſtical Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration; but mentions not the leaſt tittle concerning Tranſubſtantiation. <hi>We have,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>finiſhed and conſummated the Myſtery of thy Oeconomy, O Jeſus Chriſt our God, as far as we have been able.

                        <p>ALTHO the <hi>Greeks</hi> do frequently call the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> the Body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, yet muſt we not thereupon immediately conclude that they are in this reſpect of the ſame opinion with the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and adopted Tranſubſtantiation or the ſubſtantial preſence amongſt the Articles of their Faith. One Proof of the contrary of this, is, that ſometimes, when they mention the conſecrated Bread, and give it the name of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, they add a Term of Diminution, which ſhews they do not mean that it is his Body in propriety of Subſtance. Which appears by a paſſage taken out of <hi>Balſamon</hi> on the Seventieth Canon of the Apoſtles. This Canon ordains a puniſhment to thoſe that ſhall faſt with the <hi>Jews,</hi> and celebrate their Feaſts; and <hi>Balſamon</hi> takes hence an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to inveigh againſt the Feaſts of unleavened Bread, in theſe words. <hi>If a</hi>

                        <p>MOREOVER the reaſoning of <hi>Balſamon</hi> and <hi>Blaſtarius</hi> clears the difficulty: for if we ſuppoſe they believed Tranſubſtantiation, we cannot give any tollerable ſence to their Diſcourſes. In effect, either they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that the Azyme was changed into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, as well as the leavened Bread, or deni'd it; if they acknowledged it, their ſence is, that 'tis a great crime to eat the proper Body of Jeſus Chriſt, under the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of an Azyme. Now this is abſurd: for if the Body of Chriſt be really under the Accidents of the Azyme, what crime is there in thus eating of it? For that which is eaten is no longer a real Azyme, but the Subſtance of the Body it ſelf. Wherefore moreover ſhould they be judged more worthy of condemnation than thoſe who mix themſelves with the <hi>Jews</hi> when they celebrate their Feaſt, and eat unleavened Bread with them? For the latter of theſe do really eat an Azyme, whereas the others receive only the Accidents of it, which ſerve as a vayl to the proper fleſh of our Lord. If it be ſaid they do not acknowledge the <hi>Azyme</hi> to be changed into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, as the leavened Bread is, their ſence will be that 'tis a greater Crime to eat an <hi>Azyme,</hi> in ſuppoſing it to be the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, than to eat the ſame Azyme, wittingly and willingly, in the Communion of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Now this is no leſs abſurd, for the intention, and belief, which the firſt have, leſſens their fault, whereas the knowledge and intention of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aggravates it. They that eat the <hi>Azyme</hi> with the <hi>Jews,</hi> mean only to eat an <hi>Azyme;</hi> whereas thoſe that eat it in imagining they eat the Body of our Lord, pretend nothing leſs than to eat an <hi>Azyme;</hi> ſo that it cannot be ſaid in this reſpect, but that the crime of theſe laſt is greater than that of the others. It muſt then be granted that to give a likely ſence to <hi>Balſamon</hi> and <hi>Blaſtarius,</hi> their <hi>quaſi</hi> muſt be a <hi>quaſi</hi> of compariſon and not of <hi>Identity,</hi> and that they mean, that for a man to eat unleavened Bread in ſtead of the Body
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41961:88"/> of Jeſus Chriſt, is a greater crime than to eat it ſimply with the <hi>Jews,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is an introducing of Judaiſm in the Chriſtian Religion, and to make of that which is accurſed, the Myſtery of our Lord's Body. Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> will without doubt reply, that they diſpute againſt the <hi>Latins,</hi> and ſo by conſequence this <hi>quaſi</hi> ought to be taken in the ſence of the <hi>Latins.</hi> Now the <hi>Greeks</hi> know very well that the <hi>Latins</hi> do not receive the Bread of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> inſtead of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, but as being really and in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this Body it ſelf. I anſwer that <hi>Balſamon</hi> and <hi>Blaſtarius</hi> do not diſpute in particular againſt the <hi>Latins,</hi> whom they do not ſo much as mention in the Commentary they wrote on the Seventieth Canon of the Apoſtles; but eſtabliſh in general this Rule, that we ought not to eat unleavened Bread in this Myſtery.

Is it that they behold the Prieſt and receive the Gifts from him? But the Souls that are out of the Body have the Eternal Prieſt, who is to them more than all theſe things, being the ſame likewiſe that adminiſtreth it to them alive, who receive it as they ought to do. For all thoſe to whom the Prieſt adminiſters it, cannot be ſaid truly to receive it. The Prieſt adminiſters it to all that come to him, but our Saviour gives it only to thoſe that are worthy to partake of it: Whence it clearly appears that 'tis our Saviour alone, who by means of this Sacrament conſecrates and ſanctifies the Souls as well of the living as the dead.</hi>

                        <p>NOW if you would know of what importance the Argument is, which we draw from this Doctrine of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> you need but read what <hi>Chifflet</hi> the Jeſuit and others have written touching a paſſage of the Confeſſion at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed <note place="margin">Chifflet. prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat. ad Lector. in Confeſſ. Alcu.</note> to <hi>Alcuinus</hi> which bears, <hi>That the virtue of this Sacrifice is ſo great, that it is the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt only to the juſt ſinners, tanta eſt virtus hujus Sacrificii ut ſolis juſtis peccatoribus Corpus ſit &amp; Sanguis Chriſti. If the Sacrifice, or Sacrament,</hi> ſay's this Jeſuit, <hi>be the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt to ſome only, and not to all, what remains then but to confeſs, that</hi> Alcuinus <hi>has been the Forerunner of</hi> Berengarius <hi>and</hi> Calvin: <hi>and that he has denied the Real Preſence of Jeſus Chriſt in the</hi> Euchariſt? He tells us this paſſage has given him no ſmall trouble, and endeavours to expound it, ſaying, that <hi>Alcuinus</hi> ſpeaks of the Body and Blood of Chriſt in reſpect of their ſaluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous effect which appertains only to the Juſt. But the Authors of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the B. Sacrament; having told us, that it ſeems we muſt read, <hi>tanta</hi>

                           <hi>eſt virtus Sacrificii ut ſolis juſtis, non peccatoribus Sanguis ſit &amp; Corpus Chriſti,</hi> they have added, <hi>that this expreſſion has not been uſed ſince the Hereſie of</hi> Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius, <hi>and that the Schoolmen who have been more ſcrupulous as to Terms, have (after the riſe of the Hereſies touching this Myſtery) avoided it.</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, in my opinion, that if we believe Tranſubſtantiation, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has believed it ſince the time of <hi>Berengarius</hi>'s condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we cannot be of this Belief, that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is only the Body of Jeſus Chriſt to the faithful and not to the wicked. And in effect if the Subſtance of Bread be really <hi>changed</hi> into that of Chriſt's Body, it hence evidently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that all thoſe that communicate thereof (be they either righteous or wicked) do receive this Body as it is, that is to ſay, in its proper Subſtance, covered with the vail of Accidents. So that the <hi>Greeks</hi> aſſerting the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt</hi> not to be the Body of Chriſt to Sinners; (as I have already ſhew'd) makes the Proof I draw hence concerning their not believing of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation to be ſolid and convincing.</p>
                        <p>YET may there be two Objections made againſt my Argument; the Firſt, That what the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſay concerning Chriſt's Body, is to be underſtood only in reſpect of its ſalutiferous effect, as has been declared by the Jeſuit <hi>Chifflet,</hi> and not in reſpect of its Subſtance, which is to ſay, their meaning is, that the wicked do indeed receive the real Subſtance of this Body and Blood, but receive thereby no advantage: The Second, that the Bread re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſumes its former Subſtance, when a wicked man approaches to receive the Communion, and that that of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt withdraws it ſelf. But firſt, I ſay to make people of good ſence contented with this explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they muſt be ſhewed theſe kind of meanings in the Writings of the <hi>Greeks</hi> themſelves, which without queſtion would be met withall, did they hold Tranſubſtantiation. It cannot be denied but this Doctrine they teach concerning the wicked does manifeſtly oppoſe that of the Subſtantial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and furniſheth us with this conception, that if the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> be not the Body of Jeſus Chriſt to the wicked, how can it then be ſaid, that the Subſtance of the Bread has been changed into that of this Body? This ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple does naturally ariſe in the mind of thoſe that believe Tranſubſtantiation, as appears by the example of the Jeſuit <hi>Chifflet,</hi> by that of the Authors of the Office of the bleſſed Sacrament, and by the pre-caution of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Lattin Writers who carefully ſhun theſe kind of expreſſions. We need not doubt but if the <hi>Greeks</hi> believed the converſion of the Subſtances
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:41961:90"/> they would do one of theſe two things, either they would renounce this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Opinion, and deliver themſelves after another manner, or at leaſt they would ſo expound and mollifie it as to ſhelter thereby Tranſubſtantiation. But beſides this, I ſay, if we examine theſe pretended illuſtrations in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular one after another, we ſhall find they are vain and ill apply'd to the <hi>Greeks.</hi> In effect the firſt cannot be of any uſe, becauſe the <hi>Latins</hi> impute to them the Doctrine here in queſtion, as an Error. Now this would not be an Error in reſpect of the <hi>Latins,</hi> if the <hi>Greeks</hi> underſtood it only in this ſence, that the wicked do not receive the ſalutiferous effect of the Body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in the Communion, altho they received the Subſtance of it, for even this is believed in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Yet <hi>Poſſevin</hi> does not only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm they err, but he oppoſes moreover againſt their Error a contrary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to be held, and on which he grounds his cenſure. <hi>They err,</hi> ſay's he, <note place="margin">Poſſevin ubi Supra.</note> 
                           <hi>for the wicked do really receive the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, although they receive it unworthily, and to their condemnation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>AS to the other Objection, 'tis certainly groundleſs, for not to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the extravagancy of this Opinion, that the Subſtance of the Bread is changed into that of Chriſt's Body, and again that of the Body into that of the Bread, the Terms of <hi>Cabaſilas</hi> are ſo clear that they admit not any evaſion, for he diſtinguiſhes two Perſons that give the Communion, one the Prieſt, and th'o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Saviour Chriſt, and he attributes to our Saviour alone the glory of giving his Body and Blood, <hi>'tis likewiſe he himſelf,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>that adminiſters to</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Gabaſilas ubi Supra.</note> 
                           <hi>them amongſt the living who truly receive. For all them to whom the Prieſt gives it, do not truly receive it.</hi> He himſelf; that is to ſay, immediately and without the Prieſts ſharing in the honour thereof. The Prieſt has the honour to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute the Bread, but not of giving the Body and Blood. Now this does wholly overthrow Tranſubſtantiation, and refutes the ſecond Objection which I examine, for if the Bread were tranſubſtantiated, there would be no need of having recourſe to our Saviour himſelf, in order to his giving the Faithfull his Body and Blood, the Prieſt would give it them, for that which he holds in his hands and communicates to the Faithful, would be this Body and Blood in propriety of Subſtance, and <hi>Cabaſilas</hi> would have no reaſon to oppoſe our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to the Prieſt.</p>
                        <p>BUT before we leave this paſſage of <hi>Cabaſilas,</hi> it is neceſſary to obſerve two things, one of which reſpects the Propoſition he would eſtabliſh, and th'other the means he makes uſe of for this. The Propoſition he would eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh is, That the dead receive the ſame as the living when they partake of the <hi>Euchariſt. The purity of the Soul,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>the Love of God, Faith, an earneſt deſire to partake of this Holy Myſtery, a ſecret joy which accompanies this deſire, a fervant appetite and thirſt which makes us run to it, theſe are the things which procure our Sanctification, with which qualifications it is not poſſible but thoſe that approach the Communion do partake of Jeſus Chriſt, and without which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Cap. 42.</note> 
                           <hi>they ſhould. Now all theſe things depend only on the Soul, and are not corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real. There is nothing then which hinders the Souls of the dead from having theſe things as well as the living. If then theſe Souls are in the ſtate and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition requiſite for the receiving of the Myſtery, if he to whom it belongs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow Sanctification and Conſecration is always willing to ſanctifie, and ever deſires to communicate himſelf in all places, what can then hinder this participation?</hi> And a little further, <hi>It is evident,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>by the things I now mention'd, that whatſoever belongs to this Myſtery is common as well to the dead as living,</hi> and a little lower, <hi>the participation of the Holy Gifts is a thing which neceſſarily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Cap. 43.</note>
                           <pb n="149" facs="tcp:41961:90"/> 
                           <hi>the Souls after death. If their joy and repoſe ſprang from any other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; it might be ſaid that even this would be the reward of that purity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are, and this Table would be no longer needful to them. But it is certain that whatſoever makes up their delights and felicity, whether you call it Paradice, or</hi> Abraham'<hi>s boſom, or thoſe happy ſeats free from ſorrow and cares, or that you call it the Kingdom of Heaven it ſelf, all this I ſay is no more than this Bread and Wine. For theſe things are our Mediatour, who is entred as our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner into the Holy Places, who alone conducts us to the Father, who is the only Sun of our Souls, which at this time appeareth and communicates himſelf to all them that are in the Bands of the Fleſh in the manner he himſelf pleaſes, but he ſhall then viſibly manifeſt himſelf without a Vail, when we ſhall ſee him as he is, and ſhall gather together the Eagles about the dead Body.</hi> He afterwards proves that the Souls ſeperate from the Bodies, are far more fit to partake of the Myſteries, than when cloathed with their Fleſh, that whatſoever reſt or recompence they enjoy, is nothing elſe but this Bread and this Cup, of which the dead have as much right to participate as the living, and for this reaſon, our Saviour calls the Saints felicity <hi>a Supper,</hi> to ſhew us thereby, that 'tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but this Table. And this already gives us great cauſe to ſuſpect that <hi>Cabaſilas</hi> did not believe that which we eat in the Sacrament to be the proper Subſtance of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt; for we muſt not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine he thought the Souls of the dead did really partake thereof. They do indeed participate of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, but after a ſpiritual manner, which is accompliſhed without our Saviour's Subſtance entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Yet <hi>Cabaſilas</hi> ſay's the dead receive the <hi>Holy Gifts,</hi> that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Myſtery, and that which makes up their felicity, is this Bread and Cup, that they partake of it, and that whatſoever appertains to this Myſtery is common to them with the Living. All which is well enough underſtood provided it be ſuppoſed we have no other Communion with our Saviour Chriſt in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> than what is Spiritual, for the Souls ſeperate from the Body have this as well as we, and partake of our Bread and Cup, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their Subſtance and Matter, but in reſpect of the Myſtery they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Grace they communicate, and thus it is certain that whatſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to this Myſtery is common to them with the living. But if we ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Subſtantial Converſion, how could it be ſaid, <hi>They partake of the Holy Gifts, that they receive what we receive, that we have nothing more in the Myſtery than they, and that whatſoever appertains to the Myſtery is common to them with us?</hi> For in fine we ſhould really receive the proper Subſtance of the Body and Blood of Chriſt which they do not.</p>
                        <p>BUT to manifeſt more clearly this Doctrine of <hi>Cabaſilas</hi> and put it out of doubt, we ſhould conſider the courſe he takes for the ſtrengthening of his Propoſition. For it will appear that this participation of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, which he makes common both to the dead and living, reſpects not only the thing of which we partake, but likewiſe the manner of partaking of it; and in a word, he means we communicate thereof no otherwiſe than Spiritually. Firſt, then he always ſpeaks of the Sanctification which is made by way of participation and reception of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, as of one and the ſame thing, without the leaſt difference, which is juſtifi'd by the bare reading of his whole Diſcourſe. Now this ſhews us, he means not that we receive in the Sacrament the proper Subſtance of the Body of our Lord, for if it were ſo, the wicked would receive it without receiving Sanctification, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf does acknowledge, and the reception of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and the Sanctification, could not be conſidered but as two diſtinct
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41961:91"/> things. Yet <hi>Cabaſilas</hi> confounds them, and thereupon immediately conſiders this difficulty; how the dead which neither eat nor drink can be ſanctifi'd by this participation. <hi>Are they,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>in a worſe condition in this reſpect than the living? No ſure,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>for our Saviour communicates himſelf to them in</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Cap. 42.</note> 
                           <hi>ſuch a manner as is beſt known to himſelf.</hi> He afterwards inquires into the cauſes of the ſanctification of the living, and their participation of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſay's, <hi>'tis not to have a Body, nor to come with feet to the Holy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor to receive the Communion with our hand and mouth, nor to eat or drink, but that 'tis the purity of the Soul, Faith, Love of God, and other motives of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, theſe are the things,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>which make us neceſſarily partakers of Jeſus Chriſt, and without which it is not poſſible to be ſo.</hi> Whence he concludes that the Souls ſeperate from the Body are capable of this participation, and that in effect they have it ſeeing they have all theſe good affections. Now it hence plainly appears that he grants the living but one kind of participation of Jeſus Chriſt which is Spiritual; and which they have in common with the dead, and which immediately reſpects the Soul. For if they be only the good diſpoſitions of the Soul which make us partakers of Jeſus Chriſt, and that without them it is not poſſible for us to be ſo, and that the dead have the ſame advantage we have, it cannot then be ſaid, we receive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Subſtance of the Body, ſeeing on one hand according to the Hypotheſis of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the want of theſe diſpoſitions hinders not men from receiving it, and on the other that the dead with all theſe their qualifications cannot receive it.</p>
                        <p>THIS appears by the Sequel of his reaſoning, for what he ſay's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the dead, the ſame he ſay's concerning the living which dwell in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, and that cannot perſonally come to the Lord's Table. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> ſay's he, <hi>ſanctifies them inviſibly with this Sanctification. How can we know this? I anſwer, becauſe they have the life in themſelves, and they would not have it, were they not partakers of this Myſtery. For our Saviour himſelf has ſaid, unleſs you eat the Fleſh of the Son of man, and drink his Blood, you have no life in you. And for a further confirmation of this, he has cauſed to be brought to ſeveral of theſe Saints, the Gifts, by the Miniſtry of Angels.</hi> It is evident, he attributes to theſe Inhabitants of Deſerts, the ſame participation of Jeſus Chriſt, the ſame manducation of his Fleſh and Blood which we receive in the Sacrament without the leaſt difference, whence it follows, that our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Jeſus Chriſt by means of the Sacrament is purely Spiritual, and that our eating of his Fleſh is Spiritual likewiſe, there being no need of adding the reception of his Subſtance into our Stomacks.</p>
                        <p>BUT yet this does more plainly appear by what follows. <hi>The Gift,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>is indeed communicated to the living by means of the Body, but it firſt paſſes to the Subſtance of the Soul, and afterwards communicates it ſelf to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by the Miniſtry of the Soul. Which St.</hi> Paul <hi>meant when he ſaid, that he that is joyned to the Lord, is one and the ſame Spirit with him, becauſe this Union and Conjunction is made firſt of all in the Soul. This being the Seat of this San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification which we obtain by the exerciſe of our virtues. This is likewiſe the Seat of Sin. 'Tis here wherein is the Band of Servitude, by which the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment links us to God. The Body has nothing but what it derives from the Soul, and as its pollutions proceed from the evil thoughts of the heart, from the heart likewiſe comes its Sanctification; as well that of the Virtues, as that of the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. If then the Soul has no need of the Body, to receive Sanctification, but the Body on the contrary of the Soul, why then muſt the Souls which are yet cloathed with their</hi>
                           <pb n="151" facs="tcp:41961:91"/> 
                           <hi>Bodies be greater partakers of the Myſtery, than thoſe ſtript of them?</hi> We muſt be ſtrangely prepoſſeſſed with prejudice, if we do not acknowledge that this Author only eſtabliſhes the ſanctifying and ſpiritual Communion, and not that of the proper Subſtance of the Body and Blood of our Saviour, for if we ſuppoſe the Bread to be the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in Sanctification and Virtue, it is eaſie to comprehend what he means, but if we ſuppoſe Tranſubſtantiation, how ſhall we then underſtand what he ſay's, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Gift</hi> is indeed received by the Body, but it immediately paſſes to the Soul and afterwards communicates it ſelf from the Soul to the Body? Does not the Subſtance of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt deſcend immediately from the Mouth into the Stomack, and does it not remain there till the change of the Species? How then ſhall we underſtand him when he ſay's, that our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Jeſus Chriſt is firſt eſtabliſhed in the Soul? For 'tis certain, that to judge of it, in the ſence of Tranſubſtantiation, it would be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the contrary firſt of all in the Body, which would be the firſt Subject that would receive the Subſtance of the Fleſh and Blood of our Lord. How ſhall we underſtand the Concluſion he draws from all this Diſcourſe, to wit, that the Souls of the dead are no leſs partakers of this Myſtery than thoſe of the living, for the living do communicate after two manners, Spiritually and Subſtantially, whereas the dead only in one? How in fine, ſhall we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what he means in ſaying that the Body has no other Sanctification by means of the Myſtery, than that which comes to it from the Soul? Is it no wiſe ſanctifi'd by touching the proper Subſtance of the Son of God.</p>

                           <hi>the Gifts? But they that are out of the Body have the great Eternal High Prieſt, who is to them all theſe things; It being he indeed that adminiſters to them that truly receive.</hi> Was there ever any man that betrayed ſuch a want of memory as this man does, ſhould it be ſuppoſed he believed Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation? Could he not remember that the living have not only this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage above the dead to behold the Prieſt, and receive from him the Gifts, but likewiſe to receive the proper Subſtance of their Saviour? Could not he call to mind, that the Spiritual Communion, remaining common both to the one and the others, the Subſtantial was particularly to the living? Moreover, what does he mean in ſaying, that as 'tis Jeſus Chriſt that adminiſters it to the dead, ſo it is he likewiſe that gives it to the living that effectually receive it? Is it that the Prieſt who gives the proper Subſtance of Jeſus Chriſt does not truly and effectually adminiſter it? Is it that this Subſtance which is called with ſo great an Emphaſis, <hi>the Truth and Reality,</hi> and which Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> always underſtands, when he finds theſe kind of expreſſions, <hi>the real Body, and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> Is it, I ſay, that this is not a Truth?</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> can without doubt remove all theſe difficulties when he pleaſes, and 'tis likely he will find a way to reconcile them with the belief of Tranſubſtantiation, ſeeing he himſelf has heretofore written, <hi>that God ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits</hi>

But it being no ways reaſonable that what Mr <hi>Arnaud</hi> has ſaid at one time contradictorily to what he has ſaid at another, ſhould ſerve me as a Rule for the underſtanding of Authors, all that I can do in his favour is this, freely to offer him to lay aſide the Proof taken from <hi>Cabaſilas,</hi> when he ſhall have made his Propoſition to be approved of in the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                        <p>VVE may I think already begin to doubt, whether the <hi>Greeks</hi> have in effect the ſame Sentiments with the <hi>Latins</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tranſubſtantiation, and whether the aſſurances Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> has given us thereof be well grounded. He appears very brisk and confident in aſſerting this Point, and behaves himſelf as a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that has already conquered, but 'tis more than probable that theſe flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes are the effects of that kind of Rhetorick which teaches men to put forth their voices in the weakeſt part of their cauſe, to the end they may obtain that by noiſe, which they could not by reaſon. But howſoever, it may now be demanded what will become of all thoſe Hiſtorical Collections, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, Atteſtations, Conſequences, Keys, Syſtems, thoſe confident Defies, and Challenges to produce any thing which had the leaſt appearance of Truth or Reaſon againſt his Proofs, and in a word of all this great torrent of Eloquence and mundane Philoſophy.

                        <p>THE Proofs I have already produced do ſufficiently confirm this, but that which I ſhall farther offer will yet more evidence it, and at the ſame time diſcover another of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Illuſions. My Proof ſhall be taken from the <hi>Greeks</hi> not adoring the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> with that Sovereign Adoration the <hi>Latins</hi> do. Now if this be made apparent, what likelihood is there, that a Church which otherwiſe is not at all ſcrupulous in matters of Ceremony, and which has ſuch a great devotion for Pictures, for the Writings of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:41961:92"/> conſecrated Bread which they call <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, and even the Bread of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> before 'tis conſecrated, ſhould believe the Subſtance of the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols to be really changed into the Subſtance of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, and yet not render it that Sovereign Honour which belongs to it. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us then to know what the Cuſtom of the <hi>Greeks</hi> is touching this Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſo much the more, becauſe this Queſtion being one of the chief of our Diſpute, it is therefore abſolutely neceſſary to be throughly inform'd in it.</p>
                        <p>BUT before we proceed any farther, we muſt diſtinguiſh (according to the ſence of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins)</hi> two ſorts of Adoration, the one inferiour and ſubalternate which is rendred to Subjects, in which we do not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge an infinite Majeſty, and th'other a Sovereign and Higheſt Worſhip, called that of <hi>Latria,</hi> which is only due to God.</p>
                        <p>WE muſt likewiſe diſtinguiſh according to the ſence of the ſame <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> an Adoration called relative, which terminates not it ſelf in any one Subject, but paſſes (as it were) from one Subject to another, as thro a Channel; and an abſolute Adoration, which terminates it ſelf in that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which is worſhipped, without a reference to any thing elſe.</p>
                        <p>IN fine there ought to be a diſtinction made betwixt an internal Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which conſiſts in the motions of the Soul towards the Subject adored, and the external Adoration which conſiſts in outward expreſſions.</p>
                        <p>WHICH Diſtinctions being premiſed, we are now to enquire whether the <hi>Greeks</hi> adore the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> with a Sovereign Adoration, and that of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria,</hi> not relatively, (as we ſpeak) but abſolutely, and in the ſame manner we ought to worſhip the proper Subſtance and Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt. And becauſe the internal affections of the Soul, cannot be immediately known, it therefore concerns us to enquire whether the <hi>Greeks</hi> do outwardly expreſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sign of ſuch an Adoration, either by their words or actions. Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> holds the affirmative and I the negative, and this being here only a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of Fact, 'tis likewiſe by Proofs of fact wherewith it muſt be decided.</p>
                        <p>FOR this effect I ſhall firſt here offer the teſtimony of a Cannon of <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covia</hi> called <hi>Sacranus,</hi> who in reckoning up the Errors of the <hi>Moſcovits,</hi> (whom we all know do follow the Greek Religion) does expreſly mention this. <hi>Before the Cup is prepared,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>they light Torches and expoſe to the</hi>

                           <hi>Peoples ſight with exceeding great devotion the Bread, which is to be conſecrated, with the Wine and hot Water, which they pour into the Chalice. They carry theſe about, and the People bow down before them with the greateſt teſtimonies of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and veneration. But afterwards when the Bread is placed on the Altar and conſecrated, there is no veneration ſhewed it, nor do they make any elevation of it.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>PETER Scarga</hi> a Jeſuit of <hi>Vilna</hi> in <hi>Lituania</hi> has written a Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41961:93"/> the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> which he intitled, <hi>de uno paſtore,</hi> in which, <note place="margin">Par. 3. cap. 2. art. 8.</note> making a Catalogue of their Errors, he particularly mentions this. <hi>At Maſs they worſhip on their knees the Bread before 'tis conſecrated, but after its Conſecration they give no honour to the moſt Holy Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>SO that we have here already three Witneſſes whoſe Teſtimonies are not to be rejected, ſeeing they are of far greater weight than the forced conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> for they lived in thoſe Parts, and were eye-witneſſes, of what they tell us, and moreover conſiderable Perſons in the Romiſh Church, the firſt of them being a Cannon, th'other an Archbiſhop, and the third a Jeſuit, who do all three of them poſitively affirm the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not adore the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> after Conſecration. Behold here a fourth of the ſame Order, which is <hi>Anthony Caucus</hi> a <hi>Venetian,</hi> and Archbiſhop of <hi>Corfou.</hi> He had an order from Pope <hi>Gregory XIII.</hi> to inform himſelf exactly of the belief of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and to make him a Relation thereof which he did. <hi>Allatius</hi> ſpeaks of this Relation as if it were publiſhed. I confeſs I never ſaw it in print, but I have ſeen a Manuſcript of it in the King's Library, wherein I found theſe words in the thirteenth Article of their Errors. <hi>They yield no Reverence, Honour, Veneration, nor Worſhip to the moſt Holy Sacrament of the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>conſecrated with leavened Bread according to their Cuſtom, they carry it to the ſick without Lights and Torches. They keep it in their Churches in a bag hanging againſt a wall in a little wooden box, and yet burn Tapers before the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of all the Saints.</hi> He informs us elſewhere that the Greek Prieſts when they carry the Sacrament to the Sick, are wont to wrap it up in a linnen cloth, or Handkercher, and ſo put it into their boſoms without any other Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony. But when he ſets himſelf to the oppoſing of this Error, he thus ſpeaks. <hi>There's no People (that I know of) who profeſs the Chriſtian Religion that ſhew leſs reſpect and veneration to the Holy Sacrament, than the Greek Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They adore and reverence their leavened Bread before 'tis conſecrated, even to the very idolizing of it, but after ſcarcely riſe up to reſpect it. Their Prieſt carry the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>in their boſoms to the ſick, without any Lights, and that which is moſt abſurd is, they keep it in their Churches in a little wooden box, tied up in a bag and hanged againſt a wall without any Lights before it, as if 'twere a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane thing to the ſcandalizing of all pious People. I believe they have this Cuſtom from the Heretical Sacramentaries, who deny the virtue of this moſt Holy Sacrament. They are moreover ſo ſuper ſtitious and covetous, that when deceaſed Perſons have bequeathed them any Legacy, they light Candles before the Images of all the Saints, drawing near to them with the greateſt teſtimonies of reverence when they enter the Churches, but they turn their backs to the Holy Sacrament of the</hi> Euchariſt. <hi>I wondred to ſee them do thus, and being deſirous to inform my ſelf of the reaſon of this irreverence, ſhewing them how grievouſly they erred, in that they teſtifi'd a greater reſpect to the Saints who are the ſervants and friends of our Saviour than to himſelf, who is their Lord and Maſter. Theſe Papa's gave me no other anſwer but that there was no command which enjoyned this reſpect and adoration. This anſwer is Heretical as I ſhall hereafter manifeſt, for</hi> John Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colampadus <hi>(that arch Heretick of our time the ring-leader of the Sacrament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, aſſerted that our Saviour was not contain'd in the Sacrament of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt) has likewiſe written and publickly taught that we ought in no wiſe to adore the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>with an Adoration of</hi> Latria, <hi>terming all them Idolaters that did ſo.</hi> Wherefore let Catholicks judge whether this does not well agree with the Opinion of the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IT will be thought perhaps, this Author ſpeaks only of ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:41961:93"/> Perſons and not of the Greek Church in general, but ſuch Perſons may be ſoon ſatisfi'd when they read what follows towards the end of his Relation, <hi>Behold moſt Holy Father,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>all the Hereſies of the Modern</hi> Greeks <hi>which I have laid open and confuted as well as I could. I ſay the Hereſies of the</hi> Greeks, <hi>not only of the Inhabitants of</hi> Corfou, <hi>but of all the Eaſtern</hi> Greeks, <hi>to the end the others may not magnifie themſelves, for they have all the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, the ſame will, and obſtinacy, to maintain every where the ſame things,</hi> And here I think is another good Witneſs, being likewiſe an Archbiſhop, and a Perſon that wanted neither Wit nor Learning, who dwelt among the <hi>Greeks.</hi> He affirms preciſely as well as the reſt, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not adore the Sacrament. He proceeds farther and lays this to their charge as a crime, and aggravates it by comparing it with the reſpect they ſhew the Images; he relates their Reaſons, there being no command enjoyning this Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He condemns this Opinion as Heretical, and likens it unto that of the chief of Hereticks; he farther tells us, that this is not only the opinion of ſome particular Perſons, but of all the Eaſtern <hi>Greeks,</hi> and in ſhort he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks the irreverences which are directly oppoſite to all kinds of Adoration. What can be more expreſſive, and what can Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> reply to this? Will he call again here to his aſſiſtance <hi>Allatius</hi> who diſputes againſt <hi>Caucus,</hi> and would have it believed that this Archbiſhop has falſely charged the <hi>Greeks.</hi> But beſides that it cannot be ſhewed by what intereſt <hi>Caucus</hi> ſhould be moved to form ſuch an accuſation contrary to the reſpect he owed the Pope, and that his teſtimony is found conformable to that of ſeveral others, it is certain that <hi>Allatius</hi> himſelf is of all men the moſt paſſionate and leaſt ſincere, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently denying and affirming things according to his own Capricio, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Intereſt, and that which likewiſe is moſt conſiderable, is, that <hi>Allatius</hi> who meddles with other Articles dared not touch in particular on this, ſo that his ſilence is a confirmation of what I ſay.</p>
                        <p>THE Jeſuit that wrote the Relation touching St. <hi>Erinis,</hi> affirms almoſt <note place="margin">Relation of the I ſle of St. <hi>Frinis cap. 12. pag. 142.</hi>
                           </note> the ſame thing as <hi>Caucus. A great abuſe,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>has crept in amongſt the</hi> Greeks. <hi>For when the Prieſt comes from the leſſer Altar to the Offertory, to paſs on to the great one, all the People there preſent adore the Bread which is not yet conſecrated, and ſhew a greater devotion during this action, than in or after the time of Conſecration; for in the time of the Conſecration they put out the Torches which they lighted for the Offertory.</hi> And in another place, <hi>We ſee</hi>

                           <hi>by what has been ſaid in the foregoing Chapters how greatly the</hi> Greeks <hi>are to blame for the little reſpect they yield to this adorable Sacrament, ſeeing that having conſecrated on Holy Thurſday a great quantity of Particles, they keep them all the year in a little wooden box incloſed in a bag, and hanged on a nail over the Altar, or behind an Image, without a light or any other mark of venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When they enter into the Church to ſay their Prayers, you may ſee 'em make a profound bow, before the Images of our Lord, or Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>or ſome other Saint, but you will never ſee them proſtrate themſelves before this adorable Sacrament. We have often reprehended them for this fault, and ſome have promiſed to amend it, others are really ſenſible of the unſeemlineſs of this their carriage; but being loath to appear ſingular in their Devotions, they chooſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to follow the Cuſtoms of an ignorant People than to render themſelves up to reaſon. So great force has ill examples over weak minds. Some time ſince the Lady</hi> Margareta D'argenta, <hi>a Perſon both devout and eloquent, told me, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in company with ſome</hi> Greeks, <hi>ſhe ſharply rebuked them upon this occaſion; you</hi> Greeks <hi>really ſhow your ſelves, ſaid ſhe, in matters of Religion, to be void of ſence, not knowing to whom you owe your reſpects, nor to whom to direct your</hi>
                           <pb n="156" facs="tcp:41961:94"/> 
                           <hi>Prayers. On one hand you acknowledge that Jeſus Chriſt who is God and Man, our Creator and Redeemer, is really in the Sacrament, with all the Treaſures of his Graces, and on the other, we can ſee you ſhow him not any reverence anſwerable to the reſpect of his Majeſty. I have been ſeveral times in your Churches, and having ſought the only object of my affection, and the God of my heart, I found, you keep him cloſe ſhut in a wooden box, hanging up in a little bag on a nail cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with duſt and cobwebs. A Saviour in a pitiful box, an Infinite Majeſty in the duſt, an Almighty God in a bag, hanged on a nail! He is not thus treated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, you may ſee him receive an other kind of uſage, ſhewing him far greater reſpect than this. Our Prieſts keep him in a ſilver Pyx, he reſts in a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle gilded without, and within covered with Sattin, and to ſhew that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he is the Light which light'neth our Underſtandings, and enflameth our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, we have Lamps always burning day and night before him. When we come into our Churches we ſet not our ſelves upon conſidering the ſeveral Pictures and other Ornaments, for our affections do immediately lead us to the place where we believe our Treaſure is. Whereas you keep your ſelves ſtanding like the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, and we fall on our knees with the Publican.</hi>

                        <p>THAT which the Jeſuit makes this woman ſpeak concerning the <hi>Greeks</hi> believing the real Preſence, is forged by him without any grounds in the ſence wherein he takes it, that is to ſay, as a <hi>Subſtantial Preſence,</hi> for 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not thus underſtand it. But whatſoever he otherwiſe tells us is matter of fact which he has ſeen himſelf, and concerning the truth of which we have no reaſon to doubt. Now theſe Facts are ſuch, that we cannot but judge them inconſiſtent with the belief of adoring the Sacrament of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> with ſuch a Supreme Adoration as is due to the Son of God alone.</p>
                        <p>THE Author that wrote Mr. <hi>De la Haye</hi>'s Voyages the French Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour, <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Haye</hi>'s Voyages, <hi>part.</hi> 49.</note> obſerves the ſame thing as the others concerning the linnen bag, and that they hang it on a nail behind the Altar, wherein they put the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated Particles. He ſays he thus ſaw it at <hi>Selivrée,</hi> and ſeveral other places. But becauſe this remark might offend his Readers, he has therefore attributed the cauſe thereof to the great poverty of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> but this is but a falſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, for the <hi>Greeks</hi> are not ſo poor, but that they may keep the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> in a more decent manner, did they believe it to be the proper Subſtance of Jeſus Chriſt. The true reaſon of this Cuſtom, is, that they do not believe what the <hi>Latins</hi> do, (or as ſpeaks <hi>Caucus)</hi> they do not believe there is any command which enjoyns them to reverence the Sacrament according to the made of the <hi>Latins.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Thevenot</hi> an exact and inquiſitive Traveller, gives us an account of <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Thevenot</hi>'s Voyages, <hi>part. 2 ch.</hi> 77.</note> the manner, which the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> uſes in celebrating the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; but in all his Relation there is not a word of Adoration, and he is even forced to ſay, <hi>that they do in truth behave themſelves with leſs reſpect at the Communion than the</hi> Latins.</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>de Montconis</hi> deſcribes likewiſe very exactly the Divine Service, <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Montconis</hi>'s Voyages, <hi>p. 228. &amp;c.</hi>
                           </note> which he ſaw perform'd by a Greek Archbiſhop at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves not any thing which ſhews they adored the Sacrament.</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> who has ſeen the uſe which might be made of the expreſs Teſtimonies by which it appears the <hi>Greeks</hi> adore not the Sacrament, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:41961:94"/> ſeveral other Proofs which might be added, and which conclude the ſame thing, has betook himſelf to his uſual Artifices. Firſt of all he has avoided the handling of the queſtion touching the Adoration, as a means whereby to clear up that of Tranſubſtantiation, or the real Preſence. He on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry handles it only as a neceſſary conſequence of it, I would ſay, that inſtead of arguing thus, the <hi>Greeks</hi> give to the Sacrament the Supreme Honour which is due to Jeſus Chriſt; they believe therefore that the Sacrament is Jeſus Chriſt in propriety of Subſtance, he reaſons on the contrary after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the <hi>Greeks</hi> believe Tranſubſtantiation and the real Preſence, therefore they adore the Sacrament. Now I ſay there is a great deal of deceit in this method, for although Tranſubſtantiation may be uſed, when 'tis agreed 'tis believed, as a means whereby to conclude, that thoſe who believe it adore it, yet who ſees not, that in this debate wherein I deny both one and the other of theſe to Mr <hi>Arnaud,</hi> it had been a more juſt and natural courſe to begin with the Adoration as a means whereby to conclude Tranſubſtantiation? For Adoration is a thing which diſcovers it ſelf by outward acts, a publick Rite wherein a whole Church agrees, and conſequently is more ſenſible and apparent, and more eaſily known than an Article of Faith, concerning which we muſt conſult the Writings of the Learned, judge of Perſons, and weigh their expreſſions. It is certainly a great deal eaſier for us to know whether the <hi>Greeks</hi> give the ſame honour to the Sacrament which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does, or one equivalent thereunto, than to know what their belief is touching the Subſtantial Converſion. We may be impoſed on by this laſt, for there may be forged atteſtations produced, and hunger ſtarv'd <hi>Greeks</hi> brought in as witneſſes, whom a ſmall penſion will byaſs either way; or the Decrees of Latinis'd Synods offer'd us for thoſe of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> A Conſul zealous for his Religion may eaſily give or admit a change. The teſtimony of a falſe Greek may be alledged, as of that of a true one, and moreover 'tis no hard matter to dazle peoples eyes by a long train of Narrations and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. But it is not ſo eaſie a matter to make uſe of all theſe falſe colours in the point of the Adoration. In a word, it plainly appears that Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi>'s deſign was to ſend back this Article to his Treatiſe of Conſequences, to hinder us from treating of it according to our method of Proofs.</p>
                        <p>THE ſecond thing he does, ſeems to correct the firſt; for he pretends to eſtabliſh this Adoration by particular Proofs, which he calls groſs Proofs, to diſtinguiſh them from that other more fine and ſlender Proof, which he draws from the real Preſence. He immediately produces a paſſage of <hi>Cabaſilas</hi> in <note place="margin">Lib. 10. cap. 9.</note> theſe Terms, <hi>The faithful, deſirous to ſhew their Faith, in receiving the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion do adore, bleſs, and praiſe Jeſus Chriſt as God, who is manifeſted in the Gifts.</hi> I anſwer, he ought faithfully to tranſlate this paſſage. <hi>Cabaſilas</hi> ſpeaks of the Gifts, and ſay's, <hi>That the Faithful adore, bleſs, and praiſe Jeſus Chriſt, who is underſtood in them,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. Now a man muſt be very <note place="margin">Cap. 37.</note> little converſant amongſt Greek Authors not to know, that when the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is concerning the Symbols, <gap reason="foreign">

Jeſus Chriſt then being repreſented by the Gifts, is adored according to <hi>Cabaſilas,</hi> and not the Gifts themſelves. Which is what I obſerv'd in my Anſwer to the <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would have me before I make uſe of this paſſage to conſider all that he has taken out of this Author to ſhew he believed the real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. <hi>For,</hi> ſay's he, Cabaſilas <hi>aſſerts in his Book that our Saviour Chriſt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſent in the Sacrament, and ſhews us in this paſſage we ought to adore him</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 3. cap. 8. p. 317.</note> 
                           <hi>in the Gifts. Therefore does he teach the. Adoration of the</hi> Euchariſt. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:41961:95"/> that <hi>Cabaſilas</hi> neither teaches Tranſubſtantiation nor the real Preſence, as I ſhall make appear in its place, and had the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the paſſages cited by Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> we ſhould not have been wanting to examine them, but the queſtion then in hand only concerning the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. I could not without great injuſtice tire the Reader with a long Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about the real Preſence, before I could alledge one formal paſſage touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Subject I handled.</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> tells us afterwards, that <hi>Cabaſilas</hi> blames thoſe that adore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Lib. 10. cap. 9.</note> the Conſecration the <hi>Gifts</hi> which are carri'd about, and that ſpeak to them as to our Saviour himſelf, and approves they ſhould give the ſame reſpect to the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> after its Conſecration. I anſwer, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> proſtrate themſelves before the Book of the Goſpels and ſpeak to it, as to our Saviour himſelf, and yet it cannot hence be concluded, they adore the Book it ſelf with an abſolute Adoration, as if the Book were in effect our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Cabaſilas</hi> likes they ſhould do the ſame thing in reſpect of the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Gifts, but does not approve they ſhould do it before their Conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, altho he already acknowledges them to be Types and Figures, becauſe he would have a difference made, they being not as yet the Body and Blood of Chriſt. But this is not to ſay they ought to give to the Gifts, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after their Conſecration, an honour which terminates it ſelf in them alone.</p>
                        <p>AS to what he alledges out of <hi>Simeon de Theſſalonica,</hi> we have no other <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> aſſurance of the truth of theſe paſſages than the bare word of <hi>Allatius,</hi> that is to ſay, of a paſſionate man, ready to aſſert and maintain any thing right or wrong, for the intereſt of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> We ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more of him hereafter, but in the mean time ſhall only ſay, that the words of <hi>Simeon</hi> be they what they will, do not conclude, we ought to yield the <hi>Gifts</hi> an abſolute honour, which terminates it ſelf in that Subſtance which the Prieſt carries on his head when he enters into the Church.</p>
                        <p>THE paſſage the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> quoted, as of <hi>Gabriel de Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Second part, <hi>pag.</hi> 257.</note> was more ſpecious, but becauſe <hi>Cardinal Perron</hi> (from whom 'twas borrow'd) does not recite the Greek Text, and <hi>Arcudius</hi> who relates ſome clauſes thereof, deſcribes him as a Perſon void of all kinds of Learning, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Divinity, Philoſophy, or Grammar, and that moreover the ſame <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cudius</hi> aſſures us, the <hi>Greeks</hi> do give very little honour if any at all to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament after its Conſecration, I therefore ſaid I would ſuſpend my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment till I could aſcertain my ſelf by reading the Book it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> who is ever upon his Criticiſms, and willingly paſſes over the <note place="margin">Anſwer to the 2. <hi>Treat.</hi> of <hi>Perp 2. part. cap. 8.</hi>
                           </note> matter, that he might faſten on the Perſon, imagines he has found here a luc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky occaſion to triumph over me. But I am ſorry to find my ſelf oblig'd to diſturb his Enjoyments, which I would not do, could I well avoid it. I affirm then firſt, I had reaſon to ſuſpend my Judgment, becauſe that to judge aright of the ſence of an Author, it is not ſufficient that we ſee a paſſage tranſlated into French by <hi>Cardinal Perron.</hi> For beſides that, his Tranſlations are not always very exact, as ſeveral have obſerv'd no more than thoſe of the Office of the Bleſſed Sacrament (according to their Relations that have examin'd them,) 'tis probable this paſſage of <hi>Gabriel</hi> has been already made to his hand, by Perſons unknown to us, and for whoſe Fidelity he was not willing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. In effect foraſmuch as he has not inſerted the Greek in the Margent,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41961:95"/> as he has done in the moſt part of his other Quotations, may juſtly give us a ſhrewd ſuſpition of this. Moreover we meet therein with the Term of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> himſelf confeſſes is not an uſual expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the <hi>Greeks.</hi> There is likewiſe mention therein of the Accidents of Bread which remain, which is not the uſual Style of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> I have then wrong'd no body when I ſuſpended my Judgment, but have rather done what I and every man elſe ought to do in the like occaſion. I was not oblig'd to ask Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s leave for this, altho he pretends I was; for he is not the Sovereign Arbitratour of Affairs which are treated of in the Empire of Reaſon, there being ſeveral things which paſs there, in which he takes no part.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>BUT,</hi> ſay's he, Arcudius <hi>Mr.</hi> Claude'<hi>s great Author relates ſeveral paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                           <hi>out of</hi> Gabriel <hi>which are as expreſſive as that now in queſtion.</hi> I anſwer, that what <hi>Arcudius</hi> relates obliges me yet more to ſuſpend my Judgment, becauſe that in it there are ſeveral Contradictions and manifeſt Abſurdities, as I ſhewed in my Anſwer to Father <hi>Noüet,</hi> which the Reader may conſult, if he deſires information touching this particular.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I confeſs,</hi> adds Mr. <hi>Arnaud, that having not the leaſt reaſon to doubt of the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                           <hi>Sentiment of this Author touching the paſſages produced by</hi> Arcudius, <hi>I have therefore avoided giving my ſelf the trouble to inquire after his Book.</hi> And I for my part profeſs I am not ſo eaſily ſatisfi'd, for I cannot thus take things up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on truſt. What ſhall we ſay, every one has his way, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s humour is immediately to catch hold of any thing, but mine is not ſo haſty, and indeed I never had cauſe to repent of my ſlowneſs in this particular, reckoning it to be the beſt way to prevent miſtakes. Not that I would have him put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the trouble of ſeeking after this Book of <hi>Gabriel</hi>'s, as he has proffer'd me to do, for our Diſpute may be as well carri'd on without this Archbiſhop, whofe Book, (if we will believe <hi>Arcudius)</hi> is a very extravagant one, and the Civilities of ſuch a Perſon as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is, may be expected in a weightier occaſion.</p>
                        <p>BUT as we muſt not ſuffer our ſelves to be prevailed on by his kindneſs, ſo neither muſt we ſuffer our ſelves to be run down by his Injuries. For he charges me with diſingenuouſly ſuppreſſing <hi>Arcudius</hi> his words, which would have diſcovered the true ſence of what I cited. He chages me with like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe impertinently deſigning to invalidate the Teſtimony of <hi>Gabriel</hi> by that of <hi>Arcudius.</hi> I muſt then juſtifie my ſelf concerning theſe two particulars. The firſt of which will be ſoon diſpatched by conſidering, that having in the firſt Edition of my Books only ſet down in the Margent the particular places of thoſe Authors where are to be found the paſſages I made uſe of, I have in the laſt Edition inſerted theſe paſſages themſelves in full length, according as they are in the Original. Now that very place of <hi>Arcudius</hi> in queſtion, may be ſeen there ſet down at large, together, with the Clauſe which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſay's I have ſuppreſſed. Let but any man take the pains to read the 296 page, and he ſhall find theſe very words therein, <hi>Nam etiam poſtea in elevatione Sacratiſſimae Hoſtiae quamtumvis eam non aſpiciant, quamprimum ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Sacerdos ea verba protulerit,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>ſancta ſanctis, ſtatim procumbunt &amp; cultu Latriae adorant,</hi> which are the ſame words Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> makes his <hi>efforts</hi> upon. This is then a groundleſs Accuſation, for he cannot alledge he knew not of this Edition, ſeeing he has mention'd it himſelf in the Eighth Chapter of his Seventh Book, upon occaſion of the Council at <hi>Nice.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="160" facs="tcp:41961:96"/>
                        <p>BUT, it will be demanded, perhaps why I did not inſert into the Body of my Diſcourſe theſe words of <hi>Arcudius</hi> which do ſo plainly manifeſt his meaning. I anſwer, that if I had argued on the ſence of <hi>Arcudius,</hi> I ſhould have been to blame in not alledging whatſoever might give light to this ſence. For when we would draw a true conſequence, we ought to eſtabliſh the Principle in a clear and perfect manner, to take away all occaſion of miſtakes. But Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> needs not be told what kind of Perſon this <hi>Arcudius</hi> is, being a <hi>Greek</hi> latiniz'd Prieſt, brought up at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Seminary of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> extremely paſſionate for the Intereſts of the Roman Church, having wrote a Book particularly againſt the Proteſtants, to perſwade us that the <hi>Greeks</hi> are at agreement with the <hi>Latins,</hi> as to what concerns the Sacraments in all eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Points. I cannot then otherwiſe alledge <hi>Arcudius</hi> than to confront him with himſelf concerning ſome Truths and Matters of Fact, which do now and then eſcape him, after the ſame manner as I would quote <hi>Cardinal Perron,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> himſelf, not as witneſſes that believe what I would conclude, but as Perſons who affirm things, from whence I conclude what they themſelves do not believe. And thus does Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> quote <hi>Meſtrezat</hi> and <hi>Daillé,</hi> and ſundry others of our Authors. Now 'tis evident that when the Teſtimony of an Adverſary is alledged in this reſpect, a man is not obliged to ſet down what has been his Sentiment at the bottom, nor to relate all the words which may make it known, for this piece of imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence would be good for nothing, but to tire the Reader's patience and trifle away the time. It is ſufficient if what is alledged from them be true. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> therefore has very unjuſtly accuſed me, ſeeing I publiſhed this illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration in my Anſwer to Father <hi>Noüel,</hi> which altho well known to him; yet has it not ſtopt him in his carreer, concealing my Juſtification, neither more nor leſs than if I had ſaid nothing.</p>
                        <p>IT only then remains to know whether what I alledged from <hi>Arcudius</hi> be ſufficient to conclude, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> adore not the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whatſoever the ſame <hi>Arcudius</hi> has elſewhere aſſerted. Which is what I take upon me to maintain. He ſay's, <hi>that when the Prieſt conſecrates the Gifts,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Arcud. lib. 3. cap. 21.</note> 
                           <hi>in ſaying, this is my Body, this is my Blood, he then ſhews them little or no reſpect at all, he bows not his head, neither does he adore them, nor proſtrate himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, nor lights Candles, nor makes any Reverence.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> anſwers, the queſtion concerns not the Adoration in it ſelf, but the time of the Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">Book 10. chap. 9.</note> that we muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt a voluntary Adoration and an Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Rite or Ceremony, that the firſt is one and the ſame both with the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> becauſe it chiefly conſiſts in acknowledging the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to be the Body of Chriſt with an inward Submiſſion, which both one and the other do, as ſoon as the Conſecration is performed, that as to what concerns the ſecond, the <hi>Latins</hi> immediately perform it after the Conſecration, and the <hi>Greeks</hi> later, to wit, at the Elevation of the Hoſte, which is done a little before the Prieſt diſpoſes himſelf to communicate.</p>
                        <p>THAT we may examine this Anſwer, we muſt lay aſide this voluntary Adoration of which he ſpeaks, for it has no other foundation in relation to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> than his bare word, or at moſt the Proofs he ſuppoſes he has given of their Belief touching the real Preſence; but this is what's in queſtion, and we cannot yet ſuppoſe the ſolidity of his Proofs. To colour over this pretended diſtinction of a voluntary Adoration, and an Adoration of Rite, he ſhould ſhew us that the <hi>Greeks</hi> do give at leaſt at ſome time to the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt</hi>
                           <pb n="161" facs="tcp:41961:96"/> immediately after Conſecration this honour he calls voluntary, and that in their intention, this is a ſovereign honour. But to tell us as he does that this honour chiefly conſiſts in acknowledging the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to be the Body of Chriſt with an inward reverence, and to perſwade us the <hi>Greeks</hi> do this, is a plain abuſe, for what is this but a ſetting us upon penetrating into mens hearts, and gueſſing at their thoughts? Thoſe that have this inward reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> do certainly ſhew it by ſome outward Sign, and the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſhewing none, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> cannot ground what he ſay's on any thing, unleſs it be upon ſome particular revelation he has had of this matter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>SACRANUS, Scarga,</hi> and <hi>Caucus,</hi> who lived amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> were ignorant of this pretended inward reverence, for had they known any thing of it, they would not have been ſo poſitive in aſſerting the <hi>Greeks</hi> do ſhew no Reverence, Reſpect, or Adoration to the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> after its Conſecration; nor would they call them, as they have done, Heretical, and Prophane People. Even the <hi>Greeks</hi> themſelves who anſwer'd <hi>Caucus</hi> there was no command which enjoyn'd this Adoration, knew nothing of this. This inward Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence had its reſidence and operations in their Souls, and yet they knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it; for had they known it, they would never return ſuch an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. None but Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> knew this ſecret; but if he gives us not other Proofs, it is to be feared, his voluntary Adoration will be taken for one of his own private conceits.</p>
                        <p>WE muſt come then to this Adoration of Rite, or Ceremony, which is uſed, as he ſay's, at the Elevation of the Hoſte, and ſee whether it is an Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Latria</hi> which terminates in the Sacrament it ſelf. Now I cannot but admire theſe Gentlemens Ingenuity with whom I am concerned.

                        <p>AS to <hi>Arcudius</hi>'s Teſtimony (who tells us, <hi>that the People proſtrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the ground, as ſoon as they hear the Prieſt ſay, Sancta Sanctis, Holy Things are for Holy Perſons, and that they adore the Sacrament with an Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of</hi> Latria) we need not be much concerned thereat, being a Perſon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed, and one who teſtifies of a thing whereof he is altogether ignorant, <note place="margin">Goar in not. in S.

                           <hi>Arcudius,</hi> ſay's <hi>Goar, altho a</hi> Greek <hi>knew very little of the Rites of the</hi> Greeks, <hi>being brought into</hi> Italy <hi>when he was but ten years of age.</hi> In effect what he ſay's
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:41961:97"/> concerning the Peoples proſtrating themſelves on the ground, as ſoon as they hear the Prieſt ſay, <hi>Sancta Sanctis</hi> is not true, for the Liturgy denotes this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration of the People before the <hi>Sancta Sanctis,</hi> at the ſame time as the Prieſt and Deacon adore, immediately after this Prayer, <hi>Look upon us O Lord Jeſus Chriſt our God,</hi> &amp;c. But granting it were ſo that the People proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves in the time the <hi>Sancta Sanctis</hi> was ſaid, it would not thence follow that their Adoration terminated it ſelf in the Sacrament. They would worſhip God, as does the Deacon in the words I now mention'd, <hi>O God be propitious,</hi> &amp;c. Or our Saviour in Heaven as they do in the Prayer, which I likewiſe now mention'd which precedes the <hi>Sancta Sanctis, Look down O Lord our God from the Holy Place of thy Dwelling.</hi> They proſtrate themſelves before the Images of the Saints, before the Book of the Goſpels, before the Bread when as yet unconſecrated, and yet no Body concludes hence, they adore theſe things with an abſolute Adoration. Why then will <hi>Arcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> have them to adore the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> with an Adoration terminating it ſelf in it?</p>
                        <p>BUT if <hi>Arcudius</hi>'s Teſtimony be of no validity in reference to this laſt Article, wherefore muſt it be otherwiſe in reſpect of this other Article on which I ground my Concluſion? I anſwer, for two Reaſons, the one, for that being interreſſed as he is againſt us, it is not to be imagin'd he would ſpeak any thing in our favour, unleſs the thing were ſo well known and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably true, that he could not diſguiſe it; or paſs it over in ſilence; and th'other becauſe that in effect his Teſtimony in this reſpect, agrees with the Liturgy of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which expreſſes no kind of Adoration directed to the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> immediately after its Conſecration. And there being no mention likewiſe of any ſuch thing afterwards to the end of the Office, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion I draw hence is undeniable. Had the <hi>Greeks</hi> the ſame Sentiments as the <hi>Latins,</hi> and made profeſſion of rendring the ſame Divine honours to the Subſtance of the Sacrament which are due only to the proper Perſon of the Son of God, what time could they chooſe better for the acquitting themſelves of this Duty than that in which he begins to be preſent on the Altar? When a Prince comes into a place, People are not wont to delay the ſhewing him the reſpect due to him, every one ſtands immediately uncovered in his Preſence, and thoſe Perſons that did otherwiſe would be eſteemed fooliſh and ſtupid. What likelyhood is there then, did the Greek Church believe, that immediately after the Conſecration, the Bread becomes the very Subſtance of the Body of our Lord, ſhe would defer any longer to acknowledge it to be ſo, by a Solemn Adoration? Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> muſt not tell us, that the Prieſt's mind is ſo taken up with the <hi>Idea</hi> of the Sacrifice, that it is all this while fixed in Heaven. Theſe are Reaſonings invented, expreſly to excuſe a thing which cannot be alter'd, but in truth, it is ſo natural, to Perſons that believe Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation to ſhew immediately the Signs of Adoration to that Object they have before their eyes, that notwithſtanding all theſe fine Reaſons, thoſe who compiled the Liturgy of the <hi>Greeks</hi> would never have been wanting in this particular had they believed the aforemention'd Doctrine. So that this very conſideration of the <hi>Greeks</hi> not having ordain'd any ſolemn kind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence or Worſhip to the Sacrament after its Conſecration is alone ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make us conclude what we contend for.</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> who indeed has no reaſon to reſt ſatisfi'd with his firſt Proofs, has recourſe to his Baron of <hi>Spartaris</hi> and <hi>Payſius Ligaridius,</hi> that is to ſay, to two falſe <hi>Greeks,</hi> brought up in the Faith of the Roman Church;
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:41961:97"/> and won to its intereſt, as will appear hereafter. I only wonder he is not aſham'd to bring for witneſſes ſuch kind of People as theſe are.</p>
                        <p>AS to <hi>Oderborne</hi> the <hi>Lutheran</hi> (who diſcourſing of the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> tells us, <hi>That the Prieſt leaving the Altar to ſhew the People the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>the People kneel down, and the Prieſt ſay's in the</hi> Moſcovit'<hi>s Language, Loe here the Body and Blood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt whom the Jews put to death altho innocent,)</hi> it is eaſie to perceive he is deceived in taking for an Adoration of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,</hi> a Devotion which they practiſe before its Conſecration, when the Bread is carri'd, from the Protheſis to the great Altar. There can be rais'd no ſcruple concerning the truth of this, ſeeing we have the Teſtimony of all Authors who by unanimous conſent obſerve, that this Ceremony is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the Conſecration of the Symbols.</p>

                           <hi>the People make a low bow, but in other Churches, as in thoſe at</hi> Ruſſia, <hi>they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate themſelves on the ground after the ſame manner, as if our Saviour's real Body paſſed along.</hi> We have already obſerv'd that <hi>Sacranus</hi> and <hi>Scarga</hi> do expreſly refer this Devotion to the Bread when as yet unconſecrated as well as others, and moreover add, that the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> ſhew no reverence to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament after its Conſecration. And in effect we do not find they go twice round the Church, whence it follows that <hi>Oderborne</hi> was miſtaken, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this reſpect was given the Bread after its Conſecration, for there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but one turn made round the Church, it cannot be denied but 'tis done before the Conſecration. What I ſay is ſo well known, that <hi>Allatius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf cenſures a Proteſtant named <hi>Jerom Viſcer,</hi> for ſaying, the <hi>Greeks</hi> carry the Body of our Saviour in Proceſſion twice about the Church; <hi>So far are</hi>

                           <hi>they,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>from carrying the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>twice about the Church, that on the contrary they carry it not at all, for that which they carry from the Protheſis, to the great Altar which they call the great Entry, is no more than Bread and Wine unconſecrated.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>AND theſe are Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s <hi>groſs Proofs,</hi> as he calls 'em, for I meddle not here with what he tells us concerning a Letter from Mr. <hi>Pompone.</hi> We ſhall examine that in the following Book. His fine Proofs (as he tetms them) are thoſe he draws from the real Preſence in ſuppoſing the <hi>Greeks</hi> hold it.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:41961:98"/> 
                           <hi>For,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>whoſoever believes Jeſus Chriſt to be preſent in the</hi> Euchariſt, <note place="margin">Book 10 chap. 9 pag. 76.</note> 
                           <hi>ſpeaks to him as God, implores his aſſiſtance, beggs his pardon, excites himſelf by expreſſions of confidence in him, acknowledges his own unworthineſs, and all theſe actions being external are outward expreſſions of Adoration. So that to bring Proofs of the Adoration of the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>there needs no more to be done, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to produce all the Prayers contain'd in the Liturgies which are offer'd to our Saviour after the Conſecration.</hi> But it has been already obſerved that this is one of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Illuſions, who is not willing to handle the Queſtion of the Adoration, as a means whereby to decide that of the ſubſtantial Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but rather as a Conſequence thereof; ſo that all the force of his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Proofs conſiſting in ſuppoſing the <hi>Greeks</hi> believe Tranſubſtantiation and the real Preſence, there needs no more to be done, for the overthrowing them, than to ſend him to the refutation of theſe Arguments, by which he pretends he has eſtabliſh'd his Principle; and even this very conſideration that he could not form his Proof without making this ſuppoſition, will only confirm what we maintain, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Greeks</hi> adore not the Sacrament, whence it follows they do not believe 'tis the proper Subſtance of the Son of God, for 'tis not likely a Church that holds this Opinion, would be wanting to give to the Sacrament thoſe outward expreſſions of reverence which would diſtinguiſh themſelves eaſily, from all other kinds of honour. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> furniſhes us with an example of this, on which we need only caſt our eyes, for it clearly appears by her words and actions, that the honour ſhe gives the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is a ſovereign and divine honour, ſuch as is due to God alone. Had the Greek Church deſign'd to ſhew it the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, what ſhould hinder it from doing as the Roman Church does? Would ſhe not at leaſt indeavour to imitate its example in ſeveral particulars? Why do they not carry it to the ſick with the ſame ſolemnity as thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Wherefore, I ſay, does not the <hi>Greek</hi> Church enjoyn her Children to kneel as oft as they ſhall meet the Sacrament? Why does ſhe not openly expoſe it in publick rejoycings or afflictions? Wherefore does ſhe not carry it about in Proceſſion? Why not dedicate a particular Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val to it? Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> may tell us as long as he pleaſes, <hi>That there is no natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 10. chap. 9. pag. 78.</note> 
                           <hi>coherence between theſe things and the Adoration, that the Inſtitution of theſe Ceremonies is pious and commendable, but no wiſe neceſſary, and that the Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may ſubſiſt without them, as it does in effect in all the Eaſt.</hi> When there were not a natural coherence between Adoration and each of theſe particular Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, yet would it be (me thinks) contrary to nature that the Adoration ſhould ſubſiſt ſeperated from all theſe things in general; ſeeing theſe are in a manner almoſt the ſame external marks of Divine Worſhip, which People have ever rendred to ſome viſible Object. What likelihood is there if the <hi>Greeks</hi> had the ſame Sentiments as the <hi>Latins</hi> touching this Sacrament, but they would adopt ſome one of theſe Devotions which are ſo familiar to the <hi>Latins,</hi> eſpecially thoſe that approach the neareſt their uſual Cuſtoms, and which are moreover very proper to expreſs this ſovereign honour now in queſtion, as is that ſolemn Feaſt called God's Feſtival, with all its Pomp. But ſo far have they been from imitating the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that they have on the contrary ſhewed the greateſt averſion to it, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Confeſſion of <hi>Metrophanus Citropulus</hi> made at <hi>Helmstad</hi> in the year 1625. <hi>We carry not about the Streets,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>this Holy Myſtery, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi>

                        <p>WHEREUPON a Learned man of the Roman Church being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, gave this Anſwer, <hi>That as to the carrying or not carrying of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about in Proceſſion, that was not to be much regarded, but there were ſeveral other things of greater importance touching the Sacrament to be conſidered.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THIS Perſon, although he ſpake not fully his mind, yet ſaid enough to make us underſtand him. For he means, (if I miſtake not) that did the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concern only the Feſtival of the Sacrament it ſignified little, but that the unwillingneſs theſe People ſhewed to obſerve this Feaſt, did ſufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they had not the ſame Sentiment in the main with the <hi>Latins</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> And in effect wherefore ſhould they refuſe to obſerve this Feaſt, did they believe the Sacrament to be the proper Subſtance of the Son of God, and adored it with an Adoration of <hi>Latria?</hi> Were they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of giving it too much honour? Why not conform in this particular with the Roman Church, ſeeing they were reunited to her, and had left the <hi>Greeks</hi>? Is not this an evident token, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> cannot accommodate themſelves to the Adoration practis'd by the <hi>Latins,</hi> nor conſequently to the Doctrine they teach, and on which this Adoration is eſtabliſhed.</p>
                        <p>BUT when what I ſaid ſhould have no ground, and the Adoration might ſubſiſt without theſe Ceremonies, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ought at leaſt to ſhew us they ſubſtituted ſome others equivalent to them, which were to the <hi>Greeks</hi> the ſame as thoſe we ſpeak of are to the <hi>Latins.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> takes no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this. He thinks it ſufficient, to tell me, <hi>I am fal'n into a condition void of reaſon and common ſence, that I make extravagant and ridiculous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, and that he is both aſhamed and ſorry for me, that he laughs at my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, being ſuch little Sophiſtries as are not fit to be offered by a judicious Perſon, and that my audaciouſneſs is beyond example in denying the</hi> Greeks <hi>adore the</hi> Euchariſt. Theſe are his uſual Civilities, which yet ſhall not make me change my humour. I hope he will be one day of a better mind, and to that end I ſhall deal with him, not only in a calm and gentle manner, as it becomes a man of my Profeſſion, but offer up my Prayers unto Almighty God for him.</p>
                        <p>BUT before I finiſh this Chapter, I am obliged to tell him, he could not do his Cauſe a greater Injury than to cite as he has done on this Subject of the Adoration of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> a paſſage taken from <hi>Stephen Stylite,</hi> who told the Emperour <hi>Copronymus, That the Chriſtians adore, and kiſs, the Anti-Types of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Either he has not examined this Paſſage, or his prejudice has hind'red him from obſerving what is as clear as the day, to wit, that <hi>Stephen</hi> attributes no more to the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> than an inferiour and relative Adoration, ſuch as is given to Images, the Croſs and conſecrated Veſſels, whoſe matter is not adored. And this appears through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole ſequel of his Diſcourſe. The Emperor accuſed him for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Idolater in that he adored Images. He anſwers that his Adoration
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:41961:99"/> related not to the matter of the Image, but to the Original which the Image repreſented. And to ſhew that this kind of Adoration is not Idolatry (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho addreſſed to a thing made with hands and ſenſeleſs) he alledges the example of the Croſs, holy Garments and Veſſels which are likewiſe ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and in fine that of the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> Loe here his words which juſtifie what I ſay. <hi>What crime do we commit when we repreſent by an Image the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>

                           <hi>ſhape of Jeſus Chriſt who has been ſeen, and whom we worſhip? Is this to adore a Creature, or do you think it may be truly ſaid that we adore the Matter, when we adore a Croſs be it made of what ſtuff it will? We adore the Holy Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Sacred Veſſels, without incurring any cenſure, for we are perſwaded that by Prayer they are changed into Holy Things. Will you baniſh likewiſe from the Church the Anti-Types of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe they are the Image and true Figure of this Body and Blood?

There needs little ſtrength of reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to make this Concluſion, and as little Meditation to comprehend it. We need only obſerve that this man endeavours to defend from the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Idolatry the Adoration given to Images, by the example of the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and ranks in the ſame order, the Adoration given to the Croſs, to the ſacred Veſtments, to the Veſſels of the Church, to Images, with that given to the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> We need only take notice that he calls for this effect the <hi>Eucharist, the Anti-Type, Image, and true Figure of the Body and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> whence it follows he places the Adoration of the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt</hi> in the rank of thoſe which terminate not themſelves in the Object which we have before us, but which refer to the Original they repreſent, wherein the Matter or that which is viſible is not adored; but where by means of a material Symbol, a man raiſes up his mind to the Object whoſe Symbol he beholds. In fine it needs only be obſerv'd, that if the <hi>Greeks</hi> adored the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament with an Adoration of <hi>Latria</hi> terminating it ſelf in the Sacrament, never man was more impertinent than he, in endeavouring to excuſe a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Adoration by an abſolute one, never man betrayed more his Cauſe, for beſides the Extravagancy of his reaſonings, for which he may be juſtly reproach'd, he may be likewiſe told, he falls into a new Hereſie, and horrible Impiety, making the Adoration of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to be like that of the Croſs and conſecrated Veſſels, or that of Images, whoſe viſible Subject or Matter men do not adore. Neither muſt Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> tell us he ſpeaks only of the Adoration of the Accidents, for <hi>Stephen</hi> expreſly ranks this Adoration in the number of thoſe amongſt which <hi>the viſible Matter is not worſhipped,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, means there is in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> a Subſtance which is not adored. He ſay's, <hi>they worſhip theſe Anti-Types and kiſs them.</hi> Now in the intention of the Communicants theſe acts of Adoration and kiſſing are not barely directed to the Accidents, but to the whole Subject called the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt.</hi> He ſay's, in ſhort, <hi>that in partaking of theſe Anti-Types, we obtain Sanctification,</hi> which appertains to the whole <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and not the bare Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents.</p>

I ground my ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative on the expreſs Teſtimonies of <hi>Sacranus, John de Lasko, Peter Scarga, Anthony Caucus, Francis Richard,</hi> all Roman Catholicks and Eccleſiaſticks, who lived in thoſe Places and are conſequently unreproachable Witneſſes in this particular, who all of 'em expreſly affirm the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not adore the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament after Conſecration, and reproach them with it as a capital crime and brand them in this reſpect with the name of Hereticks. I confirm this not only by the Silence of Travellers who exactly relate the Ceremonies of their Office, without obſerving this eſſential particular, but likewiſe from the proper Rituals of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and their refuſal to practiſe the chief Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies the <hi>Latins</hi> uſe to expreſs their Adoration, without ſubſtituting others equivalent to them. I farther confirm it by expreſs Paſſages taken out of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Greek Fathers, who only attribute to the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> a relative Adoration, like unto that given to Images, Temples, Croſſes, and Relicks of Saints. And yet Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> tells me, <hi>that he is both aſhamed and ſorry for me, and that my negative is the effect of a raſhneſs beyond example,</hi> and he grounds this fierce charge <hi>on voluntary Adorations and internal Venerations,</hi> which no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ever ſaw but himſelf, that is to ſay, on Chimera's with which the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of maintaining his <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>IT appears likewiſe by a Treatiſe attributed to <hi>Gennadius,</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that at the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> wherein 'twas ordain'd the Prieſts ſhall conſecrate the Body of Jeſus Chriſt with leavened Bread, and with the Azyme, every one according to the Cuſtom of his own Church, the <hi>Greeks</hi> that rejected the Union thus loudly expreſſed themſelves, ſaying, <note place="margin">Gennad. pro Concil.

                           <hi>That the Council had divided the Myſtery of the New Teſtament into two Parts, and made two Bodies of Jeſus Chriſt, the one of unleavened, and th'other of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened Bread.</hi> Which Language would be very improper in the mouths of Perſons who believe Tranſubſtantiation; for beſides that this would not be two Bodies, but one alone under the different Species, it ſhould at leaſt have been ſaid they had ſet up two Bodies, one made of leaven'd th'other of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaven'd Bread.</p>
                        <p>WE find that the <hi>Greeks</hi> in this ſame Controverſie, to ſhew unleavened Bread ought not to be uſed in this Myſtery, affirm that Leaven is the ſame thing to Bread, as the Soul is to the Body, becauſe Bread receives elevation by means of the Leaven, ſo that they call leavened Bread, living Bread, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which has Spirits, and on the contrary the <hi>Azyme</hi> dead Bread, a dead Lump, unfit to repreſent the living Body of Jeſus Chriſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they ground this Accuſation, that the <hi>Latins</hi> eat a dead Lump, inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Bread, and not the Body of Jeſus Chriſt which is of the ſame Subſtance as ours, and is not void of Soul, as taught the Heretick <hi>Apollinarius.</hi> We may find this kind of arguing in <hi>Cerularius</hi> his Letter, in that of <hi>Nicetas Pectoratus,</hi> and in the Anſwers of Cardinal <hi>Humbert,</hi> and likewiſe deſcrib'd at large in the Anonymous Author I mention'd, <hi>The Chriſtians Eaſter,</hi> ſay's he, <note place="margin">Bibl Patr.

Our Lord Jeſus Christ who is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect God and Man has two Natures, and one only Hypoſtaſis, having taken of the Holy Virgin a living Body indued with Underſtanding, and given us the Myſtery of the New Teſtament by means of perfect Bread.</hi> Suppoſing the Bread of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to be a Myſtery that repreſents Jeſus Chriſt, its Subſtance ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting, it will then be no hard matter to comprehend this reaſoning of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> for they mean, that the lump of Bread repreſents the Body of Chriſt, the Leaven his Soul, or Life, and the Salt his Underſtanding, or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, wherefore they ſay, that the Leaven ſtands for the Soul, and the Salt for the Underſtanding: So that partaking of this Bread, we myſtically eat the animate and living Body of Jeſus Chriſt, ſuch as it is in effect, and not ſuch a one as <hi>Apollinarius</hi> dreamt of. Whereas thoſe that partake of an <hi>Azyme,</hi> do only myſtically eat inanimate Fleſh. But ſuppoſe, theſe People be lieved Tranſubſtantiation, and judge then of their meaning. <hi>They that cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the</hi> Euchariſt, ſay they, <hi>with unleavened Bread eat a dead Lump,</hi> how ſo? They eat not the Subſtance of the <hi>Azyme,</hi> but that of the living Fleſh of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. <hi>They offer,</hi> ſay they, <hi>Fleſh that is dead.</hi> How ſo again, if they offer'd it in its proper Subſtance ſuch as it now is, that is to ſay living? <hi>They eat not the Body of Jeſus Chriſt which is conſubſtantial with us, becauſe they eat an inanimate Azyme.</hi> But it is falſe that they eat the <hi>Azyme,</hi> they receive only the colours and appearances of it, in the ſame manner as others take the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and appearances of leaven'd Bread. <hi>Their Sacrament is not indeed a Sacrament, differing ſo greatly from the Truth.</hi> Their Sacrament being the Truth it ſelf, it can admit of neither difference nor reſemblance. Who ſees not theſe People are unintelligible if we imagine they argue from the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Tranſubſtantiation? For if they only mean, that the matter of the Sacrament muſt be leaven'd Bread to become proper to be changed into the real Body of Jeſus Chriſt, they muſt conſider it in the time preceding the Conſecration; as for inſtance, were I to ſhew that theſe Stones are not proper to build a Pallace, I muſt conſider them in the time preceding the Building. Common ſence leads us to this. But theſe People on the contrary are wont almoſt always to conſider it in the time which follows the Conſecration. <hi>You partake,</hi> ſay's <hi>Nicetas, of an inanimate Azyme, you offer to God an Azyme, being the dead Bread of the Jews; You are fed from the Hebrews Table, and not from the living and rational Table of the Lord. You communicate with the Jews,</hi> ſay's <hi>Cerularius, you eat a dead Lump,</hi> ſay's the Author of the Treatiſe of the <note place="margin">Auctar. Com. bef. Tom. 2 in not ad Iſ.

He may tell us the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> may be conſider'd in two different reſpects; and that when 'tis looked upon in reference to its external Vail, 'tis called a Figure and Bread, and yet the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Tranſubſtantiation receive no prejudice thereby. But this will not ſatisfie the World, for 'tis plainly apparent, the ſence of <hi>Nicetas</hi> and other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors reaches farther than this; for to ſay, we offer dead Bread, unleavened Bread, and figuratively eat it as the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, that our Saviour gave Bread to his Diſciples, that he told them 'twas Bread he gave them, that this Bread, ſhould ſignifie his Body, the Leaven his Soul, and the Salt his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this is not a bare conſideration of ſimple Accidents. But 'tis on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſuppoſe, that the Bread remains, for we can neither offer, nor eat, dead Bread, a dead Lump, unleavened Bread, the figurative Bread of the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, if it does not remain Bread in its real Subſtance. The Bread can neither ſtand for the Body, nor the Leaven for the Soul, nor the Salt for the Underſtanding, if in effect this Bread, this Leaven and Salt do not any longer ſubſiſt, but give place to the Body, Soul, and Underſtanding of Jeſus Chriſt. Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> may tell us, if he pleaſes, that <hi>Agapius</hi> his Monk of Mount <hi>Athos,</hi> who taught Tranſubſtantiation makes uſe of this way of ſpeaking, that the <hi>Euchariſt is to us in the ſtead of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> wee ſhall find he is a Perſon that would not wholly eſtrange himſelf from the expreſſions of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> if it be true that he received the Doctrine of the <hi>Latins.</hi> But we muſt go on with our proofs.</p>
                        <p>OUR Fifteenth Proof, ſhall be drawn from the little care the <hi>Greeks</hi> take to preſerve the Subſtance of the Sacrament after its Conſecration. For it is not to be imagin'd ſuppoſing their Belief to be the ſame with that of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they would be ſo neglectful of it, and diſreſpectful to it as they are. I have already related in my Anſwer to the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> what Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Humbert</hi> wrote from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> touching their Cuſtom of burying under Ground the remains of the Communion, and letting fall the Crums thereof, without troubling themſelves about them. <hi>When you break,</hi> ſay's <note place="margin">Humbert. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tr. Nic. Bib. Patr. Tom. 4. Edit. 4.</note> he, <hi>the Holy Bread, or receive it, you are not concerned at the Crums falling down on the Ground. Neither are you more careful when you wipe the Diſhes after an undecent manner, with the Leaves of Palm-trees, or Bruſhes made with Hogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briſtles. Some among you gather up the Body of Chriſt with ſo great irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that you fill boxes with it, and to prevent the ſcattering of the Crums, preſs them down with your hands. They eat likewiſe what is left of the Oblation after the ſame manner as common Bread, and ſometimes ſo much of it, till they glut themſelves with it, and what they cannot eat they bury under Ground, or throw it into Wells.</hi> He in another place ſeverely cenſures the Cuſtom of the <hi>Greeks; To bury,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>as ſome are ſaid to do, or put it in</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>THE ſame Author, ſay's likewiſe, <hi>That their Prieſts following the Cuſtom of the Jews, let their Beards grow, which are all over wet with the Lord's Blood</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Tract. contr. Bibl. Patr. Tom. 4. Arcud. lib. 3. cap. 60.</note> 
                           <hi>when they drink. Arcudius</hi> reproaches them in the ſame manner. <hi>The Greek Prieſts,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>receive the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>very undecently, for taking the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Bead they graſp it cloſe in their hands, and ſo lift it up on their heads, (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they do this as a ſign of Honour and Veneration) and having eaten the</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, <hi>and recited ſome Praiſes, they lift up their hands to their heads and ſtroke them, for it commonly happens that ſome Crums ſtick thereon. As ſoon as they have drank the Blood, they do not ſcruple to wipe their Beards with their hands, or handkerchiefs, as if they had drank common Wine; and foraſmuch as they let their Beards grow, and never cut their Mouſtaches, it frequently happens that drops of Blood fall from them on the Holy Veſtments, or Altar, and not ſeldom on the Ground.</hi> He farther adds, <hi>That the Rubrick of their Liturgy deceives them, and that theſe words ſhould be corrected, after the Priest has wiped his lips and the brims of the Sacred Chalices, with the Veyl he has in his hands, he calls the Deacon. Sacranus</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> ſay's likewiſe, <hi>That they give the Communion to the People in naſty wooden Spoons, and wipe off the Crums which ſtick thereon with a cloth, letting them fall on the Ground.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THEY are far from being ſcrupulous, and taking that care the Roman Church does, to prevent the <hi>Euchariſts</hi> being eaten by Vermin, for the Rats may run away with great pieces of it, and yet they not concerned thereat. <hi>Manuel</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> (whom <hi>Binius</hi> ranks in the Seventh Century) being askt by one of his Biſhops what puniſhment he thought a Prieſt deſerv'd, who let a Mouſe run away with the conſecrated Bread, coldly anſwered, <hi>That thoſe to whom theſe miſchances happen are not to be blamed, becauſe theſe things are uſual; Multa enim ejuſmodi ſaepe accidunt.</hi> If the like Queſtions were offer'd to a Latin Biſhop, 'tis not to be doubted but he would inſiſt on the care that ought to be taken for the prevention of theſe
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:41961:103"/> inconveniencies, and inſtead of ſlighting the matter and excuſing the Prieſt, as this Patriarch does, by ſaying this often happens, he would on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry invent all ways imaginable to prevent this from ever hap'ning.</p>
                        <p>LET Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> if he pleaſes reflect a little on all theſe things. How is it poſſible theſe People would ſhew ſo little reverence and ſo great neglect to the Subſtance of the Sacrament, did they believe it to be the proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their Saviour? They eat thereof as common Bread till they have glutted themſelves, they bury it, and caſt it into Wells, and when any Crums thereof fall to the Ground, or ſtick on their hair, they are not all concerned thereat. They ſpill the conſecrated Wine on their Beards, on the Altar, yea on the Ground, and matter it not, and their Liturgy enjoyns them to wipe their lips with their handkerchers when they have received the Communion, to which we may add what I related in the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that they let the Sacrament hang a whole year in a linnen bag on a nayl, expoſed to the mercy of worms, according to the expreſs teſtimony of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cranus,</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Gneſne.</hi> Now what congruity has all this with the belief of Tranſubſtantiation? Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> may diſtinguiſh, if he pleaſes, between the neceſſary Conſequences, and thoſe of congruity, yet all his Philoſophy falls ſhort of perſwading us that theſe practices are conſiſtent with the belief, that 'tis no longer the Subſtance of Bread, but the proper Subſtance of the Body and Blood of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall finiſh this Chapter with a paſſage taken out of <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> which ſhall be my Seventeenth Proof. This Author (who is famous amongſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> and lived in the Eleventh Century) expounding theſe words of Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Let your Converſation be honeſt among the Gentiles, that whereas they ſpeak ill of you as of evil doers, they may glorifie God;</hi> Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>ſpeaks here of the falſe Accuſations of the Heathens, and if you would know the particulars thereof, read what</hi> Ireneus <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Lyons <hi>has written touching the Martyrs</hi> Sanctus, <hi>and</hi> Blandina, <hi>and you will be perfectly informed. This in few words is an account thereof. The</hi> Greeks <hi>having taken ſome Slaves belonging to the Chriſtian Catecumeniſts, uſed great violence towards them to make them confeſs the Chriſtians Myſteries, and the Slaves not knowing what to ſay to pleaſe thoſe that ſo rudely handled them, remembred they heard their Maſters relate that the Holy Communion was the Body and Blood of Chriſt, imagining that 'twas,</hi> In effect <hi>Fleſh and Blood. Whereupon they taking this as if the Chriſtians were wont REALLY to eat and drink human Fleſh and Blood made report hereof to all the other</hi> Greeks, <hi>and by torments forced the Martyrs,</hi> Sanctus, <hi>and</hi> Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina <hi>to confeſs it. But</hi> Blandina <hi>afterwards very pertinently demanded of them, how they could imagine People who out of Devotion did abſtain from eating Fleſh (whoſe uſe was permitted them,) ſhould do any ſuch thing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THIS paſſage may be conſidered in two reſpects, either as being of St. <hi>Ireneus</hi> or <hi>Oecumenius.</hi> I know very well there are ſeveral Learned men that believe <hi>Oecumenius</hi> was miſtaken in relating this Story as if it came from Saint <hi>Ireneus,</hi> and in effect, we do not thus find it in the Letter of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of <hi>Vienna</hi> and <hi>Lyons</hi> produced by <hi>Euſebius.</hi> But in the ſecond reſpect, under which I now offer it, we may certainly conclude that 'twas the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Oecumenius</hi> himſelf. For how can we ſuppoſe he would call the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Slaves and Heatheniſh Inquiſitors a miſtake, <hi>That the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion did in effect conſiſt of Fleſh and Blood, and that the Chriſtians did really do this.</hi> Wherefore would he reckon this Errour amongſt the <hi>Slanders</hi> of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:41961:103"/> the Heathens? Wherefore ſhould he introduce <hi>Blandina</hi> refuting this Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation had he himſelf believed the Communion to be <hi>in effect and reality</hi> the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt in its proper Subſtance, and had this been the real Sentiment of his Church? How came it to paſs, he did not endeavour to mollifie and explain theſe Terms, and ſhow that <hi>Blandina</hi> was miſtaken in denying the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to be <hi>in effect and reallity</hi> Fleſh and Blood, or that what ſhe did in this caſe was only to conceal from the Heathens, the Churches Belief in this particular, or in fine that ſhe only denied it in one ſence, to wit, that it was viſibly and ſenſibly Fleſh and Blood? How happened it, he feared not leſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> amongſt whom he lived when he gave this account would not be ſcandaliz'd at it, or the weak take hence occaſion to call in queſtion the truth of the Doctrines of Tranſubſtantiation and the real Preſence? Yet does he not trouble himſelf in ſearching after mollifying Terms or Explanations, and the manner in which he has laid this down does clearly ſhew us that he did not in any ſort believe the Holy Communion to be really and in effect the Body and Blood of Chriſt, nor imagin'd, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd any thing contrary to the Doctrine of his Church, or which might be taken in an ill ſence.</p>

                        <p>I Mention'd in my Anſwer to the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> a Diſpute which aroſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> in the Twelfth Century, touching the Body of Jeſus Chriſt which we receive in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> from whence I took occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to prove the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not believe the Tranſubſtantiation of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> contents not himſelf with pretending my Proof is not good, but will needs draw a contrary Concluſion from the ſame Principle I made uſe of. It then lies upon me to examine in this Chapter two Paſſages, the one of <hi>Nicetas Choniatus,</hi> and th'other of <hi>Zonarus</hi> who both take notice of this Controverſie; and to know whether this difference do's ſuppoſe Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation or not.</p>
                        <p>I will begin with <hi>Nicetas,</hi> who lays down the Queſtion in theſe Terms. <hi>The Queſtion,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>was whether the Sacred Body of Jeſus Christ which we</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Nicet Chon. Annal. lib. 3.</note> 
                           <hi>receive, be incorruptible, ſuch as it has been ſince his Paſſion and Reſurrection, or corruptible as it was before his Paſſion.</hi> Before we go any further, we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether 'tis likely ſuch a Queſtion ſhould be ſtated in a Church that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves Tranſubſtantiation. This is a Point eaſily decided if we conſider, that thoſe that hold this Doctrine do not reckon the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to be either in a corruptible ſtate; ſuch as it was before his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or an incorruptible one, wherein it has been ſince his Reſurrection. They have invented a Third, which holds the middle between the two others, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:41961:104"/> which equally agrees with the two times, before and after his Reſurrection, which is that they call the Sacramental State, in which they will needs have this Body to lie hid under the Accidents of Bread, being inviſible and inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in it ſelf, without Extenſion, Action, or Motion, having all its Parts in one Point, and exiſting after the manner of Spirits. In this State according to them he has neither the incorruption he obtained by his Reſurrection, nor the Corruption he put on in coming into the World, but is corruptible in reſpect of the Species which encloſe him, and incorruptible by reaſon of that Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality which Tranſubſtantiation gives him. How can Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> imagine that in this Principle of the Sacramental State, there may be formed the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether he is incorruptible, ſuch as he has been ſince his Reſurrection, or corruptible as before his Paſſion? How can he conceive that Perſons who have his third State in view, and are agreed amongſt themſelves, can fall into a debate touching the two others? For it cannot be ſuppoſed the ignorance of the <hi>Greeks</hi> has bin ſo great as not to let them ſee the inconſiſtency there is between their Queſtion and the Doctrine of the Subſtantial Converſion, as it is taught by the <hi>Latins.</hi> No People can be ſo ignorant as not to know that a humane Body, ſuch as is that of our Saviour; being under the Accidents of the Euchariſtical Bread, is neither the ſame that was on the Croſs, nor that which <hi>Thomas</hi> touched when it was riſen and we muſt neceſſarily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he has neither the corruptibility under which he was before his death, nor the incorruptibility he received when he aroſe from the Sepulchre, but another incorruptibility, which comes to him from his exiſtence after the manner of a Spirit. They could not be ſo ignorant as not to know that our Saviour celebrated his Sacrament before his death, and that we celebrate it likewiſe ſince his Aſcenſion into Heaven, and that conſequently according to the Hypotheſis of Tranſubſtantiation we cannot regulate the State of his Body in the Myſtery, neither by one nor th'other of theſe two times, that is to ſay, neither by the time which preceded his death nor that which followed his Reſurrection, but we muſt take a middle time which may agree both with the one and the other, whence it plainly appears theſe People believed not Tranſubſtantiation, for had they believed it, this difference had never aroſe among them; and ſo much concerning the Queſtion in general. Let us ſee now in what manner the two Parties maintained their Opinions.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>SOME,</hi> ſay's <hi>Nicetas, aſſerted that it was incorruptible, becauſe that the Participation of the Divine Myſteries is an acknowledgment, and commemoration that our Lord died and roſe again for us, (as teaches the great Divine</hi> Cyrillus) <hi>ſo that whatſoever part we receive, we receive intirely that which</hi> Thomas <hi>handled, and that he is as it were eaten after his Reſurrection, according to theſe following words of Saint</hi> Chryſoſtom. <hi>O wonderful! he that ſits at the right hand of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is found in the hands of ſinners; and in another place, Jeſus Chriſt is a fruit which budded in the Law, ripened in the Prophets, and was eaten after its Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and he tells us afterwards, this is no other Body than that which was too ſtrong for death, and which began our Life. For as a little Leaven leavens the whole Lump according to the ſaying of the Apoſtle, ſo likewiſe this Body which God has made immortal, being in our Body changes and converts it wholly into it ſelf; ſome likewiſe alledged theſe words of</hi> Eutychius <hi>that great light of the Church, we receive the Sacred Body of the Lord intirely and his precious Blood after the ſame manner, although we receive but one part of it, for it is divided indiviſibly into all by reaſon of the mixture.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> pretends this Party ſuppoſed Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>becauſe,</hi>
                           <pb n="177" facs="tcp:41961:104"/> ſay's he, <hi>they aſſerted after St.</hi> Chryſoſtom, <hi>that our Saviour was in Heaven</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 14. pag 242.</note> 
                           <hi>and on Earth, and after</hi> Eutychus <hi>that he was diſtributed wholly and intirely to all, that is to ſay, they taught the real Preſence.</hi> But I hope he will correct his, <hi>that is to ſay,</hi> when he has conſidered that the Deſign of theſe Diſputants was only to ſhew in what reſpect Jeſus Chriſt communicates himſelf to us in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> to wit, not as being mortal and corruptible, ſuch as he was before his Paſſion, but as being riſen. So that when they ſay we receive him whom <hi>Thomas</hi> handled, him who ſitteth at the right hand of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the ſame that vanquiſh'd death, the Body which God made immortal, they do not deſign thereby to ſignifie his Subſtance, but only the State which followed his Reſurrection, as if they had ſaid, we do not ſo much receive that Body, which the Souldiers misuſed, as that which <hi>Thomas</hi> handled, not ſo much in reſpect that it was on Earth, but at the right hand of the Father, not ſo much for that it has ſuffered death, but vanquiſhed it, and that God has made it immortal, which is to ſay, in a word, that we receive him as riſen, becauſe that in this Quality he is the Principle of our Life. It is clear that this was their drift, whence there can be nothing concluded in reference to the Subſtance, for when we receive the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, not in Subſtance, but in Myſtery, yet do we receive it in reſpect of its being riſen; and receive him alſo intire, and ſo that paſſage of <hi>Eutychus</hi> will not decide our difference.</p>
                        <p>THERE need other conſiderations for this.</p>
                        <p>AND firſt it muſt be remembred that thoſe that will argue from the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis of Tranſubſtantiation, that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> muſt not attribute to it the incorruptibleneſs which comes to it from the State of his Glory, for beſides that it could not have it, as I already ſaid, at the time of the firſt Supper, ſeeing that our Saviour was not then glorifi'd, it is moreover apparent that even at this day, it is not in this State of Glory and Majeſty which it has in Heaven. They muſt then at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to it this other incorruption, which is the effect of its Sacramental State. And 'tis unto this that the Doctrine of the ſubſtantial Preſence does naturally and neceſſarily drive them. It is therein incorruptible, becauſe 'tis indiviſible and inſenſible after the manner of Spirits.</p>
                        <p>YET do not the <hi>Greeks</hi> mention one word tending to this ſacramental in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption, they ſpeak abſolutely only concerning the incorruption which follows his Reſurrection and Glorification, which is an evident token they argued not from the Principle of Tranſubſtantiation. Secondly, had theſe <hi>Greeks</hi> intended to propoſe our Saviour's Reſurrection; wherefore ſay they, that the Myſteries are a commemoration of it as well as of his death? for they might with greater ſtrength and clearneſs of reaſon affirm, that ſeeing 'tis the proper Subſtance of the Body that is riſen, it can be no more either paſſible or corruptible, as it was before the Reſurrection. How comes it then to paſs they mention not a word of that which reaſon would ſuggeſt to them, ſuppoſing they believed the Converſion of Subſtances?</p>
                        <p>YET Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> tells us their reaſoning was good, <hi>and that it overthrew the whole Foundation of thoſe Hereticks, which was, that the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 3. cap. 14. pag. 241.</note> 
                           <hi>our Saviour Chriſt in a State of Death, whence they concluded he was in it only in a State of Death, in taking for their Principle that he was therein ſuch, as he is repreſented.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does not conſider, that beſides it is not true that the Adverſaries of theſe <hi>Greeks</hi> did take for their Principle that the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:41961:105"/> Body was in it, ſuch as 'tis therein repreſented, in ſuppoſing it was really in it; I ſay this would be moreover to impute to theſe <hi>Greeks,</hi> not a reaſon, but an overthrowing of all reaſon and common ſence. If we believe Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> their Adverſaries muſt have reaſoned in this manner. Jeſus Chriſt is in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> ſuch as he is therein repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; now he is therein repreſented, in a State of Death, he is then therein effectually dead. Suppoſing they believed Tranſubſtantiation, were they not very imprudent to let ſlip this firſt Propoſition, which is altogether contrary to Tranſubſtantiation in the ſence Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would have them hold it, to apply themſelves to the ſecond, which is undeniably evident. For no body ever denied, that our Saviour is repreſented in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> in a State of Death, ſeeing this Sacrament is a commemoration of his Death. But thoſe that hold the Tranſubſtantiation of the Bread into the living and glorifi'd Body of Jeſus Chriſt, may not grant that he is really in it ſuch as he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, becauſe he muſt be effectually dead, being repreſented therein as dead, which is punctually what the Adverſaries of theſe <hi>Greeks</hi> would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude. They had been then very imprudent to paſs by the firſt Propoſition of their Adverſaries Argument, on which they might defend themſelves and apply themſelves to the ſecond, againſt which there could be nothing ſaid. For as I already obſerved, it cannot be denied but that our Saviour is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> in a State of Death. But would they not likewiſe have been very impertinent to apply themſelves to the ſecond Propoſition (in aſſerting as they have done) that our Saviour is repreſented in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> in a State of Death and Reſurrection both together? What is this but to conclude, that he is then in it at the ſame time actually dead, and actually riſen by this Principle acknowledged by both Parties, <hi>that he is really in it ſuch as he is therein repreſented. The Catholicks,</hi> ſay's Mr. <hi>Arnaud, overthrew the Foundation of the Hereticks, by a Paſſage of Saint</hi> Cyril'<hi>s, in which this holy man affirms that the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>is the Confeſſion of Jeſus Chriſt dead and riſen for us. Whence they rightly concluded that he was then in it in a State of Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and conſequently in an incorruptible State.</hi> If this Concluſion be good, as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſay's it is, this is ſo too; he is then in it in a State of Death, and conſequently in a State of Corruption, for <hi>Cyrillus</hi> does as well aſſert that 'tis the Confeſſion of Jeſus Chriſt dead, as riſen; whence it follows that according to theſe People our Saviour dies and riſes again effectually in the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> And thus do they argue according to Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> Our Savio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap> is in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> ſuch as he is therein repreſented, now he is repreſented therein, not only in a State of Death but Reſurrection. He is then really in it not only dead, but likewiſe riſen again, and conſequently corruptible and incorruptible both together. This would be the moſt ſottiſh reaſoning ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, for after this manner they would as well argue for their Adverſaries as themſelves. And yet this is the arguing which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſo commends. And into theſe abſurdities and extravagancies does he lead thoſe Perſons he would have favourable to him.</p>
                        <p>YET he adds, <hi>That 'tis an eaſie matter to conclude that according to theſe Catholicks, Jeſus Chriſt was really preſent in the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>but 'tis a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to divine by what means Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>has concluded he was not in it.</hi> It is no ſuch difficult matter to know this. For if theſe People ſaid not what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſence immediately dictated to them, ſuppoſing they believed Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, but on the contrary that which even common ſence would hinder them from ſaying, it follows they had not this Hypotheſis in their Minds. Now this is what my Proof contains, for it ſhews that what they ſaid would
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:41961:105"/> be an extravagancy, and likewiſe what they ought to ſay, and have not ſaid. For they ought to ſay that our Saviour ſince his Reſurrection can be no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in a State of Death, or paſſibility, and conſequently that being really in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> he cannot be therein corruptible, and this they have not ſaid.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>BUT how,</hi> (ſay's Mr. <hi>Arnaud,) can Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>know what they have ſaid, or not ſaid? Will he pretend that all the reaſonings of theſe Perſons are contain'd in the ſhort account this Hiſtorian gives us of this Debate.</hi> But I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to this, for I only ſay, that if the <hi>Greeks</hi> whoſe Diſpute is ſet down by <hi>Nicetas,</hi> believed Tranſubſtantiation, he would have made them reaſon after another manner than they do, he would have made them ſay what ſence and reaſon do readily ſuggeſt to People that hold this Doctrine, and not Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies, which could never enter into the mind of a man prepoſſeſſed with Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>BUT,</hi> adds he, <hi>theſe</hi> Greeks <hi>have expreſly ſaid, what Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>blames them for not ſaying. For have they not expreſſed this clearly in theſe Words,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                           <hi>that whatſoever part we receive of the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>we receive intirely Jeſus Chriſt himſelf whom</hi> Thomas <hi>handled, becauſe we eat him after his Reſurrection, which they confirmed by divers Paſſages of the Fathers, and amongſt the reſt by that of St.</hi> Chryſoſtom; <hi>O wonderful! He that ſits at the right hand of the Father is found in the hands of ſinners.</hi> I anſwer that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> comprehends not the force of an Objection but only when he pleaſes. I do not deny but that theſe <hi>Greeks</hi> ſaid, That Jeſus Chriſt is in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> as riſen, and that we receive him wholly and intire. This is the State of their Queſtion, and they prove it by Paſſages taken out of the Fathers. But I ſay that had they reaſoned on the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the ſubſtantial Converſion, they would have ſaid that Jeſus Chriſt ſince his Reſurrection can be no longer either mortal or paſſible in himſelf, that he exiſts on the Altar after the manner of a Spirit, and is conſequently incorruptible; that the ſubſtantial Converſion cannot be made in the dead and inanimate Body of Jeſus Chriſt, foraſmuch as this is a State which has ceaſed ſince ſo many Ages, and that it would be blaſphemy and horrid cruelty againſt the Majeſty of the Son of God to make him die every day really and perſonally. And this is what I ſaid in plain Terms, but Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would not underſtand me. I tell him therefore again, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſence led the <hi>Greeks</hi> to this, had their belief been the ſame as the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins.</hi> Yet you cannot find this in what <hi>Nicetas</hi> makes them ſpeak. You read indeed that whatſoever part we receive, we partake of him whom <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> handled, that is to ſay, of Jeſus Chriſt; the word <hi>Same</hi> which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has added, is of his own invention. You find there that he is eaten after his Reſurrection, and inſtead of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s <hi>Becauſe,</hi> there is in the Greek a Diminutive Particle <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, <hi>he is as it were eaten,</hi> but you find not that Jeſus Chriſt can be any more paſſible, nor that he is in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> after the manner of a Spirit, nor what a great outrage it would be to the Son of God to make him die and ſuffer perſonally again. And yet this is what ought to be ſaid according to ſence and reaſon, ſuppoſing they believed the real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and deſign'd to refute their Adverſaries.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>NICETAS</hi> continuing to relate as from the part of theſe <hi>Greeks</hi> the Paſſage of <hi>Euthychius,</hi> adds theſe words, <hi>It is as a Seal which imprints its form on the matters which receive it, and which yet remain one, after this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, without being diminiſhed or changed into thoſe things which receive the Impreſſion, altho ſeveral in number. Even as one voice alone uttered by a</hi>
                           <pb n="180" facs="tcp:41961:106"/> 
                           <hi>Perſon, and caſt forth into the Air, remains wholly intire in him that utters it, and yet is carried wholly intire in the Air to the ears of them which hear it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any of the hearers receiving more or leſs, but it remains indiviſible and wholly intire in all, when they ſhould be ſeveral thouſands in number, altho it be but one Body, for a voice is nothing elſe but verberated Air. Let no one then doubt but that after the Holy Sacrifice and Reſurrection of the incorruptible and immortal Body of our Lord, and his holy and living Blood are applied to the Anti-Types by their Conſecration, but that they do I ſay as much imprint his proper virtue, as the things I offered by way of example do, and that he fully and intirely exiſts in them.</hi> I know not what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> thinks of theſe words, but certainly he ought not to ſuppreſs them as he has done. He mentions what precedes, and follows them, but leaves out thoſe that are in the middle. 'Tis probable he could not well brook this compariſon of the Seal that imprints its Image on ſeveral things, nor that of the voice which multiplies it ſelf in the Air, without loſing its Unity, for in effect there happens no change of Subſtance neither in the Matter that receives impreſſion, nor in the Air which receives the voice, and theſe ſeveral Matters to which the Seal communicates its I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, or thoſe ſeveral parts of the Air into which the voice is carried are one and the ſame thing amongſt themſelves, and with the Seal, or the firſt Air, in reſpect of the Characters, or Articulation, but not at all in reſpect of the Subſtance; whence we may conclude the ſame thing concerning the parts of the Sacrament, which is to ſay, that the Bread altho it receives the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the virtue of Chriſt's Body, yet does it keep its Subſtance, after the ſame manner as the Body of Jeſus Chriſt retains his, the virtue remaining the ſame in all the parts of the Bread. 'Tis probable he did not like, that in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the compariſon of the Seal, <hi>Eutychius</hi> has obſerv'd, <hi>that 'tis not changed</hi> into the things to which it communicates its Characters, whence it follows, that they are not likewiſe changed ſubſtantially into him. 'Tis likely he could not well relliſh this expreſſion, that the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt <hi>are applied to the Anti-Types,</hi> and that they imprint no leſs in them their proper virtues <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, than the Seal does in things, and the voice which a man utters in the Air. In effect I am much miſtaken if this does not repreſent the Idea of a Body of Jeſus Chriſt, in virtue and efficacy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has ſo great an averſion. I am greatly deceived if theſe expreſſions be not inconſiſtent with the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or the real Preſence. For what mean this Body and Blood applied to the Anti-Types by Conſecration, and which as a Seal imprint on them their proper virtues, if we ſuppoſe theſe Anti-Types to be really changed into this Body and Blood, and become the ſame numerical Subſtance? But be it as it will, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ought not to retrench all this Diſcourſe from the midſt of the reſt, or if he deſign'd to do it, not to reproach me, for that in my Anſwer to the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> I did not mention at large the Paſſages of <hi>Nicetas</hi> and <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narus.</hi> I can eaſilier juſtifie my ſelf concerning this particular than he can himſelf, for it will appear at the end of this Chapter, that 'twould have been very advantagious to me to repreſent them at their full length, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why I did it not, was becauſe I was unwilling to tire the Reader with Paſſages which are very long, and the ſum of which may be repreſented in few words; beſides I have cauſed them to be printed at large in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of the laſt Edition of my Book. We muſt then attribute this reproach Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> makes me, to his humour and not to his Judgment, for had he taken time to conſider, he would have ſpared us the reading of ſo frivolous a matter. But when we call to mind that he himſelf has ſuppreſſed one part of <hi>Eutychus</hi> his Diſcourſe, this muſt be ſaid to be an effect of his Judgment
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:41961:106"/> and not of his humour, for he ſeems to be naturally an Enemy to Com pe diums.</p>
                        <p>IN fine <hi>Nicetas,</hi> having made the <hi>Greeks</hi> of the firſt party ſpeak their ſence, he introduces the other, and adds theſe following words; <hi>Which things being alledged by theſe, and they producing ſeveral other Testimonies of the Church, the others replied on the contrary, That the Myſtery is not an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Reſurrection, but only a Sacrifice, and conſequently is corruptible, being without Soul or Underſtanding, and that the Communicant does not receive Jeſus Christ intire, but in part. For were it,</hi> ſay they, <hi>incorruptible, it would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with Spirit, it would be alive, it could neither be touched, ſeen, nor chewed with the Teeth, and in its cutting it would be inſenſible of pain.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>TO know whether theſe People believed Tranſubſtantiation, or the real Preſence, we need only inquire whether they had common ſence, for unleſs they were deprived of it, they could never believe that the Subſtance of the Bread is changed into the dead and inanimate Body of our Lord, which is ſeen, handled, cut, and chewed with the teeth, and which altho inanimate, yet is grieved and pain'd to ſee it ſelf thus uſed. If Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> can make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this he may make us believe any thing. How apparently impious and contradictory would this their Opinion be to expoſe our Saviour again to grief and pain; to imagine they ſee him and chew him with their teeth, and cut his fleſh in pieces, that every one may partake thereof; to believe he is without Life and Soul <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, and yet that he is pained and grieved, <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>.</p>
                        <p>BUT It will be perhaps then demanded what is their ſence, ſeeing Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> aſſures us, That all this would be ridiculous, if we underſtand it as meant of Bread, which is only the Figure of our Saviour, and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains only his virtue. I anſwer, 'tis no hard matter to give their words a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſence in ſuppoſing they only believe a change of Myſtery and Virtue, for they mean that we receive Jeſus Chriſt in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> as dead and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crific'd for us, and that for to thus repreſent him the Symbols are taken from the number of thoſe things which have neither Life nor Underſtanding, from amongſt thoſe things (I ſay) which we ſee, handle and chew with our teeth, and which relate to the firſt viſible State of Jeſus Chriſt, when he lived on Earth, and was ſubject to pain and miſery; whereas were he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in it in his incorruptible State, wherein he is no more viſible to our eyes, nor liable to the ill uſages of his Enemies, our Lord would without doubt employed other Symbols, wherein theſe dolours are not ſo lively repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. And as to what they ſay concerning our not receiving Jeſus Chriſt wholly entire, but in part, this ſuppoſes nothing elſe but that they believe the whole Body of the Bread receiving the impreſſion of our Saviour's virtue becomes his whole Body, and that each Particle is in effect but one part of it. 'Tis probable likewiſe they had regard to the moral Body of our Saviour which is the Church, and is repreſented by Bread, of which every one takes a part, to ſignifie that every particular Believer is not the whole Body, but one part thereof in communion with the reſt, according to that of Saint <hi>Paul, For we being many are one Bread and one Body; for we are all partakers of</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10:</note>

                        </p>
                        <p>SO that here's the Paſſage of <hi>Nicetas</hi> examin'd, and to the end it may not be thought the ſence I give it is only grounded on meer conjectures, we
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:41961:107"/> ſhall ſee immediately that <hi>Zonarus</hi> expreſſes himſelf to the ſame effect, and that theſe two Authors explain one another. And this is the reaſon Why I differ'd in this particular from Mr. <hi>Aubertin,</hi> when he thought <hi>Nicetas</hi> did not faithfully relate the Queſtion, and that in effect the Diſpute was grounded on Tranſubſtantiation, and the real Preſence. This was his conjecture, and we all know that the meer conjectures of Authors, altho otherwiſe never ſo judicious, lay not any neceſſity upon us of following them.

                           <hi>ſuffering themſelves to be too much led away by their own reaſonings, do raiſe doubts concerning the nature of the immaculate Myſteries, ſometimes maintaining the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>to be incorruptible, ſeeing it communicates to us the life immortal, and othertimes affirming it is corruptible, becauſe we chew it with the teeth and eat it. They aſſert likewiſe ſeveral other things according to their own fancy, and as it were, making a ſport and jeſt of theſe ſerious things. But as for your part, dear Brother, follow not their example, trouble not your ſelf with examining the Myſteries, leſt that curiouſly enquiring whether the Holy Communion be above cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, or whether it laſts but for a time, in truſting too much to your ſelf you exceed the bounds of Truth. For theſe kind of things are to be believed, not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned. And let not your reaſon make you ſo much a Sceptick as not to reject one of theſe Opinions as impious, and hold the other. For in examining them you will find they may be both maintain'd in a Catholick ſence. The Bread of the Protheſis, is that very Fleſh of our Saviour that was crucifi'd at the time of his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and laid in the Sepulchre. Which manifeſtly appears by what our Lord ſaid to his Apoſtles when he inſtituted the Myſteries of the New Teſtament; for in giving 'em to them, he ſaid, take eat, this is my Body which is broken for you for the remiſſion of ſins. Conſider, that if the Fleſh of our Lord had not been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible it would not have been ſubject to the corruption of Death. For that which is incorruptible, is above all corruption. The Bread then of the Protheſis is ſubject to corruption, as being the real Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, which is cut, and chewed with the teeth, for were it incorruptible it could be neither cut nor eaten; moreover be not troubled at this ſaying, nor think it hard and inſupportable, for although we ſpeak to you of corruption in this divine and dreadful Cummunion, yet is it in fine attended with incorruption. For the Fleſh of our Lord after it had yielded to death, and was laid in the Sepulchre, was not corrupted according to the ſaying of the Prophet, Thou wilt not ſuffer thy Holy One to ſee corruption, for being preſerved by the Divinity it remain'd incorruptible. So likewiſe the Bread of the Protheſis after it has been chewed with the teeth, and deſcended into the Stomach as in a Sepulchre, returns to the ſtate of incorruption according to</hi> John Damaſcene, <hi>being united to the Subſtance of the Soul. And therefore thoſe</hi>

                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> that always offers his Arguments as Decrees, ſay's, <hi>That a man need but only read theſe words, that the Bread which is offered on the Altar is that very Fleſh of Chriſt which was crucifi'd and buried, to explode the vain Arguments of Mr.</hi> Claude, <hi>and that a man who undertakes to argue againſt ſuch an Evidence deſerves not to be heard.</hi> And I paſſing by the vanity of his Diſcourſe, which ſhews how greatly 'tis his intereſt that I be not heard, do demand Publick Audience to diſcover the Nullity of his Proof. There is nothing more uſual in Eccelſiaſtical Writers then to ſay of a Subject to which the Scripture gives the name of Jeſus Chriſt, that 'tis Jeſus Chriſt himſelf.

                           <hi>SUAREZ</hi> and <hi>Vaſquez</hi> affirm the ſame thing, and were not theſe three laſt Jeſuits, I might likewiſe ſay in my turn, that here the Diſciple is at variance with his Maſters. In the third place I affirm that in the Diſcourſe of <hi>Zonarus</hi> the Term of, <hi>the ſame,</hi> relates not ſo much to that <hi>of Fleſh,</hi> as that of <hi>ſacrific'd,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> renders it, and of <hi>buried,</hi> to ſignifie not the Bread is this Fleſh in propriety of Subſtance, but that it is this dead and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Fleſh; which ſhews how frivolous Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Proof is, for this can neither be the ſame death nor burial, it muſt then of neceſſity be another. In fine, 'tis but obſerving never ſo little <hi>Zonarus</hi> Diſcourſe, and we ſhall find he diſtinguiſhes the Bread from the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, for he compares the one with the other, ſaying, that as the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered death and was buried, ſo the Bread is ſubject to corruption; being chewed with the teeth, eaten, and ſent down into the Stomach, as in a Sepulchre; and that as the Fleſh of Chriſt overcame corruption, ſo in like manner the Bread becomes incorruptible, and paſſes into the Subſtance of the Soul; which ſhews that his ſence is, that the Bread is the Fleſh it ſelf of Jeſus Chriſt, not Subſtantially, but Myſtically, and conſequently this pretended E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is no more than one of his Whimſies.</p>
                        <p>IN effect, ſuppoſe that <hi>Zonarus</hi> believed Tranſubſtantiation, and that
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:41961:108"/> what he calls Bread is the proper Subſtance of Jeſus Chriſt, is it poſſible his extravagancy has lead him ſo far as to believe that this Fleſh is at firſt corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, and afterwards becomes incorruptible; that it is cut and chewed with the Teeth, and in fine reduced into the Subſtance of the Soul?

It is ſo by the change of Subſtance. Not to take notice that to eat and chew Accidents with the teeth (that is to ſay, Figures and Colours ſtript from their Subſtance) is a ſingular Fancy.</p>
                        <p>THIS Paſſage of <hi>Zonarus</hi> which I now examin'd puts me in mind of another of the ſame Authors, who was a Grecian, and famous amongſt his own People and lived about the Twelfth Century, which ſhall be my Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Proof. The Paſſage is taken out of his Commentaries on the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Apoſtles and Councils. See here what he writes on the 32. Canon of the Sixth Council <hi>in Trullo; The Divine Myſteries, I mean the Bread and Wine, do repreſent to us the Body and Blood of our Lord, for in giving the Bread to his Diſciples, he ſaid to them, take eat this is my Body, and in delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Cup, he ſaid, drink ye all of it, this is my Blood. Seeing then the Lord in his Divine Paſſion, after he had poured out his Blood, cauſed to flow from his Side pierced with a Spear, not only Blood, but likewiſe Water, the Church has therefore thought it neceſſary to mingle Water with the Wine in the Holy Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THERE may be made two important Reflections on this Paſſage; Firſt, he ſay's, the Bread and Wine do repreſent to us the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, which cannot agree with the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> unleſs forced by ſeveral Interpretations unknown to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as that by the Bread we muſt underſtand the Accidents or Appearances of Bread; and by the word <hi>repreſent</hi> an incluſive Repreſentation of the thing it ſelf. Secondly, that grounding as he does this Repreſentation of the words of Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body, this is my Blood,</hi> it is clear that he has taken them himſelf in a ſence of Repreſentation, and believed that 'twas as much as if our Saviour had ſaid, <hi>This Bread repreſents my Body, this Cup my Blood;</hi> for otherwiſe he could not ground as he has done his Propoſition, that the Bread and Cup re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Body and Blood of our Lord, on this reaſon, that our Saviour ſaid, <hi>This is my Body, this is my Blood.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THIS Paſſage ſeeming to determine the Queſtion in our favour, it will not be amiſs therefore to conſider, what may be oppoſed againſt it; to avoid its force, <hi>Zonarus</hi> makes uſe of the Term of <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which may be ſayd to be better rend'red, not <hi>repreſent,</hi> but <hi>preſent, give, communicate;</hi> and that the ſence of this Author is not, that the Bread and Wine do repreſent to us the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, as Signs and Pictures repreſent their Original, but that they preſent and communicate them to us in effect, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they contain the Subſtance of them, and that 'tis to confirm this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition he alledges the words of our Saviour, <hi>This is my Body, this is my Blood.</hi> But this evaſion will not ſerve turn, if the ſence and ſequel of <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narus</hi> his Diſcourſe be never ſo little conſider'd. His Deſign was to confute
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:41961:108"/> the <hi>Armenians,</hi> in ſhewing that there ought to be Water mingled with the Wine in the Chalice. To prove this, he aſſerts, we muſt repreſent in the Myſtery the Water and Blood which ran down the pierced Side of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour when on the Croſs, and to confirm this Propoſition, he has recourſe to this general Maxim, that the Myſteries, which is to ſay, the Bread and Wine, do repreſent the Body and Blood of our Lord. Which plainly ſhews then we muſt not tranſlate the Verb <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>preſent,</hi> or <hi>give,</hi> for why, ſay's he, the Bread and Chalice give us the Body and Blood of Chriſt; but becauſe Jeſus Chriſt has ſaid, <hi>This is my Body, this is my Blood.</hi> We muſt then put Water into the Cup, becauſe Blood and Water iſſued out from our Saviour's Side. The <hi>Armenians</hi> have ſaid on the contrary there muſt be none put in, becauſe the Lord only made mention of his Blood; that 'tis very uncertain, whether the Myſteries give us this Water which ran down from our Lord's Side; and that ſuppoſing they do give it us, yet does it not hence follow we muſt mingle Water with the Wine in the Cup, the Wine alone being ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to be tranſubſtantiated into the Blood and Water which accompanies the Blood. We muſt then neceſſarily (if we ſuppoſe <hi>Zonarus</hi> ſpeaks ſence) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Term of <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, in the ſence of Repreſentation, and then his Diſcourſe will appear rational; The Myſteries repreſent the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, as they were upon the Croſs. Now in this State there iſſued from the pierced Side of Jeſus Chriſt Blood and Water, we muſt then expreſs in the Myſtery this Circumſtance, and to expreſs it we muſt mingle Water with the Wine in the Sacred Chalice, to the end that as the Wine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the Blood, ſo the Water may repreſent this Divine Water which guſhed out together with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>I Did affirm in my Anſwer to the Perpetuity, that we donot find the <hi>Greeks</hi> do teach any of thoſe Doctrines which neceſſarily follow the Belief of the change of Subſtances, whence I concluded, there was no likelyhood they were in this Point agreed with the <hi>Latins.</hi> This Conſequence has diſturbed Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> and as he makes his own Dictates and thoſe of Reaſon to be one and the ſame thing, ſo he has not ſcrupled to affirm, <hi>That Reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects this as a ſilly extravagancy.</hi> But foraſmuch as we have often experienced <note place="margin">Lib. 10. cap. 8. pag. 59</note> that in matters of Reaſon, Folly and Extravagancy, it is no ſure courſe abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to rely upon Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s words, therefore will we again lay aſide the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:41961:109"/> Authority of his Oracles, and examine the thing as it is in it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>FIRST, The <hi>Greeks</hi> do not teach the Exiſtence of the Accidents of Bread and Wine in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> without any Subject, or Subſtance which ſuſtains them. Now this is ſo neceſſary a Conſequence of Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that thoſe which believe this laſt, cannot avoid the teaching and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of the other, ſuppoſing they are indued with common ſence. In ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it would be to charge the <hi>Greeks</hi> with the greateſt folly, to ſuppoſe they imagin'd that the proper Subſtance of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, even the very ſame Body which was born of the Virgin, and is now in Heaven, does really exiſt on the Altar being the ſame in all reſpects, as the Bread of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> does appear to us to be, that is to ſay, white, round, diviſible into little pieces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that the ſame things which, (as they ſpeak) did qualifie and affect the Bread before, do qualifie and affect the ſame Body of Jeſus Chriſt. We muſt not charge the whole Greek Church with ſuch an abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Whence it follows we muſt not attribute to her the belief of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation; for did ſhe make profeſſion of believing and teaching it, ſhe would teach likewiſe the exiſtence of Accidents without a Subject; theſe two Doctrines being ſo cloſely linked together, that 'tis impoſſible to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them unleſs they fall upon this fancy, that the Accidents of Bread do exiſt in the Body it ſelf of Jeſus Chriſt, or this other, namely, that which appears in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is not really the Accidents of Bread, but falſe appearances, and pure Phantaſms which deceive our ſences, which is no leſs abſurd, nor leſs contrary to the Doctrine of the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>SECONDLY, Neither do we find that they teach what the <hi>Latins</hi> call the <hi>Concomitancy,</hi> which is to ſay, that the Body and Blood are equally contained under each Species; but we find on the contrary, that they eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the neceſſity of communicating of both kinds, and ground it on the neceſſity there is of receiving the Body and Blood of Chriſt, as will appear in the Sequel of this Chapter; which is directly oppoſite to this <hi>Concomitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> Yet is it not to be imagined but that thoſe People who believe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Subſtances, do at the ſame time eſtabliſh this other Doctrine. For if we ſuppoſe as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does, that we receive with the mouths of our Bodies, this ſame Subſtance of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, which he had when on Earth, and has ſtill in Heaven, it is not poſſible to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate in ſuch a manner his Blood from his Body, and his Body from his Blood, as to reckon the Body to be contain'd in the only Species of Bread, and the Blood in the only Species of the Wine, ſeeing 'tis true that this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration cannot be conceived without breaking the Unity of the Life which is in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>THIRDLY, Neither do we find the <hi>Greeks</hi> have ever applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſhew, how 'tis poſſible for our Lord's Body to exiſt in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> ſtript of its proper and natural Figure, deprived of its dimenſions, impalpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, indiviſible, without motion and action, which is moreover another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
                        <p>FOURTHLY, We do not find the <hi>Greeks</hi> do in any ſort trouble themſelves, touching the nouriſhment, our Bodies receive when they partake of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and yet is it certain that if we ſuppoſe they believed Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation 'tis impoſſible for them to obtain any ſatisfaction touching this matter. For ſhould they deny this nouriſhment, they may be convinced of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:41961:109"/> it by experience, and if it be referred to the proper Subſtance of Jeſus Chriſt, they plunge themſelves into an Abyſs of Abſurdities and Impieties. If it be ſaid the Accidents nouriſh, beſides that common ſence will not ſuffer us to ſay that Colours and Figures nouriſh, they that affirm this do expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the deriſion of all the World, who know our nouriſhment is made by the Addition of a new Subſtance to ours. To affirm that God cauſes the Bread to reaſſume its firſt Subſtance, or that he immediately creates another, this is to make him work Miracles when we pleaſe, and to be too free in our diſpoſals of the Almighty Power of God. And therefore the <hi>Latins</hi> have found themſelves ſo perplexed, that ſome of 'em have taken one ſide, and ſome another. Some have boldly denied this nouriſhment, whatſoever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience there is of the contrary, as <hi>Guitmond,</hi> and <hi>Algerus,</hi> others, choſen rather to affirm the Accidents do nouriſh, as <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> Others have invented the return of the firſt Subſtance of Bread, as <hi>Vaſquez;</hi> and others the Creation of a new Subſtance, as <hi>Suarez</hi> and others. Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> has choſen rather to affirm, <hi>That we are nouriſhed, not with the Body of</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap 6. pag. 155.</note> 
                           <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, but after another manner known only to God,</hi> which ſhews his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity to be ſo great in this particular, that he knew not on which ſide to turn himſelf. Whilſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> poſſeſs ſo great Tranquility in this Point, that it does not appear they ever found the leaſt difficulty in it. They aſſure us the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> does nouriſh our Bodies; but they ſee none of thoſe inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which diſturb the <hi>Latins;</hi> which clearly ſhews they do not believe the Converſion of Subſtances. For did they believe it, they would not fail to ſee what common ſence diſcovers to others; and ſeeing it, how is it poſſible they ſhould expreſs no aſtoniſhment, nor any difficulty therein, or at leaſt not take that ſide which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has taken, which is to leave theſe difficulties to Almighty God?</p>
                        <p>NEITHER do we find that the <hi>Greeks</hi> do trouble themſelves about the alteration, or corruption which frequently happens in the Subſtance of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> as the <hi>Latins</hi> do, altho the former of theſe have more reaſon for it, than the latter. For the <hi>Latins</hi> take all poſſible care to keep their Hoſts from corrupting; but the <hi>Greeks</hi> on the contrary take none at all. And keeping as they do the Sacramental Bread ſprinkled with conſecrated Wine, the ſpace of a whole year, for the uſe of the ſick, it often happens that 'tis corrupted and full of Maggots, as it is obſerv'd by <hi>Sacranus,</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Gneſne,</hi> and conſequently are more expoſed to theſe inconveniencies than the <hi>Latins.</hi> Yet do they not ſeem to be concerned, nor inform themſelves whence come theſe Worms, which being as they are Subſtances, it cannot be ſaid they generate from bare Accidents. Neither can it be ſaid without blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, that they are made of the proper Subſtance of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>THIS Proof may be extended farther; for 'tis certain we do not find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> any of theſe kind of things which depend on Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation. I mean which neceſſarily and wholly depend thereon. They are in this reſpect in a moſt profound ſilence. But it's worth our while to hear Mr. <hi>Arnaud. It is indeed,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>a real truth, that the Greeks take lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 10 cap 8. p. 59.</note> 
                           <hi>notice of theſe Philoſophical Conſequences.</hi> Samonas <hi>ſpeaks occaſionally of a Body in two places, and of Accidents without a Subject, the Archbiſhop of</hi> Gaza <hi>does the ſame, but both one and the other of theſe do this by conſtraint.</hi> What ſignifies this tergiverſating, for he ought not to ſay the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſpeak but little hereof, ſeeing they ſpeak not at all of it. This <hi>Samonas</hi> and this Archbiſhop of <hi>Gaza</hi> are not Authors to be quoted, ſeeing we ſhall make it appear in its
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:41961:110"/> place, that the Book which bears the name of the firſt of theſe is deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuſpected to be counterfeit, and that the other is a Roman Proſelyte wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Intereſts of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> It is evident that to eſtabliſh a reſtriction of this Conſequence, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſhould have better Proofs. But that we may do him right, we will not conceal what he adds afterwards. I drew from the ſilence of the <hi>Fathers</hi> touching the Miracles of Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and its Conſequences, an Argument to conclude they believed it not. He anſwers, that inſtead of <hi>Fathers, I ſhould ſubſtitute the</hi> Greeks, Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <note place="margin">Ibid. pag. 63.</note> 
                           <hi>and</hi> Copticks <hi>of thoſe times, for,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>'tis certain that all theſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans believed Tranſubſtantiation, as we do, and yet take no notice of all theſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which Mr.</hi> Claude'<hi>s head is full of.</hi> This acknowledgment is ſincere, and we need deſire no more. The <hi>Greeks</hi> take no more notice of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties ariſing from Tranſubſtantiation than the <hi>Armenians</hi> and <hi>Copticks,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> grants this to be ſo undeniable a Truth, that he makes it the ground of an Anſwer.</p>
                        <p>OUR preſent buſineſs then is to know whether the Conſequence I hence draw be juſt and good. Which he conteſts me, and firſt he ſay's, that all theſe Eaſtern Churches profeſs to believe original ſin, and yet their Divines trouble not themſelves about explaining this Doctrine. He adds, <hi>that they obſerve</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid. pag 58, 59.</note> 
                           <hi>the ſame ſilence in all the Queſtions and difficulties which the</hi> Socinians <hi>propoſe against the Trinity, the Perſon of the Holy Spirit, and the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, altho theſe difficulties are as obvious and ſenſible as thoſe alledged againſt the real Preſence.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT 'tis his prejudice, and not his reaſon that has dictated to him this Anſwer. For firſt, there is a vaſt difference betwixt the incomprehenſible Myſteries reſpecting the Divinity, which being above the natural light of reaſon require a profound ſubmiſſion, and the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. The nature of the Sacraments is well known, and the matter and ſigns thereof are better known, which are Bread and Wine. Even the thing ſignifi'd, to wit, the natural Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt are not only the natural Object of Reaſon, but likewiſe of Sence, and both one and the other of theſe Faculties can judge of it, nay, they do judge of it by a ſpontaneous motion, even when we would not our ſelves. Secondly, beſides this infinite difference, which yields no room for Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s compariſon, the Point in hand concerns not the difficulties touching Tranſubſtantiation, or the real Preſence, but the Doctrines which neceſſarily attend them, and Queſtions which immediately ariſe thence of themſelves. There is a great deal of difference between theſe two Particulars. The difficulties which are raiſed againſt a Truth, are commonly falſe Conſequences which the Adverſaries draw thence; and I confeſs it would not be to reaſon aright, abſolutely to conclude that a Church holds not a Doctrine, becauſe ſhe troubles not her ſelf in anſwering all the Objections which may be made againſt it. To al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low theſe kinds of Arguments, there are diſtinctions to be made, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular circumſtances to be obſerved, without which there can be nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. But we ſpeak here of real Conſequences of a Doctrine, of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, I ſay, which immediately ſhew themſelves to the ordinarieſt capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without any great Meditation and Study. Now altho the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not apply themſelves to anſwer the Objections of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> againſt Original Sin, againſt the Myſtery of the Trinity, the Perſon of the Holy Spirit, and Satisfaction of Chriſt, being perhaps not acquainted with them, yet do we plainly ſee amongſt them the Conſequences of theſe Doctrines. They baptiſe
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:41961:110"/> little Children, and baptiſe them in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, they believe the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are conſubſtantial; they adore the Perſon of the Holy Spirit, they put their truſt in the death of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſuch like things. Wherefore ſhould it not be the ſame in reſpect of the Conſequences of Tranſubſtantiation? Is it poſſible to hold this Doctrine, without thinking at the ſame time at leaſt on ſome one of theſe Conſequences, on the actual exiſtence of a humane Body in ſeveral places, the exiſtence of this Body without its uſual Dimenſions, the concomitancy of the Body and Blood, and on the Accidents of Bread which remain after Conſecration.</p>
                        <p>THE difficulties which the <hi>Socinians</hi> object againſt the Trinity and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Doctrines mentioned by Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> are for the moſt part falſe Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which theſe Hereticks draw from theſe Doctrines. It is no wonder if almoſt all Chriſtians be ignorant of theſe Conſequences. They do not ſpring up naturally: For 'tis paſſion and blindneſs that produces them. For I call blindneſs thoſe falſe Lights which cauſe theſe Hereticks to behold that which is not. But that which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> calls the difficulties of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation are real Conſequences of this Doctrine, and acknowledged to be ſuch by them of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Let him ſay as long as he will theſe are Philoſophical Conſequences, I affirm they are not ſo Philoſophical as to hinder them from being very natural, appearing to be ſo, even to the light of common ſence. It is moſt natural for a man that believes the Subſtance of Bread ceaſes to be, to think on the Accidents which remain. It is very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for him that believes the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and his Blood to be ſubſtantially therein, to imagine that where the Body or Fleſh is, there muſt the Blood be alſo, which is called in one word the concomitancy. It is moſt natural, for him that believes that 'tis not the Subſtance of Bread that nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, to conſider what ſhould cauſe this nouriſhment. It is very natural for a man that believes the Body of our Lord to be a real humane Body, to inquire how this Body can be ſtript of the proprieties of its Nature. It is natural, when we ſee Worms which ingender in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> to inquire whence they take their matter. It is likewiſe certain that Philoſophy is not properly any more concerned in theſe Conſequences than barely to defend them, and not to illuſtrate them. And yet when they ſhould not appear in themſelves to the eyes of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and we ſuppoſe the whole Body of this Church to be in ſuch a prodigious ſtupidity, that for ſo many Ages ſince they have diſcovered nothing of themſelves touching theſe things, which would be in my mind one of the boldeſt ſuppoſitions imaginable, yet it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged they have ſeen them in the Doctrine and common belief of the <hi>Latins,</hi> who have filled their Religion with them ſince <hi>Beringarius</hi> his time.</p>
                        <p>NEITHER is it true, that 'twas mens Diſputations which occaſion'd all theſe Queſtions on the Subject of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> or diſcover'd theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences we ſpeak of. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would fain perſwade us to it, but we know the contrary, and that 'tis the very Doctrine it ſelf of Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which has produced them. For they take their birth from what our eyes ſee, and hands touch, and experiences, which cannot but be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. In effect, they are to be found more amongſt the Schoolmen than Controvertiſts, more amongſt Authors of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> than Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</p>
                        <p>THERE is ſo great abſurdity in ſaying the <hi>Greeks</hi> are ignorant of the Conſequences of the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, ſuppoſing they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:41961:111"/> it, that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſeems to be aſhamed to maintain it to the end. <note place="margin">Ibid. pag. 62.</note> He turns himſelf on another ſide, and tells us that 'tis the docility of the Faith of the <hi>Greeks</hi> which will not permit them to behold theſe difficulties. But this is very abſurdly anſwered again. For were it thus, the <hi>Greeks</hi> themſelves would at leaſt tell us ſomething of it. I mean they would tell us themſelves in ſome ſort, that they know well all theſe Conſequences, and are not ſo ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, but that they ſee ſuch and ſuch Queſtions which ariſe from the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Subſtances, but that they behold them as an Abyſs which cannot be fathomed, or to uſe Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Eloquent Expreſſion, <hi>That they ſtifle and</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                           <hi>drown all humane thoughts in the abſolute certainty of the Word of God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Authority of his Church.</hi> They would give ſome reaſon for their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and endeavour to hinder its being interpreted in an ill ſence. They would inſtruct their People in the ſame Modeſty and Docility, and obſerve, that their Conduct in this particular was more diſcreet than that of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins.</hi> And this is what the <hi>Greeks</hi> would do, did they believe Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation after this gentle and quiet manner Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> attributes to them. Yet do they not ſo much as mention theſe Conſequences or difficulties, they take no notice of their own ſilence in this reſpect. But Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſpeaks for them without any call or order from them. He tells us his Conceptions, and thoſe of <hi>Ernulphus</hi> an Engliſh Biſhop of the Twelfth Century, but not a word of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> are in ſuch an abſolute ſilence on this Subject, that this ſilence cannot come from any other cauſe than the nature of their Doctrines, which not having the Conſequences of Tranſubſtantiation, do no ways oblige them to take notice of theſe ſame Conſequences.</p>
                        <p>AND thus far I think my Argument may paſs for good in the Opinion of thoſe People that underſtand reaſon. Yet Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will have this to be <note place="margin">Ibid. pag. 59.</note> meer <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Extravagancy.</hi> And to ſhew it to be ſo, he tells us, <hi>That rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it ſelf ſhews us we muſt not diſown certain and undoubted Truths under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, they appear contrary amongſt themſelves on weak conjectures; but the certainty of theſe Truths ſhould make us conclude touching the falſity of theſe Reaſonings and pretended Contrarieties. It is,</hi> adds he, <hi>as certain a Truth as any thing of this kind can be, that the</hi> Greeks <hi>and other Eaſtern Churches do believe the real Preſence and Tranſubſtantiation, and there is nothing but may be called in queſtion upon the ſame grounds, if we may doubt of the conſent of all the Churches with the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>in this Doctrine. This is another Truth, that the</hi> Greeks <hi>take little notice of the Philoſophicl Conſequences.</hi> Whence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that theſe two Truths being equally certain, they cannot be contrary, and that they ſhew us the falſity of Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>'s Conſequence.</p>
                        <p>IT muſt be acknowledged that never man had leſs trouble to anſwer an Adverſary than Mr. <hi>Arnaud.</hi> I prove to him the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not believe Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, becauſe they make no mention of its Conſequences nor diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. He denies my Conſequence becauſe the <hi>Greeks do believe.</hi> Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation and that two Truths cannot be contradictory. It coſts little to make ſuch kind of Anſwers, and it coſts no more to tell him that if it were a certain Truth (as he affirms it is) that the <hi>Greeks</hi> believed the converſion of Subſtances, he would have no need to trouble himſelf to anſwer my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For the Queſtion being decided, there would be nothing remaining upon this account betwixt us. I believe I eſtabliſhed the Negative, which I defend a thouſand times more ſolidly, than he has proved his Affirmative; but if I pretended to elude his Arguments by ſaying, I deny the Conſequence, becauſe the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not believe Tranſubſtantiation, I ſhould be an imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:41961:111"/> Diſputer. It ſeems to me I ſhould make it appear, either that the Matters of Fact which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> propoſes are not true, or that he takes them in a contrary ſence, and draws from them falſe Concluſions; but bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſay I deny the Conſequence, becauſe it oppoſes my Theſis, which I hold for a certain Truth, this would be to make my ſelf ridiculous. I know that a man that anſwers, ſuppoſes always his Theſis to be true, and that he has li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to draw thence, if he can, where withal to ſolve the Arguments of his Adverſary, but he muſt do it in another manner, than by ſaying, I deny the Conſequence, becauſe my Theſis is true. For otherwiſe his Adverſary will tell him, and I prove that your Theſis is falſe by the very Argument I offer; ſo that this would be always to begin again. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, he does not barely propoſe his Theſis for an Anſwer, but propoſes it, as having already ſolidly eſtabliſhed it by a great number of Proofs, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that his Proofs ſurmount mine. I confeſs, that if this be his ſence, he has right to oppoſe Proof againſt Proof, and require a compariſon to be made of them, before the Reader paſſes his final Sentence. But I demand likewiſe for my part that there be comprehended in this compariſon, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> my Proofs, but all of them together, with the Anſwers which I ſhall return his to ſhew their weakneſs and inſufficiency. Which is what a judicious Reader ought to do at the end of the Diſpute, in the mean time each Proof in particular ſhould have his force, neither muſt he imagine to elude them, one after another, by barely oppoſing againſt them thoſe which ſeem to eſtabliſh the contrary. If I pretended by the only force of my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument drawn from the ſilence of the <hi>Greeks</hi> on the Conſequences of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation to acquit my ſelf of the examination of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Proofs, and end the Diſpute by this means alone, he might reaſonably bring me back to this Diſcuſſion. For this would be to err in the ſame manner as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> has done, who would decide the whole Controverſie of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> by an Argument drawn from the pretended Conſequences of a change, without any regard to our Proofs of Fact, which conclude di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly the contrary. It would ſignifie nothing for me to alledge that my method is a method of Preſcription, and not of Diſcuſſion; for this would be meer wrangling. But this is not my deſign. I propoſed to my ſelf, (having firſt eſtabliſhed by divers moſt ſolid Reaſon, that the Greeks do not believe Tranſubſtantiation,) to anſwer in its due order whatſoever Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> has offered to ſhew that the <hi>Greeks</hi> do believe it. And yet this Proof, which I here treat of, comes with the reſt into the order of the Diſpute. It hath then, as I ſaid, its particular force and weight, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> muſt not imagine to overthrow it by barely oppoſing his Proofs againſt it, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Diſpute be ended, I hope to ſhew, that what he terms Proofs, are but meer Paralogiſms and Deluſions.</p>
                        <p>TO the end the Reader may better judge of the ſolidity of my Proof, <note place="margin">Anſwer to the Sccond Treatiſe of <hi>Perp. cap. 8. pag. 442. Edit. 7.</hi>
                           </note> he muſt obſerve, that I offered it in my Anſwer to the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> only on this Ground, that there is no Law amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or general determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that eſtabliſhes Tranſubſtantiation, that none of their Councils have decided it, none of their Confeſſions of Faith comprehended it, nor any of their publick Catechiſms aſſerted it. Now when men differ touching a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, they uſually have recourſe to the place where they may moſt reaſonably expect ſatisfaction, and if it does not appear there in it ſelf, ſence obliges 'em to addreſs themſelves to its Conſequences, and if the Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do not manifeſt themſelves any more than the Fact it ſelf, they draw thence a negative Argument, which in its place, has all the force that can be
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:41961:112"/> deſired. This method have I followed in this Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> for I produce not this Argument drawn from Conſequences, till I manifeſted that the Fact it ſelf here in queſtion, that is to ſay, Tranſubſtantiation, does not appear any where amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> neither in reſpect of the Terms, nor thing which the Terms ſignifie, and to juſtifie it I have produced what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has alledged to the contrary.</p>
                        <p>IN effect, if you ſet aſide the Latiniz'd <hi>Greeks,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Beſſarion, Emanuel Calecas, Pluſiadenus,</hi> the counterfeit <hi>Greeks,</hi> ſuch as the Baron of <hi>Spartaris,</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Gaza,</hi> whom I can prove to be a Penſioner of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and others that are notoriouſly ſuſpected, ſuch as the pretended <hi>Samonas,</hi> the Monk <hi>Agapius,</hi> the ſix Prieſts of the Patriarchate of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and the Synod of <hi>Cyprus</hi> in the Year 1668. with ſome Acts that have been alter'd by the <hi>Latins</hi> already mention'd by us, all the reſt conſiſts only in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guings and Conſequences, which have even in this quality neither Evidence nor certainty, as will appear hereafter. For as to Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s vaunting, that he has ſhewed Tranſubſtantiation, hath been defined by Councils, that it is expresſly contain'd in the profeſſion of Faith ſign'd by the <hi>Sarraſins,</hi> and in the Eccleſiaſtical Writings of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> is what he ought not to affirm on ſuch ſlight Grounds, ſeeing People may be convinced of the contrary by the bare reading of theſe pretended Councils of <hi>Cyrillus, Berrhea,</hi> and <hi>Partenius,</hi> and Paſſages he produces as well of the profeſſion of Faith of theſe <hi>Sarraſin</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes, as Eccleſiaſtical Writings; for 'tis certain we find Tranſubſtantiation neither defined, nor expreſly taught therein.</p>
                        <p>THIS Belief then appearing not of it ſelf in the Greek Church, and the expreſſions ſhe makes uſe of being lyable to ſundry Interpretations, a prudent man will conſider the Doctrines which depend thereon, and which are the inſeperable Conſequences of it; for if theſe Doctrines do no more appear than the Subſtantial Converſion, this muſt be granted a new Proof which confirms the firſt, and very much helps us to make our final Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For as I ſaid, it is not poſſible that the <hi>Greeks</hi> can be in this Point a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with the <hi>Latins,</hi> without believing at the ſame time with them, that the Accidents of Bread which remain, ſubſiſt without being upheld by the Subſtance of Bread, that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is ſubſtantially preſent in ſeveral places at one time, that it exiſts in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> void of theſe natural dimenſions, and that the Body and Blood are equally found under both Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies by vertue of the concomitancy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are the neceſſary dependan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on Tranſubſtantiation, and the <hi>Greeks</hi> are ſo much the more obliged to explain themſelves, in as much as the Terms by which they are ſaid to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their Belief touching this laſt particular are equivocal, and capable of ſeveral ſences, for they ought at leaſt to ſhew hereupon what is their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So that having not done it, it is a Proof they are not agreed with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> on the principal Point of the Converſion. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, if we will believe Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> my Proof is but a fooliſh and extravagant one. He may ſay what he pleaſes, but it ſeems to me by this, that for the moſt part there is no agreeing with him under any other Terms than the renouncing of our Reaſon. But to proceed.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall add to what I have already repreſented, the Teſtimonies of ſome Modern <hi>Greeks,</hi> who have given us exact deſcriptions of their Religion, and yet not a tittle of Tranſubſtantiation, altho their deſign and occaſions which ſet them on writing, obliged them not to be ſilent on ſo important an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:41961:112"/> I might begin with <hi>Jeremias</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> for let a man read over never ſo many times his Anſwers to the Divines of <hi>Wittem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> yet cannot he find the leaſt intimation of a ſubſtantial Converſion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he ſuffers his mind to be corrupted by Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Declamations, but it will be more proper to refer this examination to the following Book, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the order and ſequel of this Diſpute will oblige us to mention it.</p>
                        <p>WE have <hi>Chriſtopher Angelus</hi> his Letter, given us by <hi>George Felavius</hi> a <hi>Lutheran</hi> Divine of <hi>Dantzic;</hi> which <hi>Angelus</hi> was a <hi>Greek,</hi> a man both pious and learned.

                           <hi>the Holy Things, draws near to the People and ſtops at the door of the Sanctuary, where at once he diſtributes to every one the Body and Blood of our Lord, that is to ſay, Bread and Wine mixed, ſaying, this Servant of God receives, in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, for the Remiſſion of his Sins, Amen.</hi>

                        <p>WE have a Confeſſion of Faith Compiled by <hi>Metrophanus Critopulus</hi> at <note place="margin">Confeſſion Cath. &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt. in Orient. Eccleſiae per Metrophanem Critopulum.</note> 
                           <hi>Helmſtat</hi> in the Year 1625. He was not long after made Patriarch of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria.</hi> There is a whole Chapter in this Confeſſion, the Title whereof is, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>of the Lord's Supper.</hi> In which having eſtabliſhed the uſe of leavened Bread, the Unity of this Bread to repreſent our Unity with Jeſus Chriſt, and one another, he adds. <hi>That the conſecrated Bread is truly the Body of Chriſt, and the Wine undoubtedly his Blood, but the manner,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>of this change is unknown and unintelligible to us. For the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of theſe things is reſerved for the Elect in Heaven, to the end we may obtain the more favour from God by a Faith void of curioſity. Thoſe that ſeek after the reaſon of all things overthrow Reaſon and corrupt Knowledge, according to the Obſervation of</hi> Theophraſtus, <hi>ſeeing then this Myſtery is really the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, 'tis therefore very pertinently called by Saint</hi> Ignatius, <hi>a remedy againſt Mortality, a Medicine that purifies us, and an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote which preſerves us from Death, and makes us live in God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>HERE we find the Bread to be really the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and that it ſuffers a change, but we find not that the Subſtance of the one is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally changed into that of another, which is preciſely the Tranſubſtantiation of the <hi>Latins.</hi> But on the contrary that the manner of this change is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us whilſt on Earth, which is to ſay, in a word he would have us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to believe a change, (for the Bread is not naturally the Body of Chriſt) but will not ſuffer us to determine the manner of it, which what is it, but a plain rejecting of Tranſubſtantiation, ſeeing that it is it ſelf the Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this manner. It will be replied that they of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> do likewiſe acknowledge Tranſubſtantiation to be an unaccountable change, that we muſt believe it without troubling our ſelves how 'tis poſſible, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has not fail'd to produce in this ſence, the Paſſage of <hi>Metropha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> which I now mention'd according to his uſual Cuſtom, which is to turn to his advantage, even thoſe things that are moſt againſt him. But there is a great deal of difference between ſaying, there is a change which makes the Bread become the Body of Chriſt, altho we know not the manner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and affirming there is a ſubſtantial change which converts the Subſtance
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:41961:113"/> of Bread into that of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, altho we know not how this comes to paſs. By the firſt we keep our ſelves in the general <hi>Idea</hi> of a change without deſcending to a particular determination. By the ſecond we deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what this change is, to wit, a change of one Subſtance into another. In the firſt, the expreſſion is ſtill retain'd which ſuppoſes the Bread remains, to wit, <hi>That the Bread is the Body of Chriſt;</hi> but in the ſecond, this expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is willingly laid aſide, becauſe it cannot be admitted but under the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Figures and Diſtinctions. The firſt is the Language of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the ſecond that of the <hi>Latins.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT before we leave this Confeſſion of <hi>Metrophanus,</hi> it will not be amiſs to make two reflexions thereon, the one, that when he eſtabliſhes the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Communion, in both kinds, he grounds it on the neceſſity of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking as well of the Body as Blood of Chriſt, and alledges for this effect that ſaying in the ſixth Chapter of Saint <hi>John, If you eat not the Fleſh of the Son</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid. cap. 91.</note> 
                           <hi>of Man, and drink his Blood, you will have no life in you.</hi> Now this reaſon manifeſtly oppoſes the pretended concomitancy of the <hi>Latins,</hi> and Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation it ſelf; for if there be made a converſion of the Bread into the proper Subſtance of the Body of Chriſt, ſuch as it is at preſent, that is to ſay, living and animate, thoſe that receive the Species of Bread do partake as well of the Blood as Body, and it cannot be ſaid, there is any neceſſity of receiving the Cup, by this reaſon that we muſt partake of the Blood, without falling into a manifeſt contradiction, which is likewiſe the reaſon wherefore in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it is believed to be ſufficient to communicate of one kind.</p>
                        <p>THE ſecond Conſideration concerning <hi>Metrophanus,</hi> is, that this Author diſcourſing, towards the end of his Chapter, of the Sacrament which the <hi>Greeks</hi> reſerve for the ſick, ſay's, <hi>That they believe, according to the Doctrine of the firſt</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                           <hi>Oecumenical Council, that the Myſtery being reſerved, remains ſtill a Holy Myſtery, and never loſes the vertue it once received. For as Wool,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>being once dyed, keeps its colour; ſo the Sanctification remains in theſe Myſteries ever indelible, and as the remains which are taken off the King's Table are always the remains of the King's Table while they laſt, altho kept ſeveral years, ſo it cannot be but that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of this Holy Myſtery, are the remains of the Body and Blood of Chriſt.</hi> Let Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> tell us ſincerely whether this be the Style of a man that believes Tranſubſtantiation, and whether he himſelf would call that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of the Sacrament, <hi>the remains of the Body and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> and compare the Sanctification which the Bread receives to the <hi>colour</hi> wherewith Wool is dyed. Whether he would ſay, that this Sanctification remains in the Myſteries, and is <hi>indelible.</hi> For 'tis certain this gives us the <hi>Idea</hi> of Bread, which, ſo remaining, yet receives an Impreſſion of Grace and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which reſides in it as in its Subject, and makes it to be the Body of Chriſt, but no wiſe tranſubſtantiated Bread. If we were to underſtand by the vertue, not an Impreſſion of the Holy Spirit in the Bread, but an Action that changed the Subſtance of the Bread into the Subſtance of the Body of Chriſt, it might then be ſaid the effect which is produced by this Action, or Converſion, remains, that is to ſay, that 'tis ever the Subſtance of the Body of Chriſt. But it could not be ſaid, as <hi>Metrophanus</hi> does, that the Action it ſelf, that is to ſay, the Sanctification, always remain'd, becauſe it would be conceived in this caſe as a momentary Action, which ceaſes to be, aſſoon as the Converſion is made. Neither could it be moreover compared to the dye which Wool receives, ſeeing Wool remains ſtill Wool in reſpect of its Subſtance. In fine, if <hi>Metrophanus</hi> means no more but that the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:41961:113"/> remains ſtill what it has been made, to wit, the Body of Chriſt, in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, there can be no reaſon given, why, being able without doubt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain himſelf eaſily, and clearly, he choſe rather to uſe obſcure and perplexed Terms, which have an Ayr wholly contrary to his Mind, and need a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary and Diſtinctions, than to uſe clear and natural expreſſions; for how many Commentaries need we to render intelligible, that this <hi>indelible</hi> San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification which the Bread receives, and is like to the dye which Wool takes, ſignifies the proper Subſtance of the Body and Blood of our Saviour?</p>
                        <p>I will finiſh this Chapter with another Proof, taken from the Form of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration which the <hi>Greeks</hi> make when they leave their Religion to embrace the <hi>Roman.</hi> One of the Articles they are made to confeſs is this, <hi>That the Body and Blood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt with his Soul and Divinity, are really, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Apud Poſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin Bibl. ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. lib. 6.</note> 
                           <hi>and ſubſtantially, in the Holy Sacrament of the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>and that there is made a Converſion of the whole Subſtance of Bread into the Body, and of the whole Subſtance of Wine into the Blood, which Converſion the Catholick Church calls Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> The Greek runs thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</p>
                        <p>HERE's clearly expreſſed the ſubſtantial Converſion, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, and Tranſubſtantiation <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, for thus do the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſpeak when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Latins,</hi> and 'tis thus they ought to ſpeak that believe this Doctrine. But why muſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> profeſs this when they change their Religion, if they held the ſame Language before? Is it uſual, when Proſelytes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to make them profeſs Doctrines common both to the Religion they forſake, and that which they embrace? Do the <hi>Greeks</hi> do ſo by the <hi>Latins</hi> that paſs over to them, and is not this a plain ſign that their former Belief touching this Point was not that of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> For 'tis to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd that this Formulary contains firſt the Symbol with the addition of the <hi>filioque,</hi> which the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not receive. Then it contains the Decrees of the <hi>Florentine</hi> Council, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> reject, and in fine the Articles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and in reſpect of this laſt part, 'tis the ſame profeſſion of Faith which them of our Communion make when they embrace that of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IT will be perhaps replied, that amongſt theſe Articles there are two, to wit, that of the Invocation of Saints, and worſhipping of Images, which there is no neceſſity of making the <hi>Greeks</hi> confeſs, ſeeing they practiſed them already in their Religion, whence it does not follow that they believed not Tranſubſtantiation, altho found expreſſed in this Form of Confeſſion, for there ought to be the ſame Judgment made of this, as of the other two Articles. But if this Anſwer happens to be approved by Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> I will tell him 'tis of no weight. For as to the Invocation, the <hi>Greeks</hi> will not practiſe it to the Saints of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which they do not acknowledge. <hi>When I enter into a Church of the</hi> Latins, ſay's <hi>Gregory</hi> the Confeſſor <note place="margin">Hiſt.

                        </p>
                        <p>IT was then moreover needful to inſert in the profeſſion of Faith this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Images. But there can be nothing alledged like this touching that of Tranſubſtantiation. There could be no reaſon obliging the Popes to require an expreſs Declaration from the <hi>Greek</hi> Proſelytes, unleſs that of this Doctrines being not taught in the Church they left, and therefore they muſt change their Faith as well as their Communion.

Commemorative, as being perform'd in remembrance of the Sacrifice once offer'd on the Croſs, according to that other expreſſion of our Saviour, do this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me. Which is what is taught by Saint</hi> Chryſoſtom, <hi>and the whole Church, ſaying, this is done in remembrance of what was done then, do this ſay's our Saviour in remembrance of me. We offer not any other Sacrifice, as did heretofore the High Prieſt, under the Old Teſtament; but we offer every day the ſame, or to ſpeak better we commemorate this Sacrifice. But we never believed Chriſt was bodily preſent in the Myſtery.</hi> Had the <hi>Greek</hi> Church believed Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, it was here a fit place to declare it, and to reply yes, we do believe
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:41961:115"/> that Jeſus Chriſt is corporally preſent in the Sacrament, inaſmuch as that the proper Subſtance of his Body lies covered under the Accidents of Bread, or ſome ſuch like equivalent thing.

Thoſe that believe the change are the Weſtern People, which adminiſter this Sacrament according to the Doctrine of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, and all the reſt hold the Sign except the Eaſtern People; For the Eaſtern Church differs from both theſe, and yet teaches a Doctrine that is eaſie, full of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and free from contradiction. She affirms then that the Biſhop, or Prieſt, in the Divine Service holds the place of Chriſt, making the Propitiation for the ſins of the People, and that by the Holy Invocation of God's Name, and mention of the Divine Words of our Saviour, the ſpiritual Grace deſcends that ſanctifies the Bread and Wine, and changes them, not into the ſenſible, but ſpiritual Body of Jeſus Chriſt. And as to thoſe that aſſert the Subſtance of Bread and Wine is changed into the natural Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, if they underſtand hereby a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural change after a ſpiritual manner, thoſe that do thus ſpeak, concur in their Opinion with the Eaſtern Church.

For the Fathers of the Eaſtern Church have been ever averſe to Novelties and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, which tend to the ruine of Souls, not only deteſting thoſe Doctrines which are heretical, and divide the Church, but which, in diſturbing its Peace, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe its Glory.</hi> The Superſcription is, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>ALTHO we learn no new thing from the Teſtimony of this Author, yet does it confirm, and illuſtrate ſeveral matters. Firſt, that the Sentiment of the <hi>Greeks</hi> touching the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> is not in any thing the ſame with that of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but a middle way betwixt the Doctrine of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi> and Proteſtants. Secondly, That although the <hi>Greeks</hi> do uſe the Term <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual manner to be conformable to the Sentiment of the Eaſtern Church. Fourthly, That thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> underſtanding it (as they do) in a ſenſible manner, the <hi>Greeks</hi> reject them and their Communion. Fifthly, To the end there may be no pretence left for cavilling on the Term of <hi>ſenſibly,</hi> in ſaying the <hi>Roman</hi> Church underſtands not that the Body of Chriſt is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and palpable in its natural form, in the Sacrament, he declares that he well knows ſhe makes uſe of other expreſſions, namely, of Accidents and Species; meaning that this is ſtill to underſtand it <hi>ſenſibly</hi> to aſſert our Saviour's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Subſtance is in this Myſtery, although covered with the Species and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of Bread. And that this is a Novelty the <hi>Greeks</hi> have ever rejected, and of which the Ancients have not made the leaſt mention. If Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> likes this let him make the beſt uſe he can of it, in the mean time we will paſs on to another Proof.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>MATTHEW Caryophilus,</hi> titular Archbiſhop of <hi>Iconia,</hi> a Latiniſed <hi>Greek,</hi> and almoſt of the ſame ſtamp and temper, as <hi>Arcudius</hi> and <hi>Leo Alla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> has publiſhed a refutation of ſome Propoſitions taken out of a Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm made by a Greek Gentleman whom he calls <hi>Zacharias Gerganus; Alla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> ſay's he was a Biſhop. But be he what he will, <hi>Caryophilus</hi> uſes him after a dreadful manner, terming his Propoſitions Blaſphemies, and calling him <hi>Serpent, Baſilisk, Wolf, the Devil's Inſtrument, worſe than the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, a Lutheran.</hi> But 'tis a uſual thing with theſe Gentlemen to load mens Perſons with Injuries, when their Doctrines agree not with theirs. They thus begin, continue, and end their Refutations. It cannot then be taken ill, if laying aſide their Injuries, I only affirm, that <hi>Caryophilus</hi> very imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently charges this <hi>Greek</hi> with his being a <hi>Lutheran;</hi> for it is apparent from the Propoſitions he recites, and what he ſay's in his Preface, that he was a true <hi>Greek,</hi> and maintain'd the Maxims of his Religion and Church; and moreover a real lover of his Country. He oppoſes (amongſt other things) the addition of the <hi>filioque,</hi> in the Symbol, and attacks the <hi>Azuma</hi> of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins.</hi> He affirms there is but one Holy Church, which is the Catholick, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical, and Eaſtern; which does not well agree with the Title he has given him of a <hi>Lutheran;</hi> and 'tis plainly ſeen he has given it him only to make him ſuſpected by his own Countrymen, and hinder us from any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by his Teſtimony.</p>
                        <pb n="200" facs="tcp:41961:116"/>
                        <p>SO that the ſingle Authority of <hi>Caryophilus,</hi> being not ſufficient to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from conſidering this Author's Teſtimony, notwithſtanding his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Lutheraniſm.

                           <hi>The Holy Communion conſiſts of two Subſtances, the one viſible, and th'other invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the viſible Subſtance is the Bread and Wine, the inviſible Subſtance is the Word of Chriſt, This is my Body, this is my Blood.</hi> The Queſtion in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute being only, Whether the <hi>Greeks</hi> believe Tranſubſtantiation, it will be therefore ſufficient for me to ſhow by this Teſtimony, that the viſible Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bread and Wine remain, ſo that I am not concerned to know in what ſence this Author calls the Words of Chriſt the <hi>inviſible Subſtance</hi> of the Sacrament. Yet will I affirm his ſence is clear enough; for in reſpect of the Bread and Wine which are in effect Subſtances, it is plain we muſt take the Term of <hi>Subſtance</hi> in its natural ſignification; but in reſpect of the Words of Chriſt, which in effect are not Subſtances, it is likewiſe appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent we muſt underſtand this expreſſion in a metaphorical ſence, ſeeing by it is meant no more, but that the internal and myſtical virtue of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is contain'd in theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> becauſe theſe words ſhew us we muſt not take theſe things as mere Bread and Wine, but as the Body and Blood of Chriſt, of which they are the Myſtery. Which is what he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands by this <hi>inviſible Subſtance,</hi> that is to ſay, the force and efficacy of the Sacrament; for had not our Saviour ſaid of the Bread, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> it would be no more than Bread, proper to nouriſh our Bodies, whereas the Faith we have in theſe words ſhews us in it another ſpiritual Subſtance, which nouriſhes our Souls.</p>
                        <p>THE LXV. Propoſition does no leſs oppoſe the ſubſtantial Converſion; <note place="margin">Ibid. Blaſ. phem. 65.</note> for it contains theſe words, <hi>That the Laity which communicate but of one only kind, receive an imperfect Communion,</hi> which is directly oppoſite to one of the neceſſary Conſequences of Tranſubſtantiation; which is the Concomitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. And to prevent any cavilling touching the ſence of this Propoſition, as if he would ſay only, that this Communion is imperfect in reſpect of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſt, who has ordain'd we ſhould partake of both kinds, and not in reſpect of the Body and Blood it ſelf; which we fully receive under one, he thereupon explains himſelf clearly in the 68 Propoſition. <hi>This is an</hi>

                        </argument>
                        <p>HAD Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> contented himſelf, (to the end he might get clear from the Confeſſion of Faith of <hi>Cyrillus)</hi> in ſaying this Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch ſtudied <hi>John Calvin,</hi> and was a great admirer of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. That his Confeſſion of Faith contradicted ſeveral Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Belief of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> that 'twas condemned by two Councils held ſince his death, and that there is no reaſon the Doctrine of the whole Greek Church (touching the <hi>Euchariſt)</hi> ſhould be determined by his opinion; had he I ſay only thus expreſſed himſelf, we ſhould not have complained againſt him, but endeavoured to ſatisfie him in every one of theſe particulars. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of containing himſelf within theſe bounds, he has faln foul on the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <note place="margin">Lib. 4. cap. 6. pag. 382,, 83.</note> of <hi>Cyrillus</hi> himſelf, whom he treats as a hireling, charging him with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving five hundred Crowns in <hi>Germany,</hi> for ſubſcribing to Articles againſt the Catholicks, as a ſacrilegious Perſon and Uſurper, who diverted the money he gathered in <hi>Candia</hi> under the name of his Patriarch <hi>Meletius,</hi> to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing the Patriarchate of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to the prejudice of another, that was elected by common conſent, as an inſatiable ambitious. Wretch, who not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the Patriarchate of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> would have that of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and which is yet worſe, as a Villain and Murtherer, who having cauſed his Predeceſſor <hi>Timotheus</hi> to be poyſoned, got afterwards Janiſaries to ſtrangle him, who aſſiſted him in this deteſtable Action. Tho I reſolved not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Paſſion, which cannot but be diſpleaſing to good Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of either Communion, yet I may tell him, that ſeeing he publiſhes theſe Accuſations againſt a Perſon that is dead, he muſt be able to prove by good Teſtimony his charge to be true, but having no better an Author than <hi>Allati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> for this, he cannot take it ill, if I affirm, his account of this Perſon to be meer Calumny and Forgery.</p>
                        <p>HE confeſſes, <hi>he relates this whole Story chiefly upon the credit of</hi> Allatius, <hi>who</hi>

                           <hi>made it his buſineſs to inform himſelf, and being a</hi> Greek, <hi>ought ſooner to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved than</hi> Dutch <hi>or</hi> Switzers <hi>Miniſters, and eſpecially than</hi> Hottinger, <hi>who is one of the moſt paſſionate Miniſters, and least ſincere Writers he ever read.</hi> Let the <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>Switzers</hi> Miniſters, and eſpecially <hi>Hottinger</hi> be what he pleaſes, what ſignifies this to the Confirmation of the Truth of theſe Accuſations, and the ſincerity of <hi>Allatius?</hi> When the Miniſters ſhall poſitively affirm any thing in favour of <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> which they cannot prove; then Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> may queſtion their Teſtimony, and term them paſſionate Perſons not worthy of credit. If <hi>Allatius</hi> relates the ſame thing otherwiſe than the Miniſters, he may ſay he is ſooner to be believed than they, and ſee what anſwer we will make him; but for <hi>Allatius</hi> to charge <hi>Cyrillus</hi> with ſuch hainous Crimes, and to authorize his Impoſtures, we muſt be told that <hi>Hottinger</hi> is no good Author, and that <hi>Allatius</hi> is more worthy of credit, this is mere mockery; For to decide the Queſtion, whether what <hi>Allatius</hi> affirms be true or fabulous, <hi>Hottinger</hi> and other Miniſters are not concerned, we are only to inquire whether <hi>Allatius</hi>
                           <pb n="202" facs="tcp:41961:117"/> cites any Witneſſes, or whether he himſelf is an Author worthy of credit. <hi>Allatius,</hi> ſay's Mr. <hi>Arnaud, has taken ſpecial care to inform himſelf.</hi> He muſt tell us then what his Informations contain, and not affirm ſuch important matters, without good Grounds. <hi>He was a Greek by Nation,</hi> very true, but a <hi>Greek</hi> that forſook his Religion to embrace the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith; a <hi>Greek</hi> whom the Pope preferred to be his Library-Keeper, a Perſon the moſt wedded of all men to the Intereſts of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> a Perſon than whom none could be more malicious againſt thoſe he took to be his Adverſaries, and eſpecially againſt <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> and thoſe called Schiſmatical <hi>Greeks,</hi> a man full of words but little ſence. His Religion and Office of Library-Keeper will not be called in queſtion by thoſe that ever heard of him. His Zeal for the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> appears in the very beginning of his Book, <hi>De per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petua conſenſione,</hi> for obſerve here how he expreſſes himſelf, in the Pope's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: <hi>The Roman Prelate,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>is independent, he judges all the World, and</hi>

                           <hi>is judged of none, we muſt obey him altho he governs unjuſtly, he gives Laws, but receives none, and changes them when he pleaſes, he makes Magiſtrates, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins Points of Faith, and orders as ſeems good to him the greateſt Affairs in the Church. If he would err, he cannot; for he cannot be deceived himſelf, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he deceive others, and when an Angel ſhould affirm the contrary, being guarded, as he is with the Authority of Chriſt, he cannot change.</hi> The ſharpneſs, wherewith he treats thoſe againſt whom he writes, ſuch as <hi>Chytreus, Creygton,</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Corfou,</hi> and ſome others, appears by the bare reading of his Writings; every period honouring them with theſe kind of Titles, <hi>Sots,</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>CYRILLUS</hi> had Adverſaries whilſt living, and after his death; but, he has had likewiſe Defenders of his Innocency, and Admirers of his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. It is the Fate of great men to be perſecuted, and thoſe that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Eaſtern Affairs, muſt acknowledge there is no place more dangerous and expoſed to more Revolutions and Tempeſts, than the Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chate of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Beſides the Traverſes, which Envy, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Intereſts ſtirred up againſt <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> he had the whole Party of the <hi>Latins</hi> and falſe <hi>Greeks</hi> againſt him, who looked upon him as an Obſtacle that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood their old Deſign, to bring over that Church to <hi>Roman</hi> See. He <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> was aſſay'd both by Promiſes and Threatnings, as <hi>Allatius</hi> himſelf acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, but they found him unmovable; and this is the real cauſe of their after hatred.</p>
                        <p>IT is certain <hi>Cyrillus</hi> had a great averſion to the Romiſh Religion, and his Inclination led him rather to the Proteſtants ſide.

And as they were not the Maſters nor Directours of his Conſcience, ſo they were never able to preſcribe him what he had to do; ſo that 'tis very unreaſonable to make them reſponſable for his Conduct in thoſe particulars. They have been no farther concerned in the Actions of this Patriarch, than this that having known him in their Countries when he was there, their acquaintance was turned into mutual familiarity, when they found him at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> But this familiarity reached no farther than the uſual Services, Perſons of merit are wont mutually to render to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, notwithſtanding the difference of their Opinions in Religion. They helpt him to Books, and to the keeping a correſpondence with Learned men. If Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> condemns this Commerce, and makes it <hi>a Myſtery of Iniquity,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Pag. 422.</note> as he is pleaſed to call it, who need be troubled thereat? Strangers at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> are not bound to give him an Account of their Friendſhips and Civilities. I do not doubt but theſe Ambaſſadours were glad to find this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch's Confeſſion to be ſo agreeable with ſeveral Doctrines which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants believe to be of great Importance, and that he had no Inclination to a Union with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Neither do I doubt but they condoled the Afflictions to which his Dignity and Virtues rendred him obnoxious, and would gladly have done him all the good offices in their power, and what is there unlawful in all this? Muſt <hi>Cyrillus</hi> therefore be one of their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or govern himſelf according to their Directions? <hi>Had they ſaid,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Pag. 420.</note> ſay's Mr. <hi>Arnaud, that they had obliged him to make a Declaration of his Faith agreeable to their Doctrine.</hi> Why would he have them acknowledge an untruth? Did ever any body ſee any thing more captious than to eſtabliſh in the form of an Anſwer from our part a falſe Foundation to build thereon an Invective? <hi>Had they ſaid, they had in fine obliged him.</hi> But ſhould they ſay they obliged him not to this Confeſſion, but that he made it according to the Dictates of his own Conſcience and Knowledge? Now this is what they are without doubt ready to affirm, ſeeing 'tis the real truth. As to his being canonized amongſt us for a Saint and Martyr (as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is pleaſed to affirm) he knows we have no ſuch power. 'Tis certain (as I already mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) his memory is ſtill precious amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as that of a Saint and Martyr of Chriſt, as I ſhall make appear hereafter, but this is not to make him one of our Saints or Martyrs.</p>
                        <p>SHOULD we preſs thoſe that judge thus of the Conſciences of other men, perhaps they would be ſtraitned to give us a reaſon for theirs, on the ſame Maxims, on which they would have that of this Patriarchs judged, and the Ambaſſadors of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi> For not to go farther, how can they in conſcience approve that their Scholars brought up in the Seminary at <hi>Rome</hi> (which were wholly their Creatures, ſent into <hi>Greece</hi> to promote the Intereſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> See) ſhould take Orders from Schiſmatical Biſhops, and afterwards be raiſed to Biſhopricks by Schiſmatical Patriarchs; that they ſhould live in their communion and dependance in the midſt of a Church in which the Pope and all the <hi>Latins</hi> are continually excommunicated on Holy Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day by the Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> where their Sacrifice is abhorred, and

                        <p>HAVING ſatisfi'd the unjuſt Accuſations of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> againſt <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillus</hi> it now remains to ſee what advantage may accrue to us by this Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch's Confeſſion, and whether the rejection he makes in expreſs Terms of Tranſubſtantiation, may be eſteemed as that of the Body of the whole <hi>Greek</hi> Church. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> tells us three things, on the diſcuſſion of which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends <note place="margin">Lib. 3. cap. 6, &amp; 7.</note> the Solution of this Queſtion. The firſt, is, that, the <hi>Greeks</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally endeavoured to deliver themſelves from the Tyranny of <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> and that in effect he was four or five times expelled the Church. The ſecond, that this Confeſſion is wholly contrary in its principal Articles to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> And the third, that it has been condemned by two Councils held by <hi>Cyrillus</hi> his Succeſſours. Which is what we are now to examine.</p>
                        <p>AS to the firſt of theſe particulars, I confeſs this Patriarch has endured ſeveral cruel Traverſes during his life, which never ended till they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured his death, but I deny 'twas his Church occaſioned him all theſe evils; It was the <hi>Latine</hi> Party and falſe <hi>Greeks</hi> which followed him with inceſſant Perſecutions. How dexterous ſoever <hi>Allatius</hi> has been in diſguiſing the <note place="margin">Allat. de Perp. Conſ. lib. 3. cap. 11.</note> Truth, yet could he not refrain here from diſcovering it: He tells us then, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> whom he calls <hi>pii homines, zealous and pious People,</hi> not being able to defend their Faith themſelves, nor carry on the neceſſary expences for this, addreſſed themſelves to other Chriſtians, <hi>and eſpecially to the</hi> Roman <hi>Prelate, by whoſe means they avoid the like Tempeſts, and ſecure their Church.</hi> He adds,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:41961:119"/> there were Perſons deputed towards <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> with an expreſs charge, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> him either <hi>by Promiſes, or Threatnings,</hi> to ſend to <hi>Rome</hi> his Confeſſion of Faith, in which he was to admit the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> and condemn the Errors of the Calviniſts, and in ſo doing he might aſſure himſelf of the aſſiſtance and favour of the Apoſtolical See. That <hi>Cyrillus</hi> anſwered, he liked well their offers, and was ready to accept their conditions, provided he might have money and be upheld in his Patriarchate. <hi>But that at length find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he kept a correſpondence both with Calviniſts and Catholicks too, theſe laſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing troubled thereat, proceeded to threatnings, ſaying, they would never ſuffer that Chair to be defiled with the Blaſphemies of the Calviniſts.</hi> What he ſay's touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Deputation is true, for the Congregation, <hi>de fide propoganda,</hi> ſent two Jeſuits to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with one, named <hi>Canachio Roſſi,</hi> charged with Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to gain <hi>Cyrillus</hi> by Promiſes or Threatnings, being required only to receive the Decrees of the <hi>Florentine</hi> Council. But what he adds concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Cyrillus</hi> his Anſwer, is a meer Calumny, for <hi>Cyrillus</hi> remained immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, notwithſtanding all theſe Sollicitations. Neither, have we any reaſon to believe any thing upon <hi>Allatius</hi>'s bare word. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> may judge as he pleaſes, yet cannot he deny but <hi>Cyrillus</hi> his Enemies, were the <hi>Latins</hi> and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniſed <hi>Greeks,</hi> and that the Tempeſts and Storms he ſuffered, and which at length overwhelmed him, came from that ſide, ſeeing, that <hi>Allatius</hi> himſelf (his own Witneſs and great Author) affirms it. <hi>Cyrillus</hi> was ever beloved and honoured by his own true Church, as appears from the care and charge ſhe was at to ſupport him, and to ſay as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> lent him money upon uſe, and that he extorted it afterwards from the Churches, which were made to obey him by the <hi>Turks,</hi> is a Story for which he brings no proof.

He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <note place="margin">Which Letter may be ſeen in its Original.</note> produces a Letter from <hi>Cyrillus</hi> his <hi>Proto-Syncellus,</hi> that is to ſay, from one of the Chief Officers in his Chamber, named, <hi>Nathanael Conopius,</hi> da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> the Fourth of <hi>July,</hi> 1638, Immediately after the death of <hi>Cyrillus.</hi> Wherein he takes particular notice that the Executioners which ſtrangled him, having parted his Garments among them, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards carried them into one of the Markets of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to ſell them, as being the Clothes of the late Patriarch, the People were univerſally ſeized with Grief, and uttered a thouſand imprecations againſt <hi>Cyrillus</hi> of <hi>Berea,</hi> calling him <hi>Villain, and Murtherer, who had diſhonoured God's Church, and not only uſurped the Throne of the Holy and Lawful Patriarch, but likewiſe put him to death.</hi> He adds that ſome of 'em, entred the Houſe of the Uſurper, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him <hi>Pilate, and bidding him give them the Body that they might bury it;</hi> and how they afterwards went to the <hi>Caimacans,</hi> and offered him a great deal of money to obtain of him the Body of their true Patriarch, but the wicked Uſurper who cauſed him to be put to death, underſtanding it, ſent to the <hi>Caimaican</hi> to tell him, that, if he gave theſe People <hi>Cyrillus</hi> his Body,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:41961:120"/> the City would certainly be in an uproar, which hindered him from granting them their requeſt. In fine, he ſays, this Uſurper ſent Slaves to take his Body, and caſt it into the Sea, but that ſome Chriſtians having taken it thence, carried it into a Monaſtery (called St. <hi>Andrews)</hi> where they privately buried it.</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> will not fail to fay, that <hi>Hottinger</hi> is a Miniſter, and one of the moſt paſſionate, and leaſt ſincere Writers, he ever read. But why muſt we rather believe <hi>Allatius,</hi> than <hi>Hottinger?</hi> The former of theſe has all the marks of a paſſionate man, who is ever upon diſguiſhing things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this laſt on the contrary (let Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſay what he pleaſes) has all the Characters of a faithful Writer, relating things according to the beſt of his Knowledge. The former of theſe is I confeſs more polite, but th'other has more ſimplicity. <hi>Allatius</hi> relates from his own head, what he pleaſes, <hi>Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinger</hi> alledges his Witneſſes, and what likelihood is there Mr. <hi>Leger</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopius</hi> whoſe Letter in its Original I have by me, invented theſe Stories thus circumſtanced as we find them, if it were moreover true, that the Greek Church reſpected <hi>Cyrillus</hi> as a Heretick, and did her utmoſt endeavours to deliver her ſelf from him. It was on the contrary the <hi>Latins</hi> and their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples who ſo ſtrenuouſly endeavoured, to get rid of a Perſon whom they could neither gain by Promiſes, nor Threatnings, and that hindred them in their great Deſign of a Re-union. It was in reference to them, that <hi>Cyrillus</hi> added at the end of his Confeſſion, <hi>We plainly foreſee, this ſhort Confeſſion, will be as a mark of contradiction to them, who are pleaſed to calumniate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute us.</hi> His Preſentiment was not vain.</p>
                        <p>AND thus much touching Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s firſt Objection. As to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, which aſſerts the principal Articles of his Confeſſion, are contrary to the Sentiment of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> I confeſs, there are ſome of 'em wherein the Doctrine of the Goſpel is more plainly aſſerted than in other Greek Books, as the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Articles, for inſtance, which treat of our Juſtification by Faith in Chriſt, of Free Will and Divine Grace, but 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they do not in the main contradict the Doctrine of the Greek Church, and may be eaſily reconciled with the Anſwers of <hi>Jeremias</hi> to the Divines of <hi>Wittemberg.</hi> The Fifteenth Article, acknowledges but two Sacraments, and <hi>Jeremias,</hi> ſay's Mr. <hi>Arnaud, openly profeſſes to hold ſeven.</hi> But I ſay the <note place="margin">Lib. 4. cap. 5. pag. 387 Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſ. cap. 9.</note> 
                           <hi>Greeks</hi> have no rule in this matter, <hi>Metrophanus</hi> acknowledges three of Divine Inſtitution, to wit, Baptiſm, the Euchariſt, and Penance, and as to the other four he affirms, <hi>They are called Myſteries improperly <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>. Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mias</hi> acknowledges ſeven, 'tis true, but he reckons properly but two to be of Divine Inſtitution, namely, Baptiſm, and the Lord's Supper; and as to the five others, he ſeems to acknowledge the Church has added them to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Sacraments. Wherefore will Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> needs have <hi>Cyrillus</hi> (who only ſpeaks of the true Sacraments inſtituted by our Saviour, and not of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Ceremonies, which are improperly called Myſteries, becauſe they have ſomething that is myſterious in them, as ſpeaks <hi>Metrophanus)</hi> to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted the Doctrine of the <hi>Greeks?</hi> Why (ſeeing he oppoſes <hi>Jeremias</hi> to <hi>Cyrillus)</hi> does he not ſincerely relate the Sentiment of <hi>Jeremias? Arcudius</hi> has dealt better in this reſpect than he, for he acknowledges, <hi>That</hi> Jeremias <hi>does</hi>

                        <p>AS to the Eighteenth Article, in which <hi>Cyrillus</hi> aſſerts, <hi>That the Souls of the deceaſed, are carried immediately into a State of Bliſs or Miſery.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid. lib. 3. cap. 6 pag. 388.</note> ſay's, he therein contradicts the general Opinion of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> touching the State of Souls after death. <hi>Hornbeck,</hi> and <hi>Chytreus,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>And all that ever treated on the Opinions of the</hi> Greeks, <hi>affirm, they admit beſides Paradiſe, and Hell, a certain dark, and doleful place, in which the Souls are purged after this life.</hi> I anſwer, the <hi>Greeks</hi> are not determinately poſitive, touching the State of the Soul after death. As to the Souls of the Faithful, there are ſome, who hold they will not enjoy the <hi>Beatifick Viſion,</hi> till after the laſt Judgment, and in the mean time, are in pleaſant and delightful places, places, exempt from all kind of ſorrows, or elſe in dark and diſmal ſhades, where they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ruminate, on the ſins they have committed, and theſe hold there are three different ranks of deceaſed Perſons, namely, the Unfaithful or Wicked, the Faithful, that dye in a State of Repentance, and perfect Holyneſs, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who notwithſtanding their Faith and true Piety, yet have committed ſeveral ſins, for which they have not ſo truely repented, as they ought. Hell is deſigned for the firſt of theſe. The ſecond, ſay they, go into places of reſt and refreſhment, and the laſt, into thoſe doleful places, where they feel the want of God's favour and illumination.</p>
                        <p>BUT we muſt not imagine this to be the ſenſe of the whole Greek Church, for there are not a few, that hold there are only two conditions of men after death, namely, that of the virtuous, and wicked, and two places, to wit, Heaven and Hell. <hi>Syropulus,</hi> relates in his Hiſtory of the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> that, the <hi>Greeks</hi> being urged by the <hi>Latins,</hi> to expreſs themſelves <note place="margin">Hiſt. Concil. Flor. Sect. 5. cap. 16.</note> plainly touching the State of departed Souls; <hi>Beſſarion</hi> declared, <hi>That the Souls of the Saints, receive the Bliſs prepared for them, and thoſe of ſinners, their puniſhments, and that it only remains, that each of theſe reaſſume their Bodies, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, the Souls of the Juſt ſhall enter into a full enjoyment of Happineſs with their Bodies, and that ſinners likewiſe with their Bodies, &amp;c. ſhall ſuffer everlaſting puniſhments.</hi> We ſee here but two States after death. We find in <hi>Allatius</hi> a paſſage of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which likewiſe aſſerts but two places. <hi>We muſt know,</hi> ſay's it, <hi>that the Souls of the Juſt remain in certain places, and</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Allat. de lib. Eccl. diſp. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>thoſe of ſinners in like manner ſeparate from them. Thoſe rejoyce upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the hope of Bliſs, Theſe lament in expectation of their torments.</hi> There is moreover a paſſage of <hi>Joſeph Briennius,</hi> which aſſerts, <hi>That, there are two</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                           <hi>places, deſigned for the entertainment of deceaſed Souls, Heaven for the Saints, and the Center of the Earth or Hell for ſinners. That the Saints are at liberty, that they have all the World, and eſpecially the Garden of</hi> Eden <hi>for their abode. That thoſe who are condemned to Hell, will not come out from their abode, till the day of Judgment, and that they cannot receive the leaſt beam of light or relaxation. For,</hi> adds he, <hi>the Saints will not enjoy eternal happineſs, nor ſinners ſuffer their everlaſting torments, before the laſt Judgement. But theſe laſt ſhall be ſhut up in the mean time in dark Priſons, under the cuſtody of cruel Devils. Sigiſmond,</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Moſcovits</hi> ſay's, <hi>They believe not there is any Purgatory, but</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Sigiſm. Com. ver. Moſcov.</note> 
                           <hi>hold, that every one after death goes to the place he deſerves, good People into a place of Serenity amongſt Angels, and the wicked into diſmal and dark ſhades, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt terrible Devils, where they expect the laſt Judgment; that the Souls of the faithful know they are in God's favour by the nature of the place they are in, and by the preſence of Angels which accompany them, and ſo the others on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Goar</hi> teſtifies that <hi>Ligaridius</hi> (a Greek Author of the Iſle of <hi>Chios)</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding <note place="margin">Jacob. Goar in notis in offic.

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:41961:121"/> the deceaſed, ſay's, <hi>They are ſung as ſign of joy, that thoſe who remain alive, may rejoyce, in that the defunct, has happily left this miſerable life, and is now in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Everlaſting Bliſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IT appears then by this diverſity, that there is nothing ſo regulated, on this Subject, amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> but that <hi>Cyrillus</hi> may aſſert the Doctrine contained in the Article before us, without contradicting the general Belief of his Church. Beſides, his Terms are not ſo ſtrict, but that they may be well accommodated, with the Sentiment of thoſe who affirm the Souls En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy not the <hi>Beatifical Viſion,</hi> or a perfect Felicity, till the laſt Judgment, and that hold, there are three States of deceaſed Perſons, for he ſay's only, <hi>That the Souls of the deceaſed are in bliſs or miſery, and aſſoon as ever they leave their Bodies, are either in Heaven, or Hell,</hi> which will bear this ſence, that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is already paſſed upon them, and that God has already ſhown them their condition, which hinders not, but it may be ſaid that the damnation of the one is not yet perfect, and the felicity of the others not yet compleated. And this ſence ſeems to be favoured by what <hi>Cyrillus</hi> adds immediately afterwards, <hi>That every one is judged, according to the condition he is in at the hour of death,</hi> which ſeems to intimate, that he would be underſtood to ſpeak only of the Judgment, and not of the full and perfect execution of this Judgment. There are two things, moſt certain in reference to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the one, that they pray for the dead, and th'other that they reject the Purgatory of the Romane Church. Now <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> touches not on the firſt of theſe, and as to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, he agrees very well therein with his own People, for he calls Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>an imagination not to be admitted.</hi> So that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> impertinently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes him of contradicting the <hi>Greeks,</hi> in the chief Articles of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
                        <p>WE come now to Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s third Objection, which conſiſts, of two pretended condemnations of <hi>Cyrillus</hi> his Confeſſion, the one under <hi>Cyrillus</hi> of <hi>Berrhaea,</hi> and th'other under <hi>Parthenius.</hi> I have already diſcourſed of thoſe two Pieces in my Anſwer to Father <hi>Nüet,</hi> wherein I have ſhewn they are ſuſpected to be fictious. But if the Reader will not trouble himſelf, with conſulting what I have elſewhere written, touching the matter, he may here behold a <hi>Compendium</hi> of my Reaſons.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. ALTHO theſe Narratives have been often printed, there has been no body yet, that has taken upon 'em to own and warrant the Truth of them to the Publick. There is one of them printed from a Manuſcript, ſent from <hi>Rome,</hi> and th'other from an Edition printed at <hi>Jaſi</hi> in <hi>Moldavia</hi> publiſhed by a certain Monk named <hi>Arſenius.</hi> It ſeems to me there ought to be greater aſſurance given than what we have already, ſeeing it is not ſufficient to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize ſo important a matter as the Determinations of two late Councils, the one in the year 1639. and th'other in 1642.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. THESE two Narratives contradict one another, the firſt of them which is publiſhed under the name of <hi>Cyrillus</hi> of <hi>Berrhaea,</hi> is ſubſcribed by ſeveral of thoſe whoſe hands are to the ſecond, and by the ſame <hi>Parthenius,</hi> to whom this laſt is attributed, and yet in the ſecond there is no mention of the firſt. The firſt expreſly anathematizes <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> and calls him an <hi>impious and wicked Perſon;</hi> The ſecond, ſay's only, <hi>There are certain Articles produced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of the Patriarch</hi> Cyrillus. The firſt condemns with an <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> theſe Articles. The ſecond ſay's, <hi>It was propoſed in the Synod, whether they</hi>
                           <pb n="211" facs="tcp:41961:121"/> 
                           <hi>ſhould be received and held for pious and orthodox Points, or rejected as being contrary to the Doctrine of the Eaſtern Church,</hi> which plainly ſhews that they that made the ſecond, knew nothing of the firſt, and yet they are both found ſubſcribed by the ſame Perſons.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. THERE is no likelihood that <hi>Metrophanus</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> who is ſaid to have been an Aſſeſſor at the firſt Synod under <hi>Cyrillus</hi> of <hi>Berrhaea,</hi> nor that <hi>Parthenius</hi> who is ſaid to have held the ſecond, would have ſo lightly and fraudulently condemned <hi>Cyrillus Lucaris,</hi> ſeeing one of 'em had been the Chief Officer of his Chamber, and th'other his Protector, and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Friend.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. <hi>ARSENIUS</hi> the Monk, from whom 'tis ſaid we have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended account of the Synod under <hi>Parthenius,</hi> and who ſent it from <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> to a nameleſs Friend at <hi>Venice,</hi> having ſtuffed his Letter with Railings againſt <hi>Cyrillus</hi> and his Confeſſion, yet mentions not a word touching its firſt condemnation under <hi>Cyrillus</hi> of <hi>Berrhaea.</hi> Which ſhews us that theſe are counterfeit Pieces compoſed at ſeveral times, and by different Perſons, who not conſulting one another, nor furniſhed with ſufficient Inſtructions, have been guilty of ſeveral Contradictions.</p>
                        <p>I will now add to what has been already ſaid, ſome other Remarks, which are no leſs conſiderable, the firſt is that when <hi>Cyrillus</hi> his Confeſſion of Faith appeared in our Weſtern Parts; the firſt Game that was played, was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, and affirm 'twas a feigned Story; but when this Shift would no longer ſerve turn, and that the thing was made evident, then an account of theſe pretended Councils appeared, which ſhows that they were ſubſtituted as a new remedy, inſtead of the other, which could be of no longer uſe. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what <hi>Parthenius</hi> is made to ſay, <hi>That there have been ſome Articles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced under</hi> Cyrillus <hi>his name,</hi> is as every man may diſcover the Style of the Weſtern People, and not that of <hi>Parthenius</hi> himſelf, who could not ſpeak after this manner, nor his Synod neither, becauſe 'twas notorious in <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> that this Confeſſion was in effect <hi>Cyrillus</hi> his own, ſeeing he offered it in a Council, and openly juſtified it before the Miniſters of the Grand <hi>Senior,</hi> in the preſence of ſeveral Ambaſſadors; and becauſe <hi>Parthenius</hi> and his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in the preceding Synod had already conſidered it, as unqueſtionably his. Moreover what likelihood is there, that <hi>Parthenius</hi> and his Council would thus groſly and ſlanderouſly imputed to <hi>Cyrillus</hi> a thing that was falſe as they do? For <hi>Cyrillus</hi> having ſaid in the firſt Article of his Confeſſion, <hi>That the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father by the Son,</hi> which is an expreſſion from which the <hi>Greeks</hi> never vary; The firſt Article of the Cenſure bears, <hi>That he aſſerted contrary to the ſence of the Catholick Church the Subſtantial and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt from the Father and the Son,</hi> which is exactly the expreſſion the <hi>Greeks</hi> abhor.</p>
                        <p>WE may add to this, that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> tells us of a Treatiſe of <hi>Payſius Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garidius</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Gaza,</hi> in which, <hi>Ligaridius</hi> diſcourſes of <hi>Cyrillus</hi> and his Confeſſion, and raiſes an Objection about it, which he himſelf anſwers, ſaying, <hi>That, ſeveral boubted of the truth of this Piece, and that ſhould it be true, yet one Swallow does not make a Summer;</hi> but he makes no mention of theſe two pretended Cenſures, which without doubt he would never have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, being (as he is) a man full of Zeal for the intereſts of the Roman Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, were they acknowledged to be good and Authentick Acts in the Greek
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:41961:122"/> Church. I might ſay the ſame thing of the <hi>Barons</hi> of <hi>Spartaris,</hi> did it not elſewhere appear, that he was a Perſon of ſmall Knowledge in the Affairs of the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>HEYDANUS</hi> (a Dutch Profeſſour of Divinity) relates, that in the year 1643. The News being come to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that, this pretended <note place="margin">Heydanus prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat. ad lib cui titulus eſt, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa Dei.</note> Council was confidently reported to be true in the Weſt, <hi>Parthenius</hi> himſelf was ſo ſurpriſed and offended thereat, that aſſembling his Clergy and People in the Patriarchal Church, he openly profeſſed 'twas falſe, and that he never intended ſuch an injury to the memory of <hi>Cyrillus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IN fine, Mr. <hi>Rivet,</hi> Doctor of Divinity, in <hi>Holland,</hi> writing to Mr. <hi>Sarrau,</hi> a Councellour in the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> the 21 of <hi>March,</hi> 1644. tells him touching this Buſineſs, <hi>That he ſaw (at Mr.</hi> Hagha'<hi>s a Letter written in Vulgar Greek, from</hi> Pachomius, the Metropolitain <hi>of</hi> Chalcedon, <hi>which diſowned the pretended Council under the Patriarch</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenius. <hi>Farther affirming, that the Subſcriptions were counterfeit, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly his. That this Piece was contrived by a Raſcal, &amp;c. That the Patriarch was a double minded man, yet denied what was printed in</hi> Moldavia <hi>to be the Act he ſigned; and that the Prince of</hi> Moldavia <hi>baniſhed the Author of this Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from his Territories.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT, ſuppoſing what I now alledged, to be wholly untrue, and that theſe two pretended Councils, were as really true as I believe 'em to be falſe, yet is it certain, they will but confirm the Proof we draw from <hi>Cyrillus</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion againſt Tranſubſtantiation, and change it into Demonſtration. Which will clearly appear, if we conſider, that whoſoever compoſed them, did all they could to turn <hi>Cyrillus</hi> his words into a ſence odious to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> even to the imputing to him ſeveral Falſities; that <hi>Cyrillus</hi> of <hi>Berrhaea</hi> who preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the firſt Council was a falſe <hi>Greek,</hi> and one of the Jeſuits Scholars, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged long ſince in the Party of the <hi>Latins,</hi> and that <hi>Parthenius</hi> ſeemed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe faſtned to the Roman Intereſt, if we take that for one of his Letters, which one <hi>Athanaſius</hi> a Latiniſing <hi>Greek</hi> publiſhed, in which he makes him thus write to the late King, <hi>That he heartily deſired the Peace of the two Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">

                           <hi>as much as any of his Predeceſſors, but if the Turk, under whoſe Empire they lived, knew of this Affair, he would kill 'em all. Yet could the King find out a way whereby to ſecure them from this danger, he ſolemnly protests that for his part he would not be wanting.</hi> So that we ſee here what kind of men the Authors of theſe two Cenſures have been, ſuppoſing 'em true, and yet they have not expreſly cenſured what <hi>Cyrillus Lucaris</hi> aſſerted touching Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation; the firſt of theſe, to wit, <hi>Cyrillus</hi> of <hi>Berrhaea</hi> ſay's, <hi>Anathematiſed be</hi> Cyrillus <hi>who teaches and believes that neither the Bread of the Altar, nor the Wine are changed,</hi>

                           </gap>, <hi>by the Prieſts Conſecration, and coming down of the Holy Spirit, into the real Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, ſeeing 'tis written in the ſeventeenth Article of his Heretical Doctrine, that what we ſee and take is not the Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The ſecond, namely, <hi>Parthenius,</hi> ſay's, <hi>His Doctrine is ſo deſtructive to the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>that, he attributes only the bare Figure to it, as if we were ſtill under the Old Law of Types and Shadows. For he denies the Bread which is ſeen and eaten, becomes after Conſecration the real Body of Jeſus Chriſt, in any other than a ſpiritual manner, or rather by imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is the higheſt pitch of Impiety. For Jeſus Chriſt did not ſay, This is the Figure of my Body, but this is my Body, this is my Blood, this, to wit, that which was ſeen, received, eaten, and broken after it was bleſſed and ſanctified.</hi>
                           <pb n="213" facs="tcp:41961:122"/> Not to take here notice, how captiouſly theſe People turn the Words of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillus,</hi> to make them contradictory to the Belief, and common Expreſſions of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> it will be ſufficient to obſerve, that howſoever prejudiced theſe Perſons have been, they durſt not re-eſtabliſh the Tranſubſtantiation he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly condemned, nor take any notice of that part of the Article which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects it in expreſs Terms. But to the end we may better judge of this, it will not be amiſs, to recite <hi>Cyrillus</hi> his own Words. <hi>We believe,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>that the ſecond Sacrament, which the Lord has inſtituted, is, that, which we call the</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, <hi>for in the Night in which he was betrayed, taking Bread and bleſſing it, he ſaid to his Apoſtles, take eat this is my Body; and taking the Cup, he gave thanks and ſaid, drink ye all of this, this is my Blood which is ſhed for you; do this in remembrance of me. And Saint</hi> Paul <hi>adds, as often as ye ſhall eat of this Bread, and drink of this Cup, ye ſhew the Lord's death. This is the plain, true, and lawful Tradition, of this admirable Myſtery, in the adminiſtration and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of which, we confeſs and believe a real, and certain Preſence, of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to wit, that which Faith offers and gives us, and not that which Tranſubſtantiation has raſhly invented and teaches. For we believe the faithful eat the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in the Sacrament, not in a ſenſible chewing of him with the teeth, in the Communion, but in communicating by the ſence of the Soul. For our Lord's Body is not in the Myſtery, what our eyes behold, and what we take, but that which Faith (which receives after a ſpiritual manner) preſents and gives us. Wherefore, it is certain if we believe, we eat, and participate; but if we believe not, we are deprived of this benefit.</hi> If you compare this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle with <hi>Cyrillus</hi> of <hi>Berrhaea</hi> and <hi>Parthenius</hi>'s Cenſures, you will find they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to that which is ſaid concerning <hi>Our Saviour's Body being not what we ſee and eat, but that which our Faith does ſpiritually receive,</hi> and that they endeavour to give theſe Words a conſtruction abominated by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and different from their uſual expreſſions. But as to what he ſays, touching Tranſubſtantiation, (which he calls <hi>a raſh invention,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>) we ſee they meddle not with that. They ſay that the Bread (<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>) <hi>is changed</hi> into the real Body of Jeſus Chriſt, that 'tis not a Figure, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Body, but that it is ſo, by a real Converſion of Subſtance, they do not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I diſpute not here concerning thoſe Perſons ſence that drew up theſe Cenſures; for I do not queſtion but they were <hi>Latins</hi> in their hearts, and I further believe had they dared they would have proceeded farther; but any man may perceive they deſigned to accommodate themſelves to the Style of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the better to colour over their Forgeries. You ſee on one hand <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> who oppoſes Tranſubſtantiation in plain Terms, boldly naming it, and giving it a Title ſufficient to ſtartle a Church that believed it, and on the other, we behold Perſons intereſſed to run down <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> and that leave no means unattempted whereby to render him odious to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that poyſon all he ſays, and yet dare not defend this Tranſubſtantiation, neither directly nor indirectly, neither in expreſs Terms, nor equivalent ones. What means this Myſtery, if the Greek Church does in effect believe the converſion of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances? Could they light of a better occaſion wherein to ſhow their Zeal for Orthodoxy, and to confound at the ſame time <hi>Cyrillus</hi> his Accomplices.</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> tells us, <hi>That the Word</hi>

Yet do they take no notice thereof, they forſake the Term and the thing repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by it, and contain themſelves in their general expreſſions. Is not this then an evident token <hi>Cyrillus</hi> ſaid nothing in this reſpect which oppoſed the Doctrine of his Church?</p>
                        <p>AND this is what we had to ſay touching this Patriarch. I am very much miſtaken if any comparing this Chapter with the Third, which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has made on this Subject, will accuſe me of raſhneſs, for ſaying the real Doctrine of the <hi>Greeks</hi> appears in <hi>Cyrillus</hi> his Confeſſion. For 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that man who barely conſiders what I now mentioned touching <hi>Cyrillus</hi> his Confeſſion, cannot but conclude the Greek Church believed not Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation. It only remains, for the finiſhing of this Chapter, that I ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing touching the State of this Church ſince the year 1642. the fixt time of the laſt of theſe pretented Cenſures. <hi>Parthenius</hi> having cauſed <hi>Cyrillus</hi> of <hi>Berrhaea</hi> to be baniſhed, and afterwards ſtrangled after the ſame manner as he ſerved his Predeceſſor, he himſelf remained not long on the Throne. His bad Conduct, brought him down thence, and the Church of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſubſtituted one, (who had been <hi>Cyrillus Lucaris</hi> his Diſciple,) and named like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Parthenius</hi> in his place. Which <hi>Allatius</hi> acknowledges in a Letter he <note place="margin">

                        <p>THIS condition wherein we now beheld the Greek Church laſted from the year 1645. till 1653. Obſerve here what Doctour <hi>Baſire</hi> a Reverend Divine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whom I have already mentioned wrote to me about it. <hi>When I was at</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>which was in the year</hi> 1653. Payſius <hi>was then Patriarch of it, who in token of Communion with the Church of</hi> England, <hi>laid his hands on me in an Aſſembly of Biſhops, according to cuſtom, as being a Prieſt of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and with this impoſition of hands gave me power to preach in Greek in all the Greek Churches within his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction. Which I afterwards did very often, according as occaſion offered, as well at</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>as elſewhere, altho the Jeſuits ſeemed to be very much diſpleaſed thereat. I preached one Sunday to the Engliſh, another in French for</hi>

                        <p>BUT what do the <hi>Greeks</hi> then believe, if they believe not Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation? The Bounds of this Controverſie oblige me not to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this Queſtion. For it concerning us here only to inquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Greeks</hi> do, or do not believe the Converſion of Subſtances, it is ſufficient that we ſhow they do not believe it, ſeeing as I have already ſaid, we pretend not, that their Faith muſt be the rule of ours; yet will I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſatisfie the Reader in this particular. I do alſo hope, that this inquiry will not be uſeleſs towards the clearing up of the principal Queſtion, between Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> and my ſelf, becauſe that in ſhewing what the <hi>Greeks</hi> do believe, I do at the ſame time ſhew what they do not believe. I ſhall do then three things in this Chapter, the firſt of which ſhall be to ſhew the real Belief of the <hi>Greeks</hi> touching the Euchariſt; Secondly, deſcribe in what they agree, and differ from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And thirdly, likewiſe, wherein we of the Reformed Church do agree with them, and in what parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars we do not.</p>
                        <p>AS to the firſt of theſe Points, to the end we may have a fuller and clearer underſtanding of the real Opinion of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> it will be neceſſary we make ſeveral Articles of it, and reduce them into theſe following Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
                        <p>FIRST, in general, the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is, according to them, a myſtical repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the whole Oeconomy of Jeſus Chriſt. They expreſs by it his coming into the World, his being born of a Virgin, his Sufferings, Death, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion into Heaven, and the Glory he diſplayed on the Earth in making himſelf known and adored by every Creature. Were it neceſſary to prove this Propoſition, we could eaſily do it, by the Greek Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, and Teſtimonies of <hi>Cabaſilas, Germain, Simeon Theſſalonienſis, Jeremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> and ſeveral others; but this not being a matter of conteſt, I ſhall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon it.</p>
                        <p>SECONDLY, They conſider the Bread in two diſtinct reſpects, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whilſt it is as yet on the Table of the <hi>Protheſis,</hi> or on the great Altar. Whilſt 'tis on the <hi>Protheſis,</hi> they hold 'tis a Type or Figure. Yet do they
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:41961:124"/> ſometimes call it the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, ſometimes, the imperfect Body of Chriſt, ſometimes the dead Body of Jeſus Chriſt, although they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Conſecration is then compleated. This is confirmed by what I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the Fourth Chapter of this Third Book, and it is not likewiſe neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to inſiſt any longer thereon, becauſe this particular concerns not the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hand.</p>
                        <p>THIRDLY, When the Symbols are carried and placed on the great Altar, they ſay that by the Prayers of the Prieſt, and Deſcent of the Holy Spirit, the Bread and Wine, are perfectly conſecrated and changed into the Body and Blood of Chriſt. To expreſs this change, they uſe theſe general Terms I already noted, to wit, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ſignifie a change. They ſay the Bread is the Body of Chriſt, and that it is made the very Body it ſelf, or the proper Body of Chriſt, and hereunto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all thoſe Citations Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has alledged out of <hi>Theophylact, Euthymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Nicholas Methonienſis, Cabaſilas, Simeon Theſſalonienſis</hi> and <hi>Jeremias.</hi> We do not deny that the <hi>Greeks</hi> uſe theſe Expreſſions, it concerns us here only to know in what ſence the Greek Church uſes them, and what kind of change they mean thereby.</p>
                        <p>I ſay then, that when we come to examine this change, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in what manner the Bread and Wine, are made the Body and Blood of Chriſt, they curb our curioſity, and remit this knowledge and determination to God, and for their own parts keep within their general Terms. Which appears by the profeſſion of Faith which the <hi>Sarrazins</hi> made in the Twelfth Century, when they imbraced the Greek Religion; <hi>I believe,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Bibl. Patr. Tom. 2. Graeco-Lat.</note> ſay's the Proſelyte, <hi>and confeſs the Bread and Wine which are myſtically ſacrificed by the Chriſtians, and of which they partake in their Divine Sacraments. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve likewiſe that this Bread and Wine, are in truth the Body and Blood of Chriſt, being changed intellectually and inviſibly by his Divine Power above all natural conception, he alone knowing the manner of it.</hi> And upon this account it was, that <hi>Nicetas Choniatus</hi> complains, that in the Twelfth Century the Doctrine <note place="margin">Nicetas Choni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at. Annal. lib. 3.</note> of the Divine Myſteries was divulged, and therefore cenſures the Patriarch <hi>Camaterus</hi> for his not having immediately ſilenced a Monk, who propoſed this Queſtion (to wit) whether we receive in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> the corruptible or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible Body of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>He ſhould have been condemned,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>for an Heretick that introduced Novelties, all the reſt ſilenced by his example, to the end the Myſtery may ever remain a Myſtery.

Cathem.</note> of the <hi>Greeks</hi> recites a Prayer, wherein it is ſaid, <hi>That the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt are touched, and changed on the Altar, after a ſupernatural manner, which muſt not be inquired into.</hi> We have likewiſe already ſeen in the Tenth Chapter of this Book the Teſtimony of <hi>Metrophanus,</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> who having told us the conſecrated Bread is really the Body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus <note place="margin">Confeſſ.

                        <p>ANOTHER Greek Author, cited by <hi>Allatius,</hi> under the name of <hi>John</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Allat. adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chreygton exercit. 22.</note> the Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem. You ſee,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>that Saint</hi> Paul <hi>ſcruples not to call this Body Bread. But be it ſo if you will, that it be no longer called Bread, and being no longer Bread is neither leavened nor unleavened, you ſee that it is not bereaved of theſe Appellations till after Sanctification. But before this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
                           <pb n="217" facs="tcp:41961:124"/> 
                           <hi>Sacrifice, when you offer it to ſanctifie it, ſhall this be neither Bread nor an Azyme? Now that which is done in this Oblation is by our ſelves; but that which happens in this admirable change, is not from us but God.</hi> It appears by this paſſage recited by <hi>Allatius,</hi> and taken if I be not deceived out of a Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, wherein this Author diſputes touching the Azymes againſt a <hi>Latin</hi> who told him, that this Controverſie was vain, ſeeing that after the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, it is no longer Bread, but the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and it ſeems this Patriarch maintains againſt him, that 'twas ſtill Bread, and proves it by the Authority of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſo calls it. It ſeems likewiſe by what he adds, that he would ſay, that ſuppoſing it was no longer called Bread, and loſt this name, yet we muſt not ſpeak of what it becomes by Conſecration, becauſe God only knows that, and not men.</p>
                        <p>ALTHO the <hi>Greeks</hi> are ſometimes thus reſerved, reſtraining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves within their general Terms, yet for the moſt part they ſhew more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly their thoughts, touching the nature, and kind of the change which happens to the Bread and Wine, and which makes them to be the Body and Blood of Chriſt: And they do it likewiſe in ſuch a manner, that 'tis no hard matter to find out their meaning: Which is what we have now to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate. But before we enter into this Deduction, it will not be amiſs to obſerve, that the Bread and wine may be conceived to be changed into the Body and Blood of Chriſt two ways. Firſt, by a real converſion of the whole Subſtance of Bread and Wine, into the Subſtance of the Body and Blood, I mean into the ſame numerical Subſtance (as the Schools ſpeak) ſo that the Subſtance of Bread ſubſiſts no longer after the change, which is what is held in the Roman Church. Secondly, by the addition of a new quality, or form in the Bread and Wine, ſo that their firſt Subſtance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, they receive that which they had not before, and by this reception become that which they were not. In this firſt manner of conceiving the change, the Subſtance of Bread, and that of the Body are conſidered as two Terms, or two different Subjects, the firſt of which does not ſubſiſt, but paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes over into the other. In the ſecond, the Bread is conſidered as a Subject that always ſubſiſts, but which receiving into it that which it had not, by this means becomes the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the paper which receives the Characters and Seal of a Prince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Princes Letter, or Wax receiving the Impreſſion of a Seal, is made the Seal it ſelf, or Wool dyed in Scarlet, becomes a ſcarlet colour, or Wood receiving the impreſſion of fire, becomes fire it ſelf, or in fine, as the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we take, receiving the form of our Fleſh, and being joyned thereunto, becomes our Body. By which it appears that to proceed faithfully, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly, in our Inquiries after the real Belief of the <hi>Greeks</hi> it muſt firſt be acknowledged, that theſe expreſſions; <hi>The Bread is changed into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, the Bread is made the Body of Chriſt, the Bread is the Body it ſelf, or the proper Body of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> are in themſelves general expreſſions, and that they may be ſimply taken in this their generality, or applied to ſeveral particular, ſences. Now if Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would have us take theſe expreſſions in the ſence of Tranſubſtantiation, he muſt produce ſome ſolid and real paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges out of Greek Authors, by which it may appear that 'tis in this ſence they underſtood them, and that they cannot admit of any other. Which is no more than what he ought to have done, but he has been far from under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking it, knowing it to be a thing abſolutely impoſſible.</p>
                        <p>AS to my own part, had I only intended to ſhew the inſufficiency of Mr.
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:41961:125"/> 
                           <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Proofs, I might content my ſelf with alledging this generality, for it alone is ſufficient to hinder him from drawing any Concluſion. But ſeeing I have taken upon me, to ſhew in this Chapter, what the real Sentiment of the Greek Church is, I find my ſelf obliged to bring, not Arguments, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions from my own Head, but good and ſolid paſſages of the <hi>Greeks</hi> themſelves; which plainly demonſtrate what kind of change they mean.</p>
                        <p>FOR this effect I ſhall reduce what they ſay concerning it, to this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; They believe that by the Conſecration there is made a kind of compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition or mixture of Bread and Wine, and Holy Spirit; that theſe Symbols keeping their own proper nature, are joyned to the Divinity, and by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion they receive from the Holy Ghoſt, are changed (for the Faithful on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) into the virtue of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, being made by this means not a Figure, but the proper, and real Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and this by way of Augmentation of the ſame natural Body of Jeſus Chriſt. To which they apply the Compariſons I already mentioned, concerning the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which becomes our proper Body by Aſſimilation and Augmentation, of the Wood which is put to the Fire, of the Wool which receives the dye, of Paper that is made the Princes Letter, and Wax, or other Matter which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Impreſſion of the Seal.</p>
                        <p>This Propoſition having ſeveral parts, and each of them of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in this Queſtion, it is therefore neceſſary to eſtabliſh them one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other diſtinctly and ſolidly.</p>
                        <p>FIRST, They believe there is a compoſition or mixture made of the Bread with the Holy Spirit. <hi>Metrophanus</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſhews us, that this is their Doctrine. For obſerve here what he ſay's in his Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith of the Eaſtern Church in his Chapter of the Sacraments, <hi>God,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>has communicated his Grace to the Elect, not only after a ſpiritual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Confeſ. Eccleſ. Or. cap. 5.</note> 
                           <hi>but likewiſe by ſome ſenſible ſigns, as moſt certain pledges of his promiſe. For as we are compoſed of two parts, ſo likewiſe the manner of communicating his Grace muſt be double, to wit, by a ſenſible matter, and by the Holy Spirit, ſeeing the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that receive theſe things are made up of a ſenſible Body and intelligent Soul; Now theſe Pledges are that which we call the Myſteries, to wit, Baptiſm and the Holy Communion, which conſiſt of viſible Matter, and of the Holy Spirit.</hi> Theſe Words are ſo plain, that they need no Comment. He affirms there are two things in the Sacraments, and particularly in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> to wit, the ſenſible Matter, and the Holy Spirit. Now the ſenſible Matter in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> can be nothing elſe but the Bread and the Wine.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>METROPHANUS,</hi> affirms moreover the ſame thing in his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>touching the Lord's Supper,</hi> wherein he ſay's, <hi>that the Myſtery never loſes</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid cap. 9.</note> 
                           <hi>the Sanctification it has once received, and that it is indelible.</hi> It is here where he compares the Sanctification the Bread receives, to Wool when 'tis dyed in any colour, which includes apparently this <hi>Idea</hi> of the Compoſition of Bread, and the Holy Spirit almoſt after the ſame manner as Wool that is dyed is a compoſition or mixture of Wool and dye.</p>
                        <p>THIS Greek Patriarch has only followed in this, the Doctrine of <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mias</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in his Anſwer to the Divines of <hi>Wittem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, Conſiſting,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>as we do of two Parts, that is to ſay, of a Body and a</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Jerem. Rep. 1. ad Theologos Wittemb.</note> 
                           <hi>Soul, our Saviour Chriſt has therefore given us theſe things doubly,</hi> (he means the Sacraments) <hi>he himſelf conſiſting of two Natures, being both God and Man.</hi>
                           <pb n="219" facs="tcp:41961:125"/> 
                           <hi>He ſpiritually ſanctifies our Souls by the Grace of his Spirit, and ſanctifies like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe our Bodies by ſenſible Matters, namely, with Oyl, Water, Bread and Wine, and other things ſanctified by the Holy Spirit, and thus gives us a compleat Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> He not only ſay's, that the Sacraments in general are things that are double (as he terms them) conſiſting of things ſenſible, and the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but ſay's, this particularly of the Bread and Wine in the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>WITH this agrees the expreſſions of the Greek Liturgies, and thoſe of the moſt famous Authors of this Church, who call the Sacrament <hi>the Holy Bread, the Conſecrated Bread, the Divine Bread, the Gifts ſanctified by the Holy Spirit,</hi> for theſe Expreſſions do naturally denote that compoſition or duplicity aforementioned.</p>
                        <p>NOW if we would know how it has come to paſs, the <hi>Greeks</hi> of latter Ages have thus expreſſed themſelves in relation to this part of their Belief, we need only look back to the foregoing Ages, for we ſhall there find Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Expreſſions on the ſame Subject, if not wholly conformable to the Expreſſions of the Modern <hi>Greeks,</hi> yet which come very near them, and which have ſerved for a Foundation to 'em, as will appear by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Paſſages.</p>
                        <p>WE may then here mark what the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the Council of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> in the Eighth Century aſſerted. <hi>As the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is Holy,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">In actis Concil. Nic. 2 act. 6.</note> 
                           <hi>becauſe 'tis deified, ſo likewiſe, that which is his Body by Inſtitution, to wit, his Holy Image is made Divine, by a Sanctification of Grace. For as by virtue of the Hypoſtatical Union, our Saviour deified the Fleſh he took on him, by a Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication naturally proper to him, ſo in like manner he will have the Bread in the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>(which is the real Image of his Fleſh) to become a Divine Body by the Deſcent of the Holy Spirit into it, the Oblation being, by means of the Prieſt, transferred from a common State, to a State of Holineſs. And therefore the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt endued with Soul and Underſtanding, has been anointed by the Holy Spirit, being united to the Divinity, and ſo likewiſe his Image, to wit, the Divine Bread, is filled with the Holy Spirit.</hi> Who ſees not in theſe words the Union, and Compoſition of Bread with the Holy Spirit? <hi>The Bread,</hi> ſay they, <hi>is made Divine by a Sanctification of Grace, it becomes a Divine Body by the Deſcent of the Holy Spirit into it; the Bread is filled with the Holy Spirit, in like manner as the natural Fleſh of our Lord has been ſanctified, deified, and anointed with the Holy Spirit, by virtue of the Hypoſtatical Union.</hi> All this plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly favours the <hi>Compoſition</hi> of the Modern <hi>Greeks.</hi> Now this Teſtimony is the more conſiderable, in that the ſecond <hi>Nicene</hi> Council having been held on purpoſe to overthrow whatſoever had been determined in that of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> touching the Point of Images, they cenſured the name of <hi>Image,</hi> which their Adverſaries had given the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> but left untouched the other Clauſes, I now mentioned. Which ſhews that theſe kind of Expreſſions, were received by both Parties, and that this was the common Doctrine of the whole Greek Church.</p>
                        <p>IN effect if we aſcend higher, we ſhall find, that Saint <hi>Ephraim</hi> Biſhop <note place="margin">Apud. Phol. Bib. Cod. 229.</note> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who lived about the Sixth Century, thus expreſſed himſelf, <hi>That the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, which the faithful receive, does not leave its ſenſible Subſtance, nor is ſeperated from the ſpiritual Grace.</hi> Which does moreover fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Duplicity, or Compoſition of Bread with the Holy Spirit.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>THOMAS a Jeſu</hi> tells us of an Errour wherewith almoſt all the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern <note place="margin">Thom. à Jeſu. lib. de procur. ſalute omn. gent. part. 2. lib. 7. cap 7.</note> Chriſtians are infected: which is; <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt ſoaked the Bread he was to give to</hi> Judas, <hi>that he might thereby take away its Conſecration.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs 'tis a great abſurdity to imagine the Conſecration can be taken away by this means; but 'tis eaſie to perceive, theſe ignorant People have fallen into this Errour, by conceiving the Conſecration under the <hi>Idea</hi> of a real impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made on the Subſtance of Bread, for thereupon they have imagined this impreſſion might be effaced in waſhing the Bread, or ſoaking it.</p>
                        <p>AND thus far concerning the firſt part of my Propoſition. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, is, <hi>That they believe the Bread and Wine keeping their proper nature are joyned to the Divinity.</hi> Which is the ſame thing as the firſt, only, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe expreſſed. They will then mutually aſſiſt and ſtrengthen each other. For this effect I ſhall produce the Teſtimony of <hi>Nicholas Methonienſis,</hi> who lived in the Twelfth Century. This Author in anſwering thoſe that doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> was the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe they ſaw neither Fleſh nor Blood, but Bread and Wine, reſolves the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this manner. <hi>God,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>who knows all things, and is perfectly good, has wiſely ordered this in reſpect of our weakneſs, leſt we ſhould have in horror the Pledges of Eternal Life, being not able to behold Fleſh and Blood, he has there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appointed this to be done by things, to which our nature is accuſtomed, and has joyned to them his Divinity, ſaying, this is my Body, this is my Blood.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> pretends to make advantage of theſe Doubts, which <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Nicolaus Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon. adverſ. dubitantes, &amp;c. Bibl. Patr. Craeco-Lat. Tom. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>Methonienſis</hi> treats of, but we ſhall anſwer this Point in its due place. It ſuffices at preſent that we behold this Author laying down on one hand, <hi>the things to which our natures are accuſtomed,</hi> that is to ſay, Bread and Wine, and on the other, he aſſures us, <hi>that the Divinity is joyned to them.</hi> Which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly what I was to prove, whence it follows, that according to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the Bread and Wine remain in Union with the Divinity. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> who ſaw the force of this Paſſage, has endeavoured to avoid it by a frivolous evaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>God joyns,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>his Divinity to the Bread and Wine. 'Tis true, but</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib 2 cap. 13. pag. 231.</note> 
                           <hi>he has joyned it as the efficacious cauſe of the change of the Bread and Wine into the Body and Blood of Chriſt, ſo often repeated, by</hi> Nicholas Methonienſis, <hi>but</hi>
                           <pb n="221" facs="tcp:41961:126"/> 
                           <hi>not as a means of Union between the Bread and Wine, and Body of Jeſus Chriſt. He has joyned it to the Bread, not to conſerve it in the Subſtance of Bread, but to transform it internally into his Body.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I ſay this is a frivolous evaſion. For according to this reckoning we muſt underſtand by the things familiar to our natures, the Bread and Wine, as the matter to which the Divinity is joyned to change it. But were this the ſence of <hi>Nicholas Methonienſis,</hi> what would this contribute to the clearing up the doubt propoſed to him? The Queſtion is, <hi>whether the Fleſh and Blood would not appear, if they were in the Sacrament,</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Methonienſis</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, that the Bread and Wine are the matter changed by the Divinity, which effects this change. This is certainly a very ſtrange way of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to ſay, he joyns his Divinity to them, to ſignifie that he tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates them. We ſee few People thus expreſs themſelves. But ſuppoſing this, what relation has this to the Doubt he pretends to reſolve? If the Fleſh of Chriſt were in the Sacrament, ſay theſe Dubitants, it would appear, we ſhould ſee it. I anſwer, ſay, <hi>Nicholas Methonienſis,</hi> (according to Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi>'s Comment) that the Bread and Wine are the matter which is changed, and that the Almighty power of God changes them. Can any Anſwer be more ridiculous? This Author muſt certainly loſt his Wits to make ſuch a Reply. They do not ask him, what the matter is that is changed, nor what the efficient cauſe of this change, but, why, if it be uſe Body of Chriſt, it does not appear to be Fleſh, but Bread; Matter, Cauſe, efficacy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute nothing to the ſolving of this Doubt. This Gloſs then of Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi>'s is abſurd, and if we ſuppoſe <hi>Nicholas Methonienſis</hi> ſpake ſence, it muſt be granted, that his meaning is, that the Bread and Wine, remaining Bread and Wine, are yet notwithſtanding made the Body and Blood of Chriſt, by reaſon of their Union to the Divinity, and not otherwiſe. Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that it muſt not be expected they ſhould appear to be Fleſh and Blood, becauſe they are not ſo in reſpect of their Matter, or Subſtance, but only by their Union to the Divinity, which makes them in ſome ſort to be the ſame thing, with the Body and Blood.</p>
                        <p>THIS Opinion ſeems to be derived from <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> whoſe expreſſions I deſire I may have leave to mention, altho we muſt uſe them alſo in another place. For 'tis certain, that to judge aright of the Opinion of the Modern <hi>Greeks,</hi> we muſt aſcend ſo far. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has himſelf obſerved, that, <hi>John Damaſcen is another Saint</hi> Thomas <hi>amongſt the</hi> Greeks, and has been ever the rule of their Doctrine touching the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> Elſewhere he aſſures us, <hi>That we need only read the Treatiſes of the Modern</hi> Greeks, <hi>to find that they</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 6. pag. 155. Lib. 2. cap. 12.</note> 
                           <hi>wholly conform themſelves to the Sentiment and Expreſſions of this Father.</hi> This then is a Principle with Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> ſo that to convince him touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Belief of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> there is a kind of neceſſity lying upon us to conſult this Father.</p>
                        <p>OBSERVE here then what he ſay's in his Fourth Book of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Faith, <hi>The Bread and Wine are not the Figure of the Body and Blood of</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Damaſcen de Orthod. fid. lib. 4 cap. 14.</note> 
                           <hi>Chriſt; God forbid; but they are the deified Body it ſelf of Jeſus Chriſt, the Lord himſelf ſaying unto us, this is, not the Figure of my Body, but my Body, not the Figure of my Blood, but my Blood: He had ſaid before to the Jews, if ye eat not the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, you will have no life in you, for my Fleſh is Meat indeed, and my Blood is Drink indeed.</hi> And then again, <hi>He that eateth me ſhall live. Draw we near then with trembling,</hi>
                           <pb n="222" facs="tcp:41961:127"/> 
                           <hi>with a pure Conſcience, a firm Faith, and it will be unto us according to the constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and firmneſs of our Faith. Honour we it with a perfect purity of Body and Soul. For it is double. Approach we towards it with a fervent deſire, and placing our hands in manner of a Croſs, receive we the Body of him that was crucified for us. Let us put it on our Eyes, Lips, and Forehead; and take we thus the Divine Coal, to the end our Devotion being inflamed thereby, our ſins may be conſumed, and our hearts inlightned, and that by the participation of this Divine Fire, we may our ſelves become inflamed and deified.</hi> Eſaias <hi>ſaw a Coal. Now a Coal is not meer Wood, but Wood in conjunction with Fire. So the Bread of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is not mere Bread, being it is united to the Divinity. Now a Body united to the Divinity is not one ſingle nature, but two, one being that of the Body, and th'other that of the Divinity annexed thereunto. So that to take them together, it is not one only nature, but two.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THESE Words clearly ſhew, that <hi>Damaſcen</hi> means, that the Bread in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> which is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, is double, becauſe 'tis joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Divinity, that 'tis not mere Bread, but Bread united to the Divinity, conſiſting of two natures, one of Bread, and th'other of the Divinity which is joyned to it; in like manner as <hi>Eſaias</hi> his live Coal was not meer Wood, but Wood in conjunction with Fire. Now this is what is exactly contained in my Propoſition, that the Bread, and Wine keeping their proper nature are joyned to the Divinity, according to the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> who ſaw the force of this Paſſage, that he might get clear off it, has bethought himſelf, to ſay, that the Duplicity which <hi>Damaſcen</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions muſt be underſtood as meant of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, who conſiſts of two Natures. He rehearſes the Paſſage in hand to theſe Words, <hi>Duplex</hi>

                           <hi>eſt enim,</hi> and then adds, <hi>it is plain that hitherto theſe Words relate to Jeſus Chriſt, and his true and real Fleſh, and that 'tis of him it is ſaid, Duplex eſt enim, which is to ſay, that he is compoſed of two Natures,</hi> and a little farther, <hi>It plainly appears that Saint</hi> John Damaſcen'<hi>s Deſign is to exhort us to a double</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                           <hi>purity of Soul and Body, to honour the double Nature of Jeſus Chriſt, and to ſhow that we receive in the Communion this double Nature. So that theſe Words, non eſt panis ſimplex ſed unitus divinitati, corpus autem unitum divinitati non eſt una natura ſed duae, una quidem corporis alter a conjunctae Divinitatis, are the Expoſition of what he ſaid before, that Jeſus Chriſt was double.

                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> methinks ſhould take more care another time of what he writes, and not give us ſo many of his; <hi>It is clear, it manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, for there is nothing ſo clear as the contrary of what he ſay's. Damaſcen</hi> ſpeaking of the Bread of the Communion, ſay's, that 'tis not a Figure, but the deified Body of Jeſus Chriſt, he would have us honour this Body, that is to ſay, that Body which we receive in the Communion, with a double purity of Body and Soul, externally and internally, becauſe 'tis double. He ſhews what ought to be our inward diſpoſition, to wit, a fervent deſire, he paſſes to our external Actions, which are, to hold our arms croſs-wiſe, and to hold the Communion we receive on our Eyes, Lips, and Forehead. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to explain how this Body is double; he compares it to the Coal <hi>Eſaias</hi> ſaw, which was not bare wood, but wood and fire together. Then apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immediately his compariſon, he adds, <hi>Thus the Bread of the Communion is not mere Bread, being it is united to the Divinity. Now a Body united to the Divinity, is not one ſingle nature, but two, one of the Body, and th'other of the Divinity, which is joyned thereunto.</hi> Who ſees not then, that <hi>this double Body,</hi> of which he ſpeaks, and which he compared to <hi>Eſaias</hi> Coal, is the Bread of the Communion, that it is <hi>double,</hi> being Bread united to the Divinity, and that the effect of this Union is, not to change the nature of the Bread, but to make a compoſition of <hi>two Natures.</hi> Whence it manifeſtly follows, that one of theſe Natures being the Divinity, th'other is the nature of Bread. It is then true, as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has obſerved, that theſe laſt words, <hi>Sit panis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munionis non eſt panis ſimplex ſed unitus divinitati,</hi> are the expoſition of what he ſaid before, <hi>Duplex eſt enim, for it is double.</hi> But becauſe <hi>duplex</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers not to Jeſus Chriſt, but to the Body we receive in the Communion; it is therefore likewiſe true, that they expound what we muſt underſtand by this Body, to wit, the Bread united to the Divinity.</p>
                        <p>BUT I muſt puruſe the other parts of my Propoſition. The <hi>Greeks</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <hi>That by the impreſſion which the Bread and Wine receive from the Holy Spirit, they are changed into the virtue of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Christ, and made by this means this Body and Blood.</hi> Which is apparent, firſt, from all thoſe Paſſages of the Liturgies I mentioned in the Fifth Chapter of this Book; the reſult whereof, is, that the Bread becomes the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, in aſmuch as 'tis made capable of ſanctifying us, and that this is exactly what the Prieſt prayes for in the words of Conſecration. Now what is this, but the Bread's being made the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in virtue?</p>
                        <p>SECONDLY, This appears likewiſe by what we have ſeen from <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon Theſſalonienſis,</hi> who tells us, that the unconſecrated Particles being mixed with thoſe that are conſecrated, and partaking of their Sanctification, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in ſome ſort, the Body of Chriſt, and are proper for the Communion of the Faithful. For this neceſſarily ſuppoſes, as I ſhewed in the Fifth Chapter, of this Third Book, that the conſecrated Particle it ſelf is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, in aſmuch as it receives this Sanctification.</p>
                        <p>THIRDLY, This moreover appears by the Paſſages of <hi>Cabaſilas,</hi> which I alledged in the Sixth Chapter, by which we ſee that he takes for the ſame thing, to receive Sanctification, and to receive the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. Which likewiſe neceſſarily ſuppoſes that the Bread becomes the Body of Chriſt, only in Sanctification and virtue.</p>

                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> nibbles at this Paſſage, <hi>Euthymius,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>ſay's that Jeſus</hi>

                           <hi>Chriſt changes after an ineffable manner, the Bread into his own Body. This ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, ſay's Mr.</hi> Claude, <hi>that he changes it, not into his Body, but into the virtue of his Body.</hi> Euthymius <hi>ſay's, that he changes the Wine into his Blood. This ſignifies, ſay's Mr</hi> Claude, <hi>that he changes it, not into his Blood, but into the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Blood.</hi> Euthymius <hi>adds, that he changes them into the virtue of both one and the other, in gratiam ipſorum. This Addition has perplexed Mr.</hi> Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, <hi>and therefore he has thought good not to mention it. But in adding it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis there in effect, the whole expreſſion of</hi> Euthymius <hi>expounded in the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts ſence will be, that Jeſus Chriſt changes the Bread into the virtue of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the Wine into the virtue of his Blood, and into the virtue of both one and the other. Who ever heard of ſuch a folly to joyn together the Metaphorical Term, and the expoſition of the Metaphorical Term, as two diſtinct and ſeparate things? Do we ſay, for example, that the Stone is Jeſus Chriſt, and the Sign of Jeſus Chriſt; that the Ark was the Church, and the Figure of the Church; that the Paſchal Lamb was Christ, and the repreſentation of Chriſt; that Anger changes men into Beaſts, and into the fury of Beaſts.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>ALL this is but vain Rhetorick. <hi>Euthymius</hi> ſay's, <hi>We muſt not conſider the nature of the things offered us, but their virtue.</hi> This is not the Language of a man, that would ſay, that the nature of Bread and Wine ceaſes to be, and that we muſt conſider the proper Subſtance of Jeſus Chriſt under the Vail of Accidents. This Expreſſion on the contrary ſuppoſes that the nature of theſe things ſubſiſts, altho we muſt not conſider it, but raiſe up our minds to the Conſideration of the ſupernatural virtue they receive. When then he adds, <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt changes the Bread, and Wine into his own Body and Blood,</hi> it is true that this ſignifies, according to my Interpretation, that he changes them into the virtue of his Body and Blood, and not into their Subſtance. But what he ſay's afterwards, <hi>and into the virtue of both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

All theſe ETS, are explicatives, and are put for that is to ſay's.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> need not contend about a thing ſo well known as this is; I ſay then <hi>Euthymius</hi> having firſt ſaid, <hi>That we muſt not conſider the nature of things which are placed on the Altar, but their virtue,</hi> and afterwards adding, <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt changes the Bread and Wine into his own Body and Blood, AND into the virtue of both one and the other,</hi> the firſt Propoſition which reſpects only the <hi>vertue,</hi> in ſuppoſing that the nature of Bread and Wine ſubſiſts, leads us to the underſtanding of the ſecond, and makes us eaſily comprehend, that 'tis as much as if he had ſaid, that he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them into his Body and Blood, which is to ſay, into the virtue both of the one and th'other. For 'tis of the virtue not the ſubſtance, which his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe treats of. Had <hi>Euthymius</hi> meant by his change into the Body and Blood, a change of Subſtance, what could move him to add, that they are likewiſe changed into the virtue of both one and the other? Beſides that to ſpeak properly, it would not be true, that the change was made into the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ſeeing it would terminate it ſelf only in the Subſtance, and that the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue would be only as a ſequel of the Subſtance, and not as a Term of the change; beſides this, I ſay, wherefore ſhould he ſpeak of this change of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? To inform us that the Subſtance is not alone; but who doubts that the ſanctifying virtue of the Body and Blood is every where, where their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is, and what need is there of informing the Readers of this?</p>
                        <p>FIFTHLY, When <hi>Euthymius</hi> his expreſſion were ambiguous, yet would they be cleared up by thoſe of other Greek Authors, that better explain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſhew that the common Doctrine of this Church is, that the Bread and Wine are the Body and Blood of Chriſt, inaſmuch as they are changed into their virtue.</p>

                        <p>WE muſt obſerve, he makes this anſwer, to People, that doubted, whether the Bread was the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe they ſaw no ſuch thing as the latter of theſe. When then he tells them, that the Bread and Wine are changed into the virtue of the Fleſh and Blood; it is clear he means, that the Bread and Wine are changed only in virtue, whence it follows, 'tis not to be expected they ſhould appear to be Fleſh and Blood, for otherwiſe he would not ſatisfie the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty he had propoſed. Were they changed into the real Subſtance of Fleſh and Blood, as well as into their virtue, the doubt would ſtill remain, to wit, that they muſt ſtill appear Fleſh and Blood. The change of Virtue would not decide the Queſtion. We ſhall examine in their due order, all the frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous exceptions, which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> oppoſes againſt the evidence of this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and likewiſe hope to give a ſatisfactory account to whatſoever he alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from this Author. I muſt not now interrupt my Proof by a Digreſſion which would carry me too far. It is ſufficient to ſhew, that <hi>Theophylact</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly affirms, that if the Bread and Wine appear not to be Fleſh and Blood, 'tis becauſe God changes them <hi>into the virtue of this Fleſh and Blood.</hi>

                           <hi>They that come,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>to the Baptiſm, receive the virtue which Jeſus Chriſt brought to it when he deſcended into it, and are illuminated by the communication of his light. Thus, is the Oracle of the Prophet, accompliſhed, which ſay's, that there ſhall happen in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>a change in the virtue of Bread and Water, and there ſhall be given to them a ſaving virtue. For here, to wit, in Jeſus Chriſt, the virtue of Bread and force of Water are made ſtrong, not that the Bread is thus powerful to us, but the virtue of the Bread: For as to the Bread, it is indeed an Aliment, but there is in him a VIRTUE to inliven us.</hi>

Do you ſee this Holy Altar where we attend? As to its nature, 'tis a common ſtone, which differs in nothing from others with which we build our Houſes. But when it has been ſanctified by the Divine Service performed thereon, and received the bleſſing, it becomes a Holy Table, an impolluted Altar, which all the World can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not touch, the Sacred Miniſters alone touch it, but yet with reſpect. So the Bread is at firſt common Bread, but after the Myſtical Conſecration, it is called, and is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. I affirm the ſame concerning the Myſtical Oyl</hi>

For this purpoſe he alledges divers Examples of mean and deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things in themſelves, which by their Conſecration, acquire an excellent virtue and efficacy. Amongſt which, he eſpecially reckons the Bread, and Wine, in the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> As to the Wine, he makes uſe of the Term of, <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi> but as to the Bread, he ſay's, 'tis the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; which plainly ſhews, that in his ſence, to be the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and to have an excellent operation, is but one and the ſame thing.</p>

So that methinks Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has no reaſon to turn into ſport, and raillery, as he has done, this change of virtue, in calling it our <hi>Key of Virtue.</hi> Every man ſees 'tis no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of ours, and that we alledge nothing concerning it, but what is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriz'd, by good and real Paſſages, and by the Sentiments and proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the <hi>Greeks</hi> of greateſt account in all Ages. When Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſhall produce as many and ſolid Teſtimonies for his change of Subſtance, we will give him leave to deride our change of virtue, as he is pleaſed to term it. But till then, I have reaſon to deſire him to ſtop his Laughter.</p>
                        <p>I ſhould now paſs on to the proving my Propoſition, <hi>That, the</hi> Greeks <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Bread and Wine only thus become the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt to the Faithful;</hi> but having already eſtabliſhed this Article, in the Sixth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and drawn from thence an Argument, to ſhew they believe not Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, I ſhall therefore for the avoiding needleſs Repetitions, refer the Reader to it.</p>
                        <p>I come then to the laſt Article, which, contains, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> hold the Bread, is made the proper and real Body of Jeſus Chriſt, by means of the addition of his Natural Body. This Point calls for a particular conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for not only, it will further diſcover to us, what the real Opinion of the <hi>Greeks</hi> is; but likewiſe ſhew us, whence come theſe emphatical expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which they ſometimes uſe, in ſaying 'tis the very Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and no other Body than that which was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhew us in what ſence we muſt underſtand them.</p>
                        <p>I. I ſay then, among other Compariſons, the <hi>Greeks</hi> uſe, for the explaining the manner of this change, which happens to the Bread and Wine; they eſpecially imploy, that of Food, which being received by us, is changed into our Bodies. Now, every man knows, that the Matter or Subſtance of Food, is not changed, into the firſt Subſtance which we had before we take it, in ſuch a manner that the one muſt be abſolutely the other, and by a Numerical Identity; on the contrary, each ſubſtance conſerves its proper being, and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:41961:130"/> that of the Food, is joyned to that of our Body, and receives its Form, it aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments it, and by way of Union, Augmentation, and Aſſimilation (as they ſpeak) becomes ours, and makes but one and the ſame Body, and not two, with that which we had before. And this is the Compariſon, the <hi>Greeks</hi> do moſt often urge, whereby to expreſs their Conceptions touching the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. <hi>Theophilact,</hi> in his Commentaries on Saint <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, having told us, the Bread we eat in the Myſteries, is not an Antitype of the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, but the very Fleſh it ſelf, immediately adds theſe Words, <hi>The Bread is changed into the Fleſh of Chriſt, by the Ineffable Words, the Myſtical</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Theophil. 1. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an 6.</note> 
                           <hi>Benediction, and coming of the Holy Spirit. No man ought to be troubled, in being obliged, to believe, that Bread becomes Fleſh. For when our Lord was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant on Earth, and received his nouriſhment from Bread, this Bread he eat, was changed into his Body, being made like unto his Fleſh, and contributed to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſuſtain it after a humane manner. And thus, now, is the Bread changed into our Lord's Fleſh.</hi>

He introduces in one of his Dialogues, a <hi>Saracen</hi> diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">Bibl. Patr. Tom. 2. Graeco-Lat.</note> with him on this Subject. The <hi>Saracen. Tell me, Biſhop; why do ye Prieſts ſo impoſe on other Chriſtians? Of the ſame Flower, you make two Loaves, the one for common uſe, and th'other you divide into ſeveral pieces, diſtributing 'em to the People, which you call the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and perſwade them it confers remiſſion of ſins. Do ye deceive your ſelves, or the People, whoſe Guides you are?</hi> The <hi>Chriſtian. We neither abuſe our ſelves nor others.</hi> The <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen. Prove me this then, not by Scripture, but by reaſon.</hi> The <hi>Chriſtian. What do ye ſay? Is not the Bread made the Body of Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> The <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racen. I know not what to anſwer to that.</hi> The <hi>Chriſtian. When your Mother firſt brought you forth into the World, was you then as big as you are now?</hi> The <hi>Saracen? No, I was born a little one, and became bigger by means of Food, God thus ordering it.</hi> The <hi>Chriſtian. Has the Bread then been made your Body</hi>? The <hi>Saracen. Yes.</hi> The <hi>Chriſtian. And how was this done</hi>? The <hi>Saracen. I know not the manner thereof.</hi> The <hi>Chriſtian. The Bread deſcends into the Stomach, and by the heat of the Liver, the groſſeſt parts ſeparating themſelves, the reſt are converted into Chyle, the Liver attracting them to it, and changing them into Blood, and afterwards diſtributes 'em by means of the Veins, to all the parts of the Body, that they may be what they are, bone to bones, marrow to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, ſinew to ſinews, eye to eyes, hair to hair, nail to nails, and thus by this means the Child grows, and becomes a Man, the Bread being converted in to his Body, and the Drink into his Blood.</hi> The <hi>Saracen. I believe ſo.</hi> The <hi>Chriſtian. Know then that our Myſtery is made after the ſame manner, the Prieſt places Bread and Wine on the Holy Table, and praying, the Holy Spirit deſcends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the efficacy of its Divinity changes them into the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, neither more nor leſs, than the Liver changes the Food into the Body of a Man.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>THIS way of explaining the change of the Bread and Wine, is not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to theſe Authors alone, whom I now alledged. <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> who accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> is to be eſteemed as the common Oracle of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> made uſe of it, in his Fourth Book of the Orthodox Faith. <hi>As in Baptiſm,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Damaſcen. de fide Orthod. lib. 4. cap. 14.</note> ſay's he, <hi>becauſe men are wont to waſh and anoint themſelves, God has added to the Oyl, and Water, the Grace of his Holy Spirit, and made thereof the Laver of our Regeneration: ſo in like manner, becauſe we are wont to eat Bread, and drink Wine and Water; he has joyned to theſe things his Divinity, and made them his Body and Blood, to the end that by things familiar to our nature, he might raiſe us above nature. This is really the Body united to the Divinity, the Body born of the Virgin. Not, that the Body which aſcended up on high, deſcends from Heaven; but becauſe the Bread, and Wine are changed, into the Body and Blood of God. If you ask how this comes to paſs; it will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to tell ye that 'tis by means of the Holy Spirit; and after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as he became Fleſh in the Virgin's Womb. All that we know of it is this, that the Word of God is true, efficacious, and Almighty; and that the manner of this change is inconceiveable. Yet we may ſay, that as naturally the Bread we eat, the Wine and Water we drink, are changed into the Body and Blood of him, that eates and drinks, and yet become not another Body than that which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſo after the ſame manner the Bread and Wine, which are placed on the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, are ſupernaturally changed into the Body and Blood of Jeſus Christ by Prayer, and Deſcenſion of the Holy Spirit; and theſe are not two Bodies, but one and the ſame Body.</hi>

                           <hi>Bread which Jeſus Chriſt eat, was changed into his Body, and received thereby a divine virtue; the ſame likewiſe comes to paſs in the</hi> Euchariſt. <hi>For there, it was the Grace of the Word, that ſanctified the Body, which was nouriſhed with Bread, and was in ſome ſort Bread; and here after the ſame manner, the Bread is ſanctified by the Word of God, and by Prayer; not being in truth made the Body of the Word, by Manducation, but by being changed in an inſtant by the Word into the Body of Chriſt, according to what he ſaid himſelf, this is my Body.</hi>

                        <p>THIS Compariſon does already ſufficiently enough declare the Doctrine of the Greek Church; to wit, that the Subſtance of Bread conſerving its proper being, is joyned to the natural Body of Jeſus Chriſt; that it is made like unto it, that it augments it, and becomes by this means one and the ſame Body with him. For 'tis thus the Aliment we take, (altho it conſerves its own Subſtance and proper being) becomes one with our Body, by way of Addition, or Augmentation.</p>

And this is in my mind as much as can be ſaid with any ſhew of reaſon. We muſt then ſee here, whether in the ſence of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> we may extend the Compariſon of the Food, ſo as to underſtand thereby, that the Bread and Wine are made the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, by way of Augmentation of this Body, for if it appears they take it in this manner, <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Anſwer ſignifies nothing; and our Proof will be compleat and undeniable.</p>

Obſerve here, what he ſay's in his Letter. <hi>Touching the Body of our Lord, of which we partake, I declare to you, it cannot be ſaid there are two Bodies of Jeſus Chriſt; there being but one alone. For as the Child aſſoon as he is born is compleat, but receives his growth from eating and drinking; and altho he grows thereby, yet cannot be ſaid to have two bodies, but only one, ſo by greater reaſon the Bread and Wine, by Deſcent of the Holy Spirit, are made one only Body, and not two by the AUGMENTATION OF THE BODY OF CHRIST.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT to the end it may not be thought this Diſcourſe ſlipt from him una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, obſerve here how he explains, his mind in the following Homily. <hi>This Body, and Blood of our God, of which we partake, is ſubject to Corruption, being broken, ſpilt, eaten, and drunk, and paſſes thro all the natural Oeconomy of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of the Word, which comes to paſs in the ſame manner, as the GROWTH of our Bodies. For as to our Bodies, the firſt thing ſuppoſed, is the matter of which the Embryo conſiſts, afterwards the Mother furniſhing it with the Aliment of her Blood, this matter is changed by little and little, and becomes an organiſed Body, by means of the virtue which our Creature has given to nature. In the ſame manner is formed the Fleſh, Bones, and reſt of the Parts, by the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Faculties deſtini'd for Attraction, Retention, Nouriſhment and Growth. So likewiſe the Food we take, increaſes and augments the maſs of our Body, by the miniſtry of theſe ſame Faculties, deſigned for nouriſhment; which attract, retain, and change the Food. And therefore our Lord ſhews us the whole divine Oeconomy of his Incarnation, Crucifixion, Burial, Reſurrection, and State of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in this GROWTH of his Body. For the Body of our Lord became not immediately incorruptible, but corruptible, and paſſible, till his Reſurrection; and</hi>
                           <pb n="231" facs="tcp:41961:131"/> 
                           <hi>after his Burial became incorruptible, by this ſame Divine Power, by which he raiſed himſelf, and makes us alſo incorruptible: But how comes this to paſs? The Holy Virgin has been as it were the Table whereon was the Subſtance of Bread, when ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſaying of the Angel, the Holy Spirit came upon her, and the virtue of the moſt High overſhadowed her, that is to ſay, the Divine Word, the Divine Perſon who took Fleſh of her. So likewiſe here the Subſtance which is Bread, and Wine mingled with Water, is placed on the Myſtical Table, as it were in the Womb of the Virgin, for even the Virgin was nouriſhed with theſe things, and diſtributed the Subſtance of them to the Body of the Child. In fine, the Prieſt,</hi> he ſay's, <hi>in imitation of the Angel, let the Holy Spirit come upon, and ſanctifie theſe things, and make the Bread, the Sacred Body of Jeſus Chriſt; and the Chalice his precious Blood. Then there is made not by the virtue of nature, but ſupernaturally, and by the AUGMENTATION of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, there is made, I ſay, one only Body, and not two. After this, it is lifted up by the hand of the Prieſt, as he was lifted up on the Croſs, it is diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, broken and buried in us, to make us thereby incorruptible. And thus the Oeconomy is finiſhed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>AND this is the Doctrine of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the Bread, and Wine, are made the Body and Blood of Chriſt, in the ſame manner the Food we receive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes our Body, and this Example or Compariſon exactly comprehends three things. The firſt, that as Nature obſerves the ſame courſe, and performs the ſame Operations in the Food we receive, as it does in the firſt matter of which our Bodies are compoſed; ſo Divine Grace keeps the ſame meaſures, and does the ſame things in the Bread and Wine, as in the Body our Lord took of the Virgin. This is in all reſpects the ſame Oeconomy. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſame Holy Spirit; are corruptible, raiſed up as it were on a Croſs, buried in us, and in fine become incorruptible. The ſecond, that as the Food increaſes, and gives growth to our Bodies; ſo the Bread and myſtical Wine, are a <hi>Growth</hi> or <hi>Augmentation</hi> which the Body of Jeſus Chriſt recieves. The third, that as the Food makes not another Body, but becomes one and the ſame Body with that which it augments; ſo the Myſtery is not a new Body of Jeſus Chriſt, but the ſame which was born of the Virgin.</p>
                        <p>MOREOVER, altho the <hi>Greeks</hi> uſe the Simile of Food, (whereby to explain the manner after which the Bread in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> becomes the Body of Chriſt) yet we muſt not imagine, they believe the Bread receives the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical or natural form of our Lord's Fleſh in the ſame manner the Food re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives that of ours; whether we underſtand by this phyſical Form, the Soul of Jeſus Chriſt, or ſome other ſubſtantial Form ſubordinate to the Soul: This is not at all their Belief; for they only mean, that as the Food we eat receives the phyſical or natural Form of our Body, ſo the Bread in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the impreſſion of the inlivening and ſanctifying <hi>virtue,</hi> reſiding in the natural Body of Chriſt; and that as the Food in receiving the phyſical Form of our Fleſh, becomes an <hi>Augmentation</hi> of our Body; ſo the Bread in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> receiving the impreſſion of the <hi>virtue</hi> of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, becomes an Augmentation. This is a Compariſon, wherein there is ſome proportion of one thing with another, but not an intire reſemblance. The <hi>Greeks</hi> conceive the ſanctifying virtue of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, as its ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural and oeconomical Form, which belongs to it not ſo much for that it is a mere Body, as that it is the <hi>Body of the Word,</hi> the Principle of our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Life and Salvation.</p>
                        <pb n="232" facs="tcp:41961:132"/>
                        <p>THERE is made then according to them, not a Communication, or an extenſion of the natural Form of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt on the Bread; but a communication or an extenſion of its virtue.</p>
                        <p>WHICH plainly appears by what we have already alledged. For firſt, hereto relates this compoſition of Bread and Holy Spirit; and Union of Bread with the Divinity which they aſſert. Secondly, hitherto expresſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, all the Paſſages we have ſeen touching the change of <hi>virtue,</hi> to which the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſo ſtrictly keep themſelves; never mentioning the impreſſion of the phyſical Form, but ever that of <hi>virtue.</hi> Thirdly, we gather the ſame thing from their comparing the Bread in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> with the natural Body, whereby to eſtabliſh how the Bread is made an Augmentation of the Body, they ſay not that the ſame phyſical Form of the one is communicated to the other; but only that the ſame Oeconomy, which is obſerved in the natural Body, is likewiſe obſerved in the Bread. And explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in what conſiſts this ſame Oeconomy; they ſay, 'tis in that the Bread receives the Holy Spirit, as the natural Body receives it, that 'tis raiſed up (as it were) into a Croſs, in the like manner as the natural Body, that 'tis buried in us, and becomes in fine incorruptible, as the natural Body does. Now this is quite different from the impreſſion of the phyſical Form; and gives only the <hi>Idea</hi> of an impreſſion of virtue. Fourthly, the ſame thing appears from a great part of the Proofs I produced in this third Book, as from what they teach touching the unconſecrated Particles; that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in ſome ſort the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, by connection with that which is conſecrated; and that the People may receive them as well as the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for this ſhews they mean the conſecrated Bread becomes only the Body of Jeſus Chriſt by the impreſſion of this ſanctifying virtue of which we ſpeak. And that which they believe touching the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> conſecrated on Holy Thurſday, that 'tis of a more excellent virtue than that of other days; for this would have no ſence, did they hold the impreſſion of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Form of the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt on the Bread. And all the Clauſes of their Liturgies, by which it appears, they reſtrain the effect of the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, to the Bread's becoming the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in Sanctification, and Virtue. And what they ſay touching the dead; that they receive the ſame as we do in the Communion; which would be abſurd if they meant the phyſical Form of the Fleſh of Chriſt was imprinted on the Bread, for the dead receive not this phyſical Form. And their not adoring the Sacrament, with an abſolute Adoration of <hi>Latria,</hi> as do the <hi>Latins,</hi> and as the <hi>Greeks</hi> would do without doubt, if they held the impreſſion of the phyſical Form. And that which the <hi>Greeks</hi> of the Twelfth Century mentioned touching the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> namely, that 'tis not indued with a <hi>Soul, or Underſtanding;</hi> which ſhews clearly, they do not mean the Bread in the Sacrament receives the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Soul of Chriſt. And in fine, that they take ſo little care to preſerve the Subſtance of the Sacrament; uſing it after ſuch a negligent manner, as would be highly criminal and impious, or to ſpeak better, after ſuch a manner as is not conceivable, did they believe the phyſical Form of the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>BUT to finiſh the juſtification of my Propoſition touching the Belief of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> there only remains to be proved, the Compariſon of the Paper, which becomes the Princes Letter, when it receives his Characters or Seal. For as concerning that of the Food, we have already ſufficiently treated on
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:41961:132"/> it; we have likewiſe conſidered that of Wood in conjunction with Fire; that of Wool which takes the dye, and that of Wax or Matter which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the impreſſion of the Seal. As to that of Paper, <hi>Nilus</hi> Abbot of Mount <hi>Sina,</hi> (an Author of the Fifth Century, and who was Saint <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi>'s Schollar) furniſhes us with it, in one of his Epiſtles. <hi>Paper,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>conſiſts of a certain Matter, and is called only Paper, but when the Emperor puts thereunto his Seal or Name, it becomes Sacred. In the ſame manner muſt our Myſteries be conceived. Before the Words of the Prieſt, and Deſcent of the Holy Spirit, 'tis mere Bread and Wine, which are offered; but after the Holy Prayers, and coming of the holy and enlivening Spirit, 'tis no longer mere Bread and Wine, but the pretious and immaculate Body of Jeſus Chriſt, who is God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all, and therefore thoſe that receive them with fear and reverence, are clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from all filthineſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>HAVING thus hiſtorically and ſincerely ſhew'd, the real Belief of the <hi>Greeks</hi> touching the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> it will be no hard matter to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve wherein they agree with the <hi>Latins,</hi> and wherein they differ; which is the ſecond thing I propoſed to do in this Chapter. Firſt, They agree with them, in the general Terms, which denote the change of the Bread and Wine into the Body and Blood of Chriſt. Secondly, They agree in thoſe other expreſſions, which bear, that the change is made into the real Body of Chriſt, into his own proper Body born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and that he has not two Bodies, but one alone. Thirdly, They agree in that both of them attribute this change to the Holy Spirit, who deſcends on the Bread, and makes it the Body of our Lord. Fourthly, They agree in fine, in that they both aſſert, this change to be an effect of the Almighty Power of God, above all the Laws of nature. So far the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> agree.</p>
                        <p>BUT they differ in ſeveral things. Firſt, In that the <hi>Latins</hi> believe, that the Subſtance of Bread ceaſes, the <hi>Greeks</hi> on the contrary believe its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence. Which we plainly gather from the Propoſition I now eſtabliſhed, and the Proofs I offered: For ſeeing they make the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to conſiſt of the compoſition of a ſenſible Subſtance, which is the Bread, and the Holy Spirit, as we have already obſerved, ſeeing they joyn the Bread to the Divinity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that what reſults thence is double, that is to ſay, that it has two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it is clear the <hi>Greeks</hi> hold that the Nature or Subſtance of Bread re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains. This ſame truth appears likewiſe, concerning what they hold touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Augmentation of the Body of Chriſt. For if the Bread in the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt</hi> augments, or gives growth to our Lord's Body, as they believe, it ceaſes not to be, being certain, that to make an Augmentation, we muſt add one thing to another, joyn them together, conſerve them both, and deſtroy neither of them. To this we are moreover led by all thoſe Compariſons we find they uſed, of Wool dyed, of Paper that receives the Emperors Signet, of Wax that receives the impreſſion of the Seal, of a burning Coal, or Wood in conjunction with Fire, and Food by which we are nouriſhed; for in all theſe Examples, the ſubject matter looſes nothing of its firſt Subſtance. Moreover ſeeing they will have the Bread paſs thro all the Degrees of the Oeconomy of Jeſus Chriſt, that 'tis firſt corruptible, then incorruptible, this ſufficiently denotes they mean the Bread remains, whereby to receive all theſe changes.</p>
                        <p>SECONDLY, From this difference there ariſes another, which is, that the <hi>Latins</hi> believe that in the change which happens in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi>
                           <pb n="234" facs="tcp:41961:133"/> the Subſtance of Bread, and that of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, are (as they ſpeak) the two Terms of the change, and that of the Bread paſſes intirely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that of the Body by a Converſion, not only myſtical, but really, and which deſtroys the Exiſtence, or matter of the Bread, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Which appears by this Augmentation of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, of which they tell us, and which they confirm by the Simile of Food. For common ſence plainly ſhews us, that that which augments a thing is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally changed into the thing augmented, as the <hi>Latins</hi> underſtand their change. For there muſt always be reckoned a real difference between the thing augmented, and that which augments. The Opinion of the <hi>Greeks</hi> then can in no wiſe agree with that of the <hi>Latins,</hi> for according to the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,</hi> the Subſtance of the natural Body of Jeſus Chriſt receives neither more, nor leſs, by the Converſion of the Subſtance of Bread into it, and according to the <hi>Greeks</hi> it is augmented by it.</p>
                        <p>THIRDLY, It muſt then be granted, the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not acknowledge this converſion, ſpecified by the Roman Church; and differ from it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the nature or kind of this change, admitting only that of an Object, which receiving a new Form, remains what it was before; and yet becomes what it was not, which is to ſay, that the Bread remaining Bread, receives the ſupernatural and oeconomical Form of the Body of Chriſt, that is to ſay its virtue, and is thereby made this Body. And this is what is meant by this change of Sanctification and Virtue, which they eſtabliſh, and by which they pretend the Bread becomes our Lord's Body. Their whole Doctrine centers in this, and 'tis not poſſible to ſee what I alledged from them in this Chapter, and not make this Concluſion, that their Opinion is, there only happens in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> a change of virtue, and that 'tis only thus, the ſame Subſtance, which is Bread, is likewiſe the Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>FOURTHLY, The <hi>Latins</hi> hold that the Subſtance we receive in the Sacrament is abſolutely the ſame numerical Subſtance which our Saviour had when he was on Earth, and which he ſtill retains in Heaven. The <hi>Greeks</hi> hold not this, their Hypotheſis manifeſtly oppoſes it. For altho they ſay the Body born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Bread in the Sacrament, are not two Bodies, but one, yet the manner after which they explain this Unity, and the reaſon they give for it, do clearly denote they mean not thereby an abſolute Unity, nor an intire or numerical Identity, (as the Schools ſpeak) ſuch as the <hi>Latins</hi> eſtabliſh. They ſay, that as that which a Child eats and drinks makes not another Body, but the ſame, altho he receives growth thereby; ſo the Bread in the Sacrament, which augments the Body of Chriſt; makes not two Bodies, but one. Now this neceſſarily ſuppoſes, that this Subſtance which we receive with the mouths of our Bodies in the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,</hi> is different from that which our Saviour had on Earth, and which he ſtill has in Heaven. For a Body that is augmented is the ſame it was before; but the Augmentation can never be abſolutely the ſame thing, as that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives Augmentation. In effect, if the <hi>Latins</hi> be asked, and all thoſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Hypotheſis, why the Bread in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and the Body born of the Virgin, are not two, but one only Body, they will anſwer, 'Tis becauſe they are but one and the ſame Subſtance in number. But inſtead of this the <hi>Greeks</hi> take a different courſe, ſaying, 'tis becauſe the Bread is an Augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Body of Chriſt, which puts a real difference between the two Subſtances. Whence it follows, that that which they believe they receive in the Sacrament, is not the ſame Subſtance as that of our Lord's natural Body.</p>
                        <pb n="235" facs="tcp:41961:133"/>
                        <p>FIFTHLY, Hence it appears, the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not believe the <hi>Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> of the <hi>Latins.</hi> For the <hi>Latins</hi> by the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> mean a <hi>Preſence</hi> of <hi>Substance;</hi> which is to ſay, that this ſame Subſtance of the natural Body of Jeſus Chriſt, in which he lived and died, and roſe again, and which now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts in Heaven, the ſame I ſay in <hi>Number,</hi> really likewiſe exiſts, ſubſtantially, and by it ſelf in the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> Now this the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not hold, as I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewed. They on the contrary believe that this Subſtance we receive in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and that of the natural Body of Chriſt, are two Subſtances really different, one of which is the Augmentation, and th'other the thing augmented, the one a true Subſtance of Bread, and th'other the Subſtance of the natural Body of Chriſt: The one, to wit, that of Bread, receives accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them the impreſſion of the virtue of th'other, and the other communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates this to it. They do not then believe, that this ſame natural Body of Chriſt, this ſame numerical Subſtance in which he died, and roſe again, and which now exiſts in Heaven, does likewiſe really exiſt in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> which is exactly, as I already ſaid, the real Preſence of the <hi>Latins.</hi> They hold the Bread, becomes by Conſecration, not a <hi>Figure</hi> of the Body of Chriſt, but an <hi>Augmentation,</hi> inaſmuch as it receives its <hi>Virtue and Efficacy.</hi> If this muſt be called a kind of <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> I ſay, this is but a mere amuſement of Words, not worth our conſideration. In ſhort, the <hi>Preſence</hi> of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> is a <hi>Preſence</hi> of <hi>Virtue,</hi> that of the <hi>Latins</hi> a <hi>Preſence</hi> of <hi>Subſtance;</hi> ſo that upon this account they are at a great difference. In effect, if the things I alledged, as well in this Chapter, as in this whole Third Book, be exactly conſidered, it will appear, that the moſt part of the Proofs I produced to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> believe not Tranſubſtantiation, do equally conclude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Subſtantial Preſence; and that they alſo believe not, there is made any impreſſion of the phyſical Form of Chriſt's Body on the Bread.</p>
                        <p>SIXTHLY, Theſe principal and eſſential differences, produce others. For it hence appears, that altho they agree with the <hi>Latins</hi> in theſe general expreſſions, which bear, that the Bread is changed into the Body of Chriſt, into his real Body, into his own proper Body, yet they differ from them in the ſence of theſe expreſſions, underſtanding them in a quite different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. For the <hi>Latins</hi> mean the Bread is changed into the Body by a real Tranſubſtantiation, which making the Subſtance of Bread ceaſe, becomes the proper ſubſtance of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, the ſame in number which it was before. The <hi>Greeks</hi> on the contrary mean, that the Bread, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bread in its proper Subſtance, is changed into the proper Body of Chriſt, in aſmuch as that 'tis made an increaſe or augmentation, by the impreſſion it receives from its virtue. So that when both one and the other ſay, the Bread is the Body of Chriſt, they in no ſort agree, in the ſence of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; the <hi>Latins</hi> underſtanding it in a divided ſence (as they term it) which is to ſay, that that which was before Bread is now no longer ſo, but the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; the <hi>Greeks</hi> on the contrary, that that which is ſtill Bread, is alſo this Body.</p>
                        <p>VII. THE <hi>Latins</hi> following their Hypotheſis, are forced to admit the Exiſtence of Accidents without a Subject, the <hi>Greeks</hi> are not. Whence it is, they never mention this pretended Exiſtence, and we find no ſuch thing in their Authors.</p>
                        <p>VIII. THE <hi>Latins</hi> are obliged to give a reaſon for ſeveral natural Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:41961:134"/> which denote, that the Subſtance of Bread remains, and which ſeem incompatible with their Belief, as that our Bodies are nouriſhed with the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> that it breeds Maggots in it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in which they are extreamly puzled. The <hi>Greeks</hi> are not ſo, neither do we find the leaſt hint thereof in their Books.</p>
                        <p>IX. THE <hi>Latins</hi> cannot but admit the Exiſtence of the ſame Body in ſeveral places at once; The <hi>Greeks</hi> know not any thing of this, neither are they concerned at it.</p>
                        <p>X. THE <hi>Latins</hi> are forced to make the Body of Chriſt exiſt in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, void of his natural proportion and properties. The <hi>Greeks</hi> do not ſo, and therefore we ſee them never troubled at theſe difficulties which follow the Doctrine of the <hi>Latins.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>XI. THE <hi>Latins</hi> by an unavoidable conſequence of their Doctrine, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore with a Sovereign Adoration the <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> which is according to them the proper Subſtance of our Lord's natural Body, ſeparate from any other Subſtance. The <hi>Greeks</hi> do not ſo, as we obſerved in the ſeventh Chapter.</p>
                        <p>XII. THE <hi>Latins,</hi> believe the wicked receive the Body, and Blood of Chriſt, with the mouths of their bodies, altho to their condemnation. The <hi>Greeks</hi> hold that the Bread and Wine are made this Body and Blood, only to the Faithful.</p>
                        <p>NOT to inſiſt on ſeveral other differences, which do not preciſely relate to our Queſtion, as that the <hi>Greeks</hi> do all of 'em communicate of both kinds, whereas the <hi>Latins</hi> give only to the People that of Bread; that the <hi>Greeks</hi> hold the Conſecration is performed by the Prayer of the Prieſt, and the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi> on the contrary by theſe Words, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> that the <hi>Latins</hi> uſe Wafers, or unleavened Bread, whereas the <hi>Greeks</hi> abhorring the <hi>Azymes</hi> uſe only that which is leavened. There are likewiſe ſeveral other differences which I ſhall not here repeat, becauſe the Reader may find them, in what has been already ſaid in the foregoing Chapters.</p>
                        <p>AND here have I repreſented, as exactly as I could, the Differences and Agreements of the two Churches. If it be now demanded in what Points we agree with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> this may be eaſily collected from what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid.</p>
                        <p>WE agree almoſt with them in all Points wherein they differ from the <hi>Latins.</hi> 1. In that we do not believe the Converſion of Subſtances, any more than they, nor admit, the ſubſtantial Preſence of the Natural Body of Chriſt, under the Species of Bread and Wine, that we adore not the Sacrament, nor acknowledge any of the Conſequences of the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. We agree with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> in that they conceive the change which is made in the Bread and Wine, to be a change of virtue by the efficacy of the Holy Spirit, God not deſtroying the Nature of Bread and Wine, but adding his Grace to Nature. 3. In that, we do not believe any more than they, that the wicked receive the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. 4. In that we believe with them, that we ought to communicate of both kinds. 5. In our holding the Conſecration is performed by Prayer. 6. In fine, that we deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Sacrament in leavened Bread, altho we hold the uſe of the <hi>Azyme</hi> an indifferent thing.</p>
                        <pb n="237" facs="tcp:41961:134"/>
                        <p>YET it muſt not be imagined, we pretend there's no difference in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and ours. I do not believe any of our Doctors ever aſſerted ſuch a thing. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would make the World believe I maintained this, and has triumphed thereupon in ſeveral places of his Book, as if I ſuppoſed the <hi>Greeks</hi> were <hi>Berengarians</hi> or <hi>Calviniſts.</hi> But this is a groundleſs charge. I only denied that the <hi>Greeks</hi> (which are called Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks) believed Tranſubſtantiation, and the Adoration. It belongs to him therefore to ſee whether he had reaſon to accuſe me in this of <hi>raſhneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable boldneſs,</hi> or whether he himſelf rather was not guilty of this, when he bragged of <hi>confounding Miniſters</hi> with the number of his Proofs. Perhaps he would have hit better on it, had he ſaid he had confounded his Readers. But to let this paſs, I ſhall here truly denote the principal differences between the Doctrine of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and ours.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. THE <hi>Greeks,</hi> ſince the Eighth Century, rejected the Terms of <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Figure,</hi> in reference to the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> altho they uſe them of <hi>Symbol</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation.</hi> We admit equally both as the Fathers of the firſt ſix Ages e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. THEY ſeem willing to keep in ſome ſort the literal ſence of theſe Words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> which we do not. For we underſtand 'em in this ſence, this Bread is the Sacred Sign, or the Sacrament of my Body; or which is to the ſame effect, the Bread ſignifies my Body. They on the contrary, taking the Term <hi>eſt</hi> in ſome ſort according to the Letter, will have the ſame Subſtance, which is Bread, to be alſo the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſo often ſay, that the Bread is, not the Figure of the Body, but the Body, not the Figure of the Fleſh, but the Fleſh it ſelf, becauſe the Lord did not ſay, this is the Figure of my Body, but this is my Body. Whereunto relates that ſaying of <hi>Theophilact,</hi> we already cited, which is, <hi>we muſt not be troubled to believe Bread is Fleſh.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">III. 'TIS likewiſe to keep this pretended literal ſence, that they would have the Bread to be made one with the Body by its Union to the Divinity, by the impreſſion of the Holy Spirit, and by a change of virtue. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they bring the compariſon of Food, which becomes one with our Bodies; and invented this way of <hi>Growth</hi> or <hi>Augmentation</hi> of a natural Body: for all this ends only in eſtabliſhing a Unity between the Bread, and the Body, which may make us ſay literally, and without recourſe to a Figure, that the Bread is the Body. As to what concerns us, we need not take ſuch a great circuit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Queſtion, concerning a Sacrament, we believe we may take the Words of Chriſt in a ſacramental and figurative ſence.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. IT ſeems likewiſe, that the Modern <hi>Greeks</hi> underſtand ſome real or phyſical impreſſion, of the Holy Spirit, and inlivening virtue of Jeſus Chriſt, on the Bread, with ſome kind of inherency; yet I will not poſitively affirm this was the general Belief of their Church, altho their expreſſions intimate as much. But howſoever, this is not our Opinion. We do indeed believe, that the Grace of the Holy Spirit, and virtue of Chriſt's Body accompany the right uſe of the Sacrament, and that in the Communion we participate of the Body of Chriſt by Faith in as great a meaſure; and more really than if we received him with the Mouth of our Bodies, but we hold not this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, or real inherence of virtue, which it ſeems the <hi>Greeks</hi> admit;
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:41961:135"/> whence it happens that our expreſſions are not ſo emphatical as theirs.</p>
                        <p>AND this is what I had to ſay touching the real Opinion of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> with its principal Circumſtances, and in reference to that of ours, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s. I do not doubt but ſeveral People reading this Chapter, will ſay, I charge the <hi>Greeks</hi> with a very fooliſh and unreaſonable Doctrine. They'l make Objections touching this compoſition of Bread and Holy Spirit, this Union of the Symbols with the Divinity, and eſpecially concerning this manner of being the Body and Blood of Chriſt, by way of Growth or Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation. But to this I need ſay no more, than that it concerns me not to juſtifie the Opinion of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> Our buſineſs here is to know what it is, and not whether it be juſtifiable, nor to anſwer the Objections may be made againſt it, becauſe we adopt not either their Expreſſions or Opinions. Yet I ſhall endeavour to ſolve two difficulties, which may trouble the Readers; the one is, that according to the Hypotheſis of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> it ſeems as if it might be ſaid in ſome ſence, that the Bread is changed into the Subſtance of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, after the ſame manner we ſay the Bread we eat is changed into our Subſtance. Th'other is, that by this Union of Bread to the Divinity, it ſeems they underſtand a real hypoſtatical Union, like unto that which joyns the natural Body to the Word.</p>
                        <p>TO the firſt I anſwer, the <hi>Greeks</hi> mean not the Bread receives the natural or phyſical form of the Fleſh of Chriſt, as we have proved; neither do they ſay, the Bread is changed into the Subſtance of the Body of Chriſt, becauſe this way of ſpeaking, which we uſe in reſpect of the Bread we eat is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Food's receiving the Subſtantial or phyſical form of our Fleſh. Now they mean no other impreſſion on the Bread in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> than an impreſſion of the inlivening virtue of Chriſt's Body by means of the Holy Spirit. And thus the Bread keeps its proper and natural Subſtance wholly intire, and yet is augmented by an Augmentation of the Body of Chriſt, in aſmuch as the ſupernatural virtue which is proper to this Body is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Bread. As to what remains, altho this pretended Augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, by means of the Bread is abſurd enough, yet we may give it a plain ſence, in ſaying 'tis not neceſſary for this that the Bread and Body be locally joyned, it being ſufficient to conceive the Holy Spirit is the mutual link which unites them together, and the Bread receiving only the virtue of the Body, by a dependance thereon, and in aſmuch as 'tis the Myſtery of it, this is a kind of Growth and Augmentation, a Myſtery being as it were an Appendix, or Circumſtance to the thing of which 'tis the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.</p>
                        <p>TO the ſecond Queſtion, I anſwer, that altho the whole Hypotheſis of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and eſpecially ſome of their expreſſions, ſeem to induce us to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to 'em the Belief of the hypoſtatical Union of Bread to the Divinity, yet their Authors not plainly expreſſing themſelves in this matter, and it not appearing elſewhere by their practice, that they hold this Opinion, there is more juſtice in not charging them with it, than in imputing it to 'em, and ſo much the more, becauſe there is none of their uſual expreſſions, how empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſoever, but may agree with a ſimple Union of efficacy. The Term of <hi>Aſſumption</hi> uſed by <hi>Damaſcen, Panis &amp; Vinum, <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, aſſumuntur,</hi> induced me to believe at firſt with Mr. <hi>Aubertin,</hi> he meant thereby a real hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatical <note place="margin">Lib. 4. de Fid. Orth. cap. 14.</note> Aſſumption, but having ſince carefully examined this Paſſage, it ſeemed to me this <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, may be eaſily referred not to the foregoing
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:41961:135"/> Words in the ſame Diſcourſe, but to that which follows in the ſimple ſence, <hi>That the Bread and Wine are uſed in the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>becauſe they are things fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to us.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT howſoever, we may here obſerve, that ever ſince both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> deviated from the ſimplicity of the Goſpel; and natural Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which the Ancients gave this Myſtery; how they have fallen, I ſay, into vainand idle Speculations, both of 'em wandring from the Truth. Which commonly happens to ſuch as love rather to follow their own imaginations, than the Word of God. Our Saviour tells us concerning the Sacrament, that 'tis his Body, and added, that it was for a remembrance of him; and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> thus commented on it, This is a Declaration of the Lord's death till his coming. What could be more eaſie than to keep here, and to judge thereof by the very nature of a Sacrament, by the expreſſions of our Saviour, and his Apoſtle, and other parts of Chriſtian Religion? But inſtead of this, we have abuſed ſeveral exceſſive expreſſions of the Fathers, taking no notice of divers others, by which they explain themſelves; theſe have been extended, and altho innocent, yet are made a Rock of Offence. The <hi>Latins</hi> proceed to a real Preſence, a real Tranſubſtantiation, and Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents without a Subject, and all the reſt of thoſe Doctrines unknown to the Ancients, which they heap up without number. The <hi>Greeks</hi> on their ſide have imagined a Union of the Bread with the Divinity, a kind of real im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of ſupernatural virtue of Chriſt's Body on the Bread, a Growth, or Augmentation of this Body.</p>
                        <p>I hope I ſhall have this Juſtice done me, that it will be acknowledged, I have produced nothing touching the Doctrine of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> but what has been taken out of their beſt Authors, from them I ſay that are of greateſt account amongſt them. And 'tis in fine from their proper Teſtimonies, I have clearly ſhown, that that which the <hi>Greeks</hi> hold touching the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> is not the Tranſubſtantiation of the <hi>Latins;</hi> which is the chief and only thing I had to do. Yet ſhall I anſwer in the following Book all Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s vain Objections; as briefly as I can; for conſidering what I already eſtabliſhed, 'tis eaſie to judge, that his Arguments will not prove invincible Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as he would perſwade the World.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Firſt Proof, taken from <hi>Cerularius</hi> his Silence, exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The reſt of his Illuſions diſcovered.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>AFter what I have eſtabliſhed in the two former Books, it will be no difficult matter, to anſwer, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Objections, and ſhew as I promiſed, that all his endeavours to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Greek Church ever believed Tranſubſtantiation are ineffectual, and that the greateſt part of his Proofs conclude the contrary of what he pretends. And this ſhall be the ſubject of this Book. Which I ſhall divide into two Parts; in the firſt, I ſhall examine what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has alledged, to prove his ſuppoſition ſince the Eleventh Century to this preſent; and in the ſecond, conſider what he has alledged for the ſame purpoſe from the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth and Tenth Centuries.</p>
                        <p>IN the firſt Part of this Book, I ſhall handle four principal Heads, under which I ſhall exactly gather whatſoever Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has diſperſed in his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, Third, and Fourth Books, and part of his Twelfth Book, wherein he has treated on ſome Particulars, reſpecting this Queſtion.</p>
                        <p>OUR firſt Remark ſhall be touching ſome of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Deluſions, beſides thoſe we already diſcovered, in the former Books. It is certain we may juſtly ſo term all the Parts of his Work, but more eſpecially, what he has written touching the <hi>Greeks;</hi> for 'tis all deluſory. But at preſent we mean to apply this Term to certain things only, wherein his Artifice plainly appears, and which are wholly inconſiſtent with that ſincerity, wherewith Controverſies ought to be managed.</p>
                        <p>THE ſecond Head contains the Teſtimonies of ſome Proteſtants, whom Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has alledged; which ſeem in effect to attribute to the <hi>Greeks</hi> the Belief of Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
                        <p>THE Third, ſhall contain the Negative Arguments, drawn from the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of both <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Latins;</hi> that is to ſay, they never diſputed one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another, on this Article, of the Converſion of Subſtances in the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt.</hi>

                        <pb n="242" facs="tcp:41961:137"/>
                        <p>IN the Fourth, we ſhall explain, all the Paſſages Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has taken out of Greek Authors, and from which he would infer by dint of Argument, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> hold this Converſion of Subſtances.</p>
                        <p>TO begin at his Deluſions, the Firſt, or to ſpeak better, the Twelfth, (after thoſe we already diſcovered) conſiſts, in that he would have us upon the account of his own bare word, without any Proof, ſuppoſe, that when <hi>Michael Cerularius,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Acrida,</hi> wrote their Letter againſt the Church of <hi>Rome, Leo</hi> the Ninth, the then preſent Pope had already condemned <hi>Berengarius;</hi> and that the <hi>Greeks</hi> could not be ignorant of this cenſure. But 'twill not be amiſs to hear him ſpeak himſelf, <hi>To ſhew,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>the conſent of the Greek Church with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 5. pag. 139.</note> 
                           <hi>in the Subject of the</hi> Euchariſt; <hi>we have made uſe (in the refutation of Mr.</hi> Claude'<hi>s Anſwer) of the conteſt which aroſe in the year 1053. between</hi> Michael Cerularius, <hi>Patriarch of</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>and</hi> Leo <hi>Archbiſhop of</hi> Acrida <hi>on one hand, and Pope Leo the Ninth, and the whole Latine Church on the other. For theſe Perſons altho ſuch paſſionate adverſaries againſt the Weſtern Church, upon the account of the Azymes, yet never reproached her as erring in the Myſtery of the</hi> Euchariſt; <hi>altho they wrote againſt the</hi> Latins, <hi>AT THE SAME TIME, AND AFTER, Pope</hi> Leo <hi>had cenſured</hi> Berengarius, <hi>in two Councils of</hi> Italy, <hi>the one held at</hi> Rome, <hi>th'other at</hi> Verſeil; <hi>whence we conclude they were agreed with the Latin Church in the Doctrine of the real Preſence, which ſhe ſo loudly aſſerted at that time.</hi> This is Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s firſt Proof, which he has ſet forth to the life, in the beſt colours wherewith his Eloquence could furniſh him; having turned it ſeveral wayes by his uſual dexterary, in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifying, and exaggerating the Subjects he handles.</p>
                        <p>IT is certain that to make this Argument valid, he muſt clearly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh before all things, that, <hi>Berengarius</hi> his Condemnation preceded <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rularius,</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> of <hi>Acrida</hi>'s Letter, and preceded it to, a very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time; to ſhew that theſe Prelates were well informed of it, and had reaſon to mention it in their Letter; for without this, we can conclude nothing from their Silence. Yet Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has not troubled himſelf with the clearing up this matter of Fact; contenting himſelf in ſaying only, that <hi>Cerularius,</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> of <hi>Acrida</hi> wrote againſt the <hi>Latins at the ſame time, and a little after</hi> Pope <hi>Leo</hi> condemned <hi>Berengarius,</hi> in two Councils of <hi>Italy.</hi> A man would then think, this was a Point out of doubt, and at which Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> has no need to ſtop a moment, having judged it evident (beyond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction) in his Chronology. But he will be much ſtartled to find, there is nothing more uncertain, than his ſuppoſition; and moreover, that there is nothing more unlikely than what he ſay's.</p>
                        <p>TO be aſcertained in this Matter, we muſt know, that <hi>Cerularius,</hi> and <hi>Leo d' Acrida</hi>'s Letter was written in the Year, 1053. as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> and all the World grants. We muſt moreover know, that although <hi>Baronius,</hi> and <hi>Binius</hi> attribute the two Condemnations of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> to the Year, 1050. 3 Years before <hi>Cerularius</hi> his Letter was written, yet there are Authors that are better informed in this Matter than <hi>Baronius,</hi> and <hi>Binius;</hi> who refer theſe two Condemnations to the Year 1053. being exactly the ſame Year wherein the Letter was written. And theſe are ſuch Authors, whoſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony will go far with Mr. <hi>Arnaud.</hi> Being thoſe that publiſhed <hi>the Office of the B. Sacrament,</hi> that is to ſay, this ſame Office, to which, the firſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> in its primary Deſign, was to ſerve as a Preface; as
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:41961:137"/> a Preface; as we have been already twice informed. Obſerve here, what they ſay, <hi>Neither</hi> Malmesbury, <hi>nor</hi> Baronius, <hi>have exactly obſerved all the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Office of the B. Sacrament, Hiſt. and Chron. 11. Cent.</note> 
                           <hi>Councils, which were called touching this Hereſie of</hi> Berengarius. <hi>The firſt of them, was held at</hi> Rome, <hi>by Pope</hi> Leo <hi>the Ninth; the ſecond at</hi> Verſeil, <hi>in the Month of</hi> September, <hi>in the ſame Year, under the ſame Pope. We cannot doubt, (after the Teſtimony of</hi> Lanfranc) <hi>in his Book againſt</hi> Berengarius, <hi>but that theſe two Councils were held both in the ſame Year. But ſome, (as</hi> Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us <hi>and</hi> Binius) <hi>will have this Year to be 1050. others the Year, 1053. Firſt, becauſe</hi> Sigibert <hi>ſay's, that Pope</hi> Leo <hi>held two Councils, in 1050. but he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerves likewiſe this was only to reform the abuſes of the Eccleſiaſticks; and ſpeaks not of the Troubles raiſed by</hi> Berengarius <hi>his Hereſie, but only as hapning in the Year, 1051. Secondly, becauſe</hi> Durand <hi>Abbot of</hi> Trorand <hi>in</hi> Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>who lived about that time, refers the Council of</hi> Verſeil, <hi>to the Year 1053. on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And there is no reaſon to pretend, as a Learned Lawyer of</hi> Angers <hi>does, that there is a miſtake, in this Paſſage of</hi> Durand; <hi>and that we muſt read 1050. ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that according to the judicious Obſervation of Mr.</hi> de St. Beuve, <hi>the King's Profeſſor at</hi> Sorbornne; <hi>in a Manuſcript on this Matter, the ſame</hi> Durand <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies, that in the Year he ſpeaks of,</hi> Alfred <hi>was Abbot of the Abby of</hi> Preaux <hi>in</hi> Normandy, <hi>which was not founded till the Year 1053. according to</hi> Du Bec'<hi>s Chronicle.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>HERE then we have upon good Grounds, and undeniable Authority, the two Condemnations of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> referred to the ſame Year, in which <hi>Cerularius,</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> of <hi>Acrida</hi> wrote their Letter. It remains only to know, whether Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> may ſuppoſe without Proof, that the Letter was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten after <hi>Berengarius</hi> his Condemnation; and whether 'tis not a plain Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, thus ſlightly to paſs over a Point of this importance, on which depends the greateſt part of his reaſoning. For, if this Letter was written, before the time wherein <hi>Berenger</hi> was firſt condemned; what can be then concluded from <hi>Cerularius,</hi> and <hi>Leo de Acrida</hi>'s Silence? Wherefore muſt they ground an Accuſation, againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> on a Condemnation which was not then in being. Now this is a matter of Fact, which I affirm to be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; and which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> muſt demonſtrate, and not ſuppoſe, without Proof. <hi>They wrote,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>againſt the</hi> Latins, <hi>at the ſame time, and a little after, Pope</hi> Leo <hi>had condemned</hi> Berengarius, <hi>in two Councils of</hi> Italy, <hi>the one held at</hi> Rome, <hi>th'other at</hi> Verſeil. There being but one Letter, from both <hi>Cerularius,</hi> and <hi>Leo d' Acrida;</hi> we muſt conceive, 'twas written to the Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> after <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarius</hi> his firſt Condemnation, and near the time they were about calling th'other Council at <hi>Verſeil.</hi> Now this has no likelihood, for as <hi>Baronius</hi> has well <note place="margin">Baron ann. Eccleſ. ad ann. 1053.</note> obſerved, <hi>Leo</hi> anſwered this Letter in the ſame Year, namely, 1053. whence it follows, if we reckon right, we ſhall find, that <hi>Cerularius,</hi> and <hi>Leo d' Acrida</hi> could not have written their Letter, but in the beginning of the Year, at fartheſt, and conſequently before there was any mention at <hi>Rome</hi> of <hi>Berengarius</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; and eſpecially before the news thereof came to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> In effect it muſt not be imagined, that this Patriarch, and Archbiſhop, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Letter without mature and deliberate advice, and conſideration, nor that they ſent it without communicating the Contents of it to ſome of their Clergy, to bring them to take part with them, and engage 'em in their Intereſts; ſeeing the matter concerned the cenſuring of a Church, ſuch as that of the <hi>Latins,</hi> and which, they were ſure would highly reſent it; Affairs of this importance are not wont to be precipitated. It required alſo ſome time, before this Letter could come from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to <hi>Tranys</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples. John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Tranys,</hi> to whom 'twas directed, muſt likewiſe
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:41961:138"/> have ſome time, to ſend it to Cardinal <hi>Humbert,</hi> and he, muſt get it tranſlated out of <hi>Greek</hi> into <hi>Latin. Humbert</hi> muſt go to <hi>Rome,</hi> for he carried it himſelf to Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> after he received it from the Biſhop of <hi>Tranys.</hi> In fine, <hi>Leo</hi> muſt examine it, and anſwer it; For all which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> allows but three Months. <hi>Cerularius,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>and</hi> Leo <hi>of</hi> Acrida, <hi>wrote againſt the</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins, <note place="margin">Baron. ad ann. 1053.</note> 
                           <hi>and at the ſame time, and not long after again, Pope</hi> Leo <hi>condemned</hi> Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius, <hi>in two Councils of</hi> Italy, <hi>the one held at</hi> Rome, <hi>th'other at</hi> Verſeil. This <hi>not long after,</hi> can only relate to the Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> which was the firſt, and conſequently this, <hi>at the ſame time,</hi> muſt relate to the Council of <hi>Verſeil,</hi> which being not called till <hi>September,</hi> as appears by <hi>Lanfranc,</hi> who poſitively affirmeth it; and the Pope having wrote his Anſwer at fartheſt in <hi>December,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">infr. de. corp. ſang. Dom.</note> it muſt needs be, (if we believe what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſuppoſes) that is to ſay, if the Letter was written in the Month of <hi>September,</hi> that all that which I come now from obſerving, was tranſacted in three Months time. And thus does Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> haſten the time, that it may anſwer his neceſſities.</p>
                        <p>TO this Deluſion, we may add another, which will be the Thirteenth. It conſiſts in ſuppoſing, without Proof, that <hi>Leo</hi> the Ninth in condemning <hi>Berengarius,</hi> preciſely eſtabliſhed Tranſubſtantiation, and the real Preſence. For if we take not this Fact for a certain Principle, there can be no Pretence for demanding, wherefore <hi>Cerularius</hi> reproached not the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> about her erring in the Doctrine of the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>YET is there nothing more uncertain, for, there are none of the Decrees of this Council extant, and I think not one Author that relates the proper Terms of theſe Condemnations. They tell us, that <hi>Berengarius</hi> was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that <hi>John Scot</hi>'s Book was burnt, but this is not ſufficient to conclude, that Tranſubſtantiation, and the real Preſence were eſtabliſhed, in Terms which might offend <hi>Cerularius,</hi> and the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and give them occaſion to form an Accuſation againſt the Roman Church. Sober men are not wont to accuſe People upon confuſed Reports, and equivocal Terms. And it will be to no purpoſe to ſay, we muſt not doubt, but that <hi>Leo</hi>'s intention was, to aſſert the ſubſtantial Converſion, againſt <hi>Berengarius;</hi> ſeeing <hi>Lanfranc</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, that he himſelf having declared in full Council his Belief touching the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> in oppoſition to that of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> it was approved, and the other rejected as erroneous. For he that ſtates an Opinion contradictory to that of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> does not neceſſarily aſſert Tranſubſtantiation, there being ſeveral other ways and means of oppoſition. It concerns us not here to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our ſelves from <hi>Lanfranc,</hi> what was the ſence of the Synod, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what came to <hi>Cerularius</hi> his knowledge concerning that matter was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make him ſay, thoſe People eſtabliſhed a real Converſion of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Now to imagine, as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does, that a Patriarch which is at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> can make ſuch a Judgment with Diſcretion, it will not be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to inform him of the intention and ſecret deſign of the <hi>Latins</hi> (altho even this is not to be ſuppoſed without Proof) but he muſt have before him the diſtinct and expreſs Terms relating to this Affair, and this Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> cannot prove, ſeeing there is no ſuch matter extant.</p>
                        <p>HE will ſay without doubt, that this is a very <hi>ſtrange thing</hi> (for whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever falls not under his ſence is <hi>ſtrange)</hi> to affirm that a Pope and Council that intended to eſtabliſh Tranſubſtantiation in condemning <hi>Berengarius,</hi> yet have not done it in intelligible Terms. Neither will he forget to cenſure me here a little (as he is wont at every pinch) ſaying, <hi>I conſider the matters I</hi>
                           <pb n="245" facs="tcp:41961:138"/> 
                           <hi>write in a ſuperficial view only, not penetrating into the bottom of things, and that occaſions my falling into ſuch idle fancies; that I multiply my may-be-ſo's; and am one of the boldeſt and fruitfulleſt men in the World, in Hypotheſiſes and Syſtems.</hi> To which I have nothing to anſwer, but that in the Year, 1059. <note place="margin">Baron. ad ann. 1059.</note> ſix years after the Synods held by Pope <hi>Leo, Nicholas</hi> the Second, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned likewiſe <hi>Berengarius,</hi> in another Synod held at <hi>Rome,</hi> and made him ſign a Formulary of Abjuration, and that according to <hi>Lanfranc,</hi> they earneſtly deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Lanfr. de corp. &amp; ſang. Dum. lib. 2. cap. 5.</note> to eſtabliſh the real Converſion of Subſtances in this Formulary; that Cardinal <hi>Humbert,</hi> who drew it up, did firmly believe this Doctrine, as Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> proteſts for him, and yet for all this, it was aſſerted only in ambiguous Terms, which might be expounded in a ſence that does not at all contradict the Doctrine of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> ſeeing <hi>Berengarius</hi> himſelf turned them to his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. And in effect, the Formulary bears, <hi>That the Bread and Wine are after</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lanfr. de corp. &amp; ſang.</note> 
                           <hi>Conſecration, not only the Sacrament, but likewiſe the real Body and Blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; and are ſenſibly touched and broken by the Prieſt's hands, and chewed with the teeth of the Faithful; not only ſacramentally, but really and in truth.</hi> It cannot be denied, but theſe words need a Commentary to make them ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Tranſubſtantiation; ſeeing the natural ſence of them is, that thoſe very things which are Bread and Wine, are alſo the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; which is the Opinion of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as I already ſhewed in thefore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter. How comes it to paſs, that what was done under <hi>Nicholas,</hi> was not done likewiſe under <hi>Leo,</hi> who preceded him; and wherefore were the Terms of <hi>Leo</hi> more expreſſive and determinative than thoſe of the Pope that came after him? Is it the Cuſtom in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> to recede from, and diminiſh Doctrines? But howſoever, if Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will make advantage of <hi>Cerularius</hi> his Silence, he muſt ſhew us, that <hi>Leo</hi> decided the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation in ſuch Terms, that the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> could not, when he ſaw them, expound them in another ſence. But to ſuppoſe this without proving it, is a mere Illuſion.</p>
                        <p>SO far is Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> from ſhewing us that this formal deciſion was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Cerularius,</hi> that he does not ſo much as undertake to inform us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Decrees of theſe Synods at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Verſeil</hi> (be they what they will) came to the hands of this Patriarch. He contents himſelf with ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That it had been already eighteen years ſince</hi> Berengarius <hi>his Hereſie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 5. pag. 141.</note> 
                           <hi>famous in the World; that</hi> Dedowin <hi>the Biſhop of</hi> Liege, <hi>and</hi> Adelman <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Breſſe <hi>teſtifie, that the report of it o'reſpread all</hi> Germany; <hi>and that there is no likelihood, but the</hi> Latins <hi>at</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>and the</hi> Greeks <hi>in</hi> Italy <hi>were informed of it, and that a Patriarch ſhould be ignorant of ſo famous an occurrence.</hi>

                        <p>FIRST, he has forgot what his Friends obſerved in their Office, that <hi>Sigibert</hi> ſpeaks not of the troubles <hi>Berengarius</hi> his Hereſie raiſed, till 1051. which is to ſay, that his eighteen years muſt be reduced to two, even by his own Friends conſent. And as to what he ſay's of <hi>Deadwin,</hi> 'tis true, his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter produced by <hi>Baronius</hi> under the name of <hi>Durand,</hi> has theſe Words, <hi>That there was a common report throughout all</hi> Germany, <hi>that</hi> Bruno <hi>Biſhop of</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers <hi>and</hi> Berengarius <hi>renewed the Ancient Hereſies, in teaching that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, was not ſo much a Body as a Shadow and a Figure; and that they annulled the Sacrament of Marriage, and that of Baptiſm of Infants.</hi> And this was it according to this good Biſhop, which diſturbed all <hi>Germany.</hi> As to <hi>Adelman</hi> he expreſſes himſelf more to the purpoſe, for he ſay's, <hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port was, that</hi> Berengarius <hi>deviated from the Catholick Faith, touching the Body</hi>

                           <hi>and Blood of our Lord; and to uſe the words of thoſe that accuſed him, they ſaid, he taught the Sacrament was not the real Body and Blood, but a Figure or reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of them.</hi> Does Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> believe, that theſe Reports, when they ſhould come even to <hi>Cerularius</hi> his ears, were capable of making him take the Field in favour of <hi>Berengarius</hi>? On one hand they repreſented his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in Terms very different from the uſual expreſſions of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> which aſſert the Bread to be the real Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and not a Figure, and on the other hand he had things laid to his charge, which were mere Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities and Calumnies. Why will he needs have a Patriarch that was always at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and held little or no communication with the <hi>Latins;</hi> to know better what <hi>Berengarius</hi> did in <hi>France,</hi> than <hi>Dedowin</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Liége;</hi> or <hi>Adelman,</hi> who had been <hi>Berengarius</hi> his School fellow, and who by this long acquaintance might have ſome intereſt in his Affairs? Why muſt it needs be that during theſe pretended eighteen years, <hi>Cerularius</hi> has been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter informed by his Spyes or Inquiſitors, than the Pope by his? For it does not appear that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> concerned themſelves at the matter till 1053. which is as we obſerved the ſame year in which <hi>Cerularius</hi> wrote his Letter. Nay 'tis probable they had not ſo ſoon taken notice of it, had not an Eccleſiaſtick of <hi>Rheims</hi> brought along with him to <hi>Rome</hi> ſome Letters which <hi>Berengarius</hi> wrote to <hi>Lanfranc.</hi> If the Popes remained ſilent eighteen years, notwithſtanding this great diſturbance in the Weſt, I ſee no reaſon why a Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſhould be any more concerned. I could wiſh Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would tell us, why ſince the year 1053. (to which <hi>Baronius</hi> refers the Letters of <hi>Dedowin</hi> and <hi>Adelman) Bennet</hi> the Ninth; <hi>Gregory</hi> the Sixth; <hi>Clement</hi> the Second; <hi>Damaſus</hi> the Second, have taken no notice of ſo conſiderable a matter; and why <hi>Leo</hi> the Ninth concerned not himſelf in it, till the fifth year of his Popedom. All <hi>Italy</hi> was full of French and Dutch, <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> of Italians, and yet no body all this while could think of waking theſe ſleepy Popes; and cautioning them againſt this damnable Hereſie; which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the Faith of the whole Earth. Let him tell us, why the Patriarchs, that preceded <hi>Cerularius,</hi> or <hi>Cerularius</hi> himſelf reproached them not with this ſcandalous neglect: For if on one hand they believed Tranſubſtantiation, as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſuppoſes; and on the other, that there was nothing elſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt talkt of in the Weſt, and being ſo probable, that the Patriarchs of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> were informed of ſo famous an occurrence, how came they to be ſo mute in ſuch an important Affair, and prodigious neglect of the Popes? Of this he muſt give us an account, before he can require a reaſon of us, for <hi>Cerularius</hi> his ſilence. But to ſpeak plainly, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> deviſes matters in his Cloſet, and having clothed them with all the rhetorical colours, wherewith the power of his invention can furniſh him, he delivers them to us as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Rules of humane Actions; without conſidering, that what he offers agrees no better with his own Hypotheſis than ours. But be it as it will, he makes it not appear, that the Acts of the Synods at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Verſeil</hi> came to <hi>Ceru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larius</hi> his hands, that he might make a right Judgment of them; and this is one of his illuſions, for how can he expect we ſhould ſatisfie him touching the Conduct of this Patriarch, if he does not before-hand ſhew us, that <hi>Cerulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> had all neceſſary information, to make a right Judgment concerning <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarius</hi> his Affair.</p>
                        <p>I anſwered the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity; That 'tis poſſible,</hi> Cerularius <note place="margin">Anſwer to the ſecond Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet. part. 3. chap. 8.</note>

                           <hi>charged with that which was not his Doctrine.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to avoid the force of this Anſwer, turns it into ridicule. Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>muſt make the beſt advantage he can of his may-be-ſo's. He thinks he has ſufficiently acquitted himſelf by theſe three may-be ſo's, &amp;c..</hi> I am not troubled at Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi>'s diverting himſelf; but I am not willing the truth ſhould ſuffer preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice thereby. Had he been willing to examine ſeriouſly my Anſwer, he could not but find I meant, that the Argument drawn from <hi>Cerularius</hi> his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, could not be concluſive, till theſe three things are ſhewed us; Firſt, That he knew what paſſed in <hi>France;</hi> Secondly, That he had a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and diſtinct knowledge thereof, than a meer flying report could furniſh him with; And Thirdly, That <hi>Berengarius</hi> his Doctrine was truly repreſented to him. In effect, if either of theſe three things be wanting, the Argument drawn from <hi>Cerularius</hi> his Silence is invalid. There was no great reaſon than for charging my Anſwer with Drollery, and affirming <hi>my Hypotheſiſes to be fantaſtical, and that I uſe too often my priviledge of ſuppoſing.</hi> For thus does he ſhrowd the abſurdity of his Anſwers under two or three lines of piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful raillery. The matter concerns not my Suppoſitions; but thoſe of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> For this Author's Argument is grounded on theſe three Suppoſitions, already mentioned; not one of which he either does, or can prove: 'Tis he then and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> that argue on groundleſs imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Whence have they this priviledge of eſtabliſhing their Arguments on uncertain matters of fact, or what can hinder me from calling their unproved Suppoſitions <hi>meer may-be-ſo's</hi>? I have not uſed this expreſſion, but ſeeing Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> imputes it to me, I ſee no ill conveniency in adopting it; <hi>may be</hi> then <hi>Cerularius</hi> knew nothing of what paſt in <hi>Berengarius</hi> his Affair; may be he had only a general and confuſed account of it; <hi>it may be Berengarius</hi> his Doctrine was miſrepreſented to him. When Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſhall put theſe three <hi>may be's</hi> out of doubt, he ſhall ſee what anſwer we will make him, but till then I ſhall have reaſon to ſay, that his Proof is grounded on chimerical Suppoſitions.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>BUT,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>the Queſtion being once opened, there could be no miſtake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. For every one knew the Catholicks held the real Body of Chriſt, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the</hi> Euchariſt; <hi>and that</hi> Berenger <hi>denied this.</hi> Firſt, the Queſtion was ſo little known, that it came not to the ears of four following Popes, or at leaſt they pretended not to have heard of it. Moreover, granting it to be as publickly known as he pretends it was, yet People might be as well deceived in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as at <hi>Liége;</hi> where <hi>Dedowin</hi> was groſly miſtaken. In the third place, who told him, 'twas then held, that Chriſt's real Body was preſent in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and not rather that the Bread of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> was Chriſt's real Body? This was the Language of <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and his Biſhops ſix years after; why was it not likewiſe that of <hi>Leo</hi> and his Church. 'Tis not likely Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſhould know better the Style of thoſe times, than the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church her ſelf, aſſembled in full Council, in the year 1059. <hi>Every one,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>know.</hi> It ſeems to hear him thus ſpeak, as if this particular had been proclaimed in every corner of the Streets, and was the common matter of Entertainment; all other buſineſs over the whole World being ſuſpended and laid aſide; and only that of <hi>Berengarius</hi> his conteſt attended to. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> falls into the ſame humour, as thoſe that have Quarrels or Law-Suits; for they thinking of nothing elſe both Day and Night; it ſeems to them, that others are concerned in like manner as they. His mind at preſent is ſo taken up with the Thoughts of Tranſubſtantiation, the real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and <hi>Berengarius</hi> his Controverſie; that he imagines both Eaſt and Weſt
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:41961:140"/> were in the ſame manner affected with it then, and that the Ecchoes of it were heard throughout the whole World. But this is a meer fancy. There is in the World almoſt an infinite number of little Worlds (if I may ſo ſay) which divide and multiply themſelves according to the number and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Profeſſions and Intereſts. Every Affair makes a noiſe in its Circle; yet there are ſcarcely any but Hiſtorians, and ſome curious People, that inform themſelves in each particular circumſtance of Affairs, wherein they are not perſonally concerned; and yet they are often deceived in theſe Matters. I confeſs indeed Matters of Religion, are uſually more publickly known than other things; but beſides that they require time for this, it is moreover cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that theſe reports have their bounds in reſpect of places, and that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they ſhall make a great noiſe in one Country, and yet be little or not at all heard of in another. We may preſume this Affair of <hi>Berengarius</hi> was of this number; for after the Letters of <hi>Dedowin</hi> and <hi>Adelman,</hi> there paſſed eighteen years; as we have ſeen, without any mention of it in the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> neither is there, as I know of, any Greek Author that takes notice of it. If, what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſuppoſes touching this great report, which paſſed over from <hi>Italy</hi> to <hi>Greece,</hi> was true, the ſilence of all the Greek Authors would be every whit as aſtoniſhing as that of <hi>Cerularius.</hi> For why ſhould not they mention it, being as much intereſſed as the <hi>Latins</hi> in <hi>Berengarius</hi> his Condemnation; ſuppoſing they believed Tranſubſtantiation? Why did they not complain of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s ſo long bearing with him, or do the ſaid Church ſo much right as to commend it for ſuppreſſing him? <hi>Peter</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch</hi> held at that time a correſpondence with the then Pope, he wrote to him, and deſended the <hi>Latins</hi> againſt the reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as appears by his Letter to <hi>Cerularius;</hi> yet mentions not a word of this Condemnation, altho this offered it ſelf very pertinently to ſhew the care the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> took to preſerve Orthodoxy, and ſtifle Hereſies, ſuppoſing the Eaſtern People believed Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> finding <hi>Berengarius</hi> his Affair would not do his Buſineſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himſelf to another Artifice. <hi>It concerns us not to know,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 5. pag. 143.</note> Cerularius, <hi>and</hi> Leo D'Acrida <hi>could be ignorant of</hi> Berengarius <hi>his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</hi> Yet this was the Author of the <hi>Perpetuitie's</hi> Chief Argument, <hi>But, whether they could be ignorant of the Opinion of the whole Latin Church touching the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>which was then by the Calviniſts own Confeſſion moſt clear, diſtinct, and determinate for the real Preſence.</hi> But let the Matter concern what it will, his Proof will be never the better. But inſtead of ſaying, <hi>for the real Preſence,</hi> he ſhould ſay, <hi>for Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> for our Queſtion touching the <hi>Greeks,</hi> being only on this Point, if Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will make advantage of <hi>Cerularius,</hi> and <hi>Leo d' Acrida</hi>'s ſilence, he muſt eſtabliſh that the <hi>Latins</hi> made it then an Article of their Belief. There is a great deal of ambiguity in theſe Terms <hi>of real Preſence;</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> do, and do not believe it, they believe as we already obſerved, a real Preſence of Virtue, but not areal Preſence of <hi>Subſtance.</hi> And even we our ſelves, who deny the real Preſence Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> means, profeſs to believe another, which we hold not only for real, but a thouſand times more real than that which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> intends. If then he deſigned to explain himſelf clearly and to the purpoſe, he muſt ſay, that the Opinion of the whole Latine Church was plainly and diſtinctly for Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation.</p>
                        <p>BUT 'tis not enough to ſay ſo, it muſt be proved, for endleſs and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Stories will never ſatisfie our Reaſon. He tells us, <hi>that</hi> Cerularius
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:41961:140"/> 
                           <hi>having ſent his Letter, cauſed the Latin Churches at</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>to be ſhut</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 5.</note> 
                           <hi>up, and took away from the Latin Abbots, and other Religious Perſons their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries. That in the following year, Pope</hi> Leo <hi>ſent Cardinal</hi> Humbert, <hi>and the Biſhop of</hi> Blanche Selve, <hi>and the Archbiſhop of</hi> Melphus <hi>in quality of his Legats to</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>with Letters to both the Emperour and Patriarch.</hi> Which is no more than what we know already without Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s telling us.</p>
                        <p>HE adds, <hi>That</hi> Humbert <hi>wrote a refutation of</hi> Cerularius <hi>his Letter by way of Dialogue, and amongſt the reſt, that the Azyme is made by invocation of the Trinity, the real and individual Body of Chriſt.</hi> There are ſo many faults to be reprehended in this Allegation, that a man ſcarce knows where to begin to refute it. Were his Tranſlation as it ſhould be, it would appear theſe words do not ſo clearly aſſert Tranſubſtantiation, as to give <hi>Cerularius</hi> an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to reproach the <hi>Latins</hi> with it. For may we not underſtand that the Bread is made the real and individual Body of Chriſt, in as much as he has not two Bodies, but one, only? in the ſame ſence Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſay's, that <note place="margin">Chryſoſt. Ep. ad Ceſ.</note> although the nature of Bread remains even then when it becomes worthy to be called our Lord's Body, <hi>Yet do we not ſay, that the Son of God has two Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but one.</hi> And in the ſame ſence <hi>Damaſcen</hi> ſay's, alſo, <hi>That when the Bread</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Damaſcen. I. piſt ad Zac. Doar. Humbert cont. Graec. Bibl. Patr. 1. 4 Edit.</note> 
                           <hi>and Wine paſs into the growth of our Lord's Body and Blood, it becomes not two Bodies but one.</hi> Moreover <hi>Humbert</hi> ſay's not what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> makes him ſay, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Bread becomes the <hi>Individual Body,</hi> his words are, <hi>Corpus Singulare,</hi> the <hi>Singular Body,</hi> that is to ſay, the Body which ſingly and only belongs to Jeſus Chriſt, and not to the Father and Holy Spirit; and there is ſo great blindneſs, or rather unfaithfulneſs in this Tranſlation, that I cannot ſuppoſe it to be Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s. He has publiſhed it without doubt from the Collection of ſome of his Friends, and not from <hi>Humbert</hi>'s Text; For how great ſoever his prejudice may be; I do not believe he would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his reputation for ſo ſmall an advantage as might be expected from this falſe Tranſlation. Obſerve here what <hi>Humbert</hi> ſay's, <hi>The Azyme being thus prepared, is made by an hearty Invocation of the Holy Trinity, the real and ſingle Body of Chriſt. Not as the</hi> Theopaſchites <hi>would have it, the Body of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. Which it ſeems you believe likewiſe, ſeeing you ſay the Azyme does not participate of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Leavened Bread does. Leave this wicked Opinion, unleſs you will be condemned with the</hi> Theopaſchites. <hi>In the Commemoration of our Lord's Paſſion, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Impaſſible Trinity has nothing in common except the ſingle Conſecration, wherein all the Perſons co-operate: For the death of the Humanity only of the Son of God is celebrated in this viſible Sacrament, the Apoſtle ſaying, every time ye cat of this Bread, and drink of this Cup, ye ſhew the Lord's death till he comes. Our Lord himſelf in this particular Commemoration, delivering the Bread to his Diſciples, ſaid to em, this is my Body which was given for you. Mine,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>which by the Grace of the Holy Spirit, I who am the Wiſdom of the Father, have built as a Temple in 46 days, in the Womb of the unſpotted Virgin.</hi> It now plainly appears what is the meaning of this <hi>Singulare Corpus Chriſti,</hi> which is to ſay, the Body which the ſecond Perſon only aſſumed, and not the Father, nor Holy Spirit. To make of this the individual Body of Jeſus Chriſt, to conclude from thence Tranſubſtantiation, is ſo groſs and ridiculous a miſtake, that had Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> met with the like in my Writings; in the humour he ſeems to be of, he would have made it the Subject of a whole Chapter. I ſhall only adviſe him to take more care another time; and not labour ſo confidently hereafter upon other Peoples Memories. This firſt Paſſage is attended by another almoſt of the ſame kind. <hi>He ſay's,</hi> ſay's he,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:41961:141"/> 
                           <hi>that the</hi> Latins <hi>honouring the Body of Truth, that is to ſay, the Body of Chriſt, made of an Azyme, and in the Azymes, taſte with their Mouths and Heart how ſweet the Lord is. This,</hi> adds he, <hi>is clear enough, and a man muſt be very dull, not to underſtand this Language. I confeſs I am not quicker of apprehenſion than another, yet I underſtand very well</hi> Humbert'<hi>s Diſcourſe without Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We ſay,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>that the Azyme of the Chriſtians is very different from that of the carnal Jews, who obſerved and purſued the ſhadow of Truth, invited hereunto by the promiſe, and deſire of a Terreſtial Felicity, ſuch as a long Life, Riches, a numerous Off-ſpring, and ſuch like things. But as to us, honouring and retaining the Body of Truth, which is of the Azyme, and in the Azyme we taſte with our mouths and heart, how ſweet the Lord is, deſiring of him no more, but that he may dwell in us, and we in him eternally.</hi> Is not this to deride People, to alledge ſuch a Paſſage as this, whereby to eſtabliſh Tranſubſtantiation, and that ſo clearly too, that <hi>Cerularius</hi> ought to reproach the <hi>Latins</hi> with it? Had Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> minded, he might have comprehended that this <hi>Body of Truth,</hi> is nothing elſe but the Truth it ſelf, which is called the Body in oppoſition to the <hi>Shadow</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that it is of the <hi>Azyme, and in the Azyme,</hi> becauſe the Azyme is the Myſtery of it, that in <hi>partaking of it with our mouths and hearts, we taſte the ſweetneſs of the Lord,</hi> becauſe his Grace thereby is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to us, and that in fine this <hi>Truth,</hi> of which he ſpeaks, is our Spiritual Communion with Chriſt; as he explains it himſelf, in ſaying, <hi>that he dwells in us, and we in him,</hi> in oppoſition <hi>to the Terreſtial Felicity,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> expected in the participation of their Azyme.</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> adds that <hi>Humbert</hi> believed Tranſubſtantiation; but it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us not to know whether he did believe it or not; but whether he did ſufficiently explain it to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> whereby to move <hi>Cerularius</hi> to make it the head of an Accuſation againſt the Roman Church.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>THE Pope's Legats,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>excommunicated the Patriarch, and departed from</hi> Conſtantinople: I agree with him in this; <hi>The Patriarch would have them return to the end they might be torn in pieces by the People.</hi> This may be. <hi>He ſtirred up a Sedition againſt the Emperor that upheld them.</hi> I grant it. <hi>They ſent the Emperor a true Copy of the Excommunication they had read, in which they ſay, that as to the Pillars of the Empire, and its Honourable and Sage Citizens, they were moſt Chriſtian and Orthodox.</hi> All this concludes nothing. <hi>They blame not</hi> Cerularius <hi>in any ſort touching the</hi> Euchariſt; <hi>which ſhews they had not the leaſt thought that</hi> Cerularius <hi>differed from them in his Opinion about this Myſtery.</hi> Why muſt they blame him touching this Point, when both the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> at that time, uſed the ſame Expreſſions? <hi>Cerularius,</hi> ſay's he, afterwards, <hi>giving way to his Paſſion, wrote to the Patriarch of</hi> Antioch <hi>to animate him againſt the</hi> Latins; <hi>and makes no mention of their Belief touching the</hi> Euchariſt. I believe it. But this ſtill concludes nothing, unleſs it be ſhewed that Tranſubſtantiation was then eſtabliſhed in the Romane Church. This is the Point that ought to be proved, without any more words. For all theſe Narrations ſerve only to inform us, in what perplexity Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> finds himſelf to make out his firſt Proof. He carries his Readers backwards and forwards, from Eaſt to Weſt, and from Weſt to Eaſt again: when the Queſtion concerns the Opinion of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> he goes to ſeek it at <hi>Rome,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Latins:</hi> and when touching the Opinion of the <hi>Latins,</hi> he goes to ſeek it at <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> amongſt the <hi>Greeks;</hi> and all this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to nothing at laſt, but mere Deluſion; for it proves nothing. Was ever ſuch Confuſion beheld in the entrance of a Controverſie, and eſpecially conſidering the noiſe there has been about it?</p>
                        <pb n="251" facs="tcp:41961:141"/>
                        <p>BUT it will be perhaps ſaid; How can we deny that Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was eſtabliſhed, and commonly held by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Leo</hi>'s time; that is to ſay, about the middle of the Eleventh Century? I anſwer, we can be no otherwiſe informed, than by the Expreſſions of the Council held under <hi>Nicholas II.</hi> which I already related, and which contain not Tranſubſtantiation. I believe there were then ſeveral particular Perſons that believed it; and took this way whereby to explain how the Bread is made the Body of Chriſt; but howſoever the Roman Church had not yet declared her ſelf otherwiſe than in general Terms; which could not offend either <hi>Cerularius,</hi> or his <hi>Greeks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THIS is then another of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Artifices, to perſwade us as he would do, that he is not, moreover obliged to prove, the <hi>Greeks</hi> believed Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>and that 'tis ſufficient to ſhew, that all the Patriarchal Churches were linkt in Communion with the Roman, when ſhe condemned</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarius; <hi>and were not parted aſunder upon this occaſion;</hi> This, I ſay, is a groſs Deluſion, for not to mention here, that the Rupture was already made before the time of <hi>Berengarius</hi> his firſt Condemnation, or at leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Condemnation could be known in the Patriarchal Churches, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by what I alledged in the beginning of this Chapter, we muſt further obſerve, that of all thoſe Condemnations (which the Authors of the <hi>Office</hi> make to amount to Eight) there is never a one, but the laſt (which was made by <hi>Gregory VII.</hi> in the Year 1079.) which can be ſaid to eſtabliſh expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Tranſubſtantiation; ſo that the Separation of the <hi>Greeks</hi> being made ſince the Year 1053. that is to ſay, Twenty ſix Years before, this Preſumption (which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſay's, is clearly on the ſide of the Roman Church) is void and fantaſtical, and cannot acquit him from giving us that Proof which we require of him.</p>

                           <hi>prove theſe Four Points. 1. That the Roman Church held at that time the Doctrine of the real Preſence and Tranſubſtantiation. 2. That this Doctrine was declared to the</hi> Greeks <hi>in ſuch a manner, that they could not be ignorant of it. 3. That Cardinal</hi> Humbert <hi>poſitively believed the</hi> Greeks <hi>held the Doctrines of the real Preſence and Tranſubſtantiation. 4. That the</hi> Greeks <hi>did in effect believe this Doctrine, and elearly expreſſed the ſame.</hi> But
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:41961:142"/> having thus diſtinguiſhed theſe Four Propoſitions, and aſſured us they are the plain reſult of <hi>Humbert</hi>'s Diſpute with <hi>Nicetas,</hi> his firſt Deluſion conſiſts in leaving them, and expresſly proving neither of 'em. He contents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with alledging to us a Paſſage of <hi>Humbert</hi>'s, wherein there is not the leaſt mention of the Converſions of Subſtances, nor ſo much as one Clauſe, but what is expreſſed in ſuch Terms as may be well underſtood without Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation. Which will plainly appear, if we take the pains to read over again this Paſſage, as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has produced it, in the Sixth Chapter of his Second Book.</p>
                        <p>I confeſs, he endeavours to infer it thence by way of Conſequence, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>that</hi> Humbert, <hi>denying as he does, that the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>is digeſted,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid. pag. 151.</note> 
                           <hi>and breaks the Eccleſiaſtical Faſt, he can therefore acknowledge no other Subſtance, but that of Chriſt's Body.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT, beſides that, this is not clearly to prove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> then believed Tranſubſtantiation, and that her Belief on this Point was declared to the <hi>Greeks</hi> in ſuch a manner, that they could not be ignorant of it, but muſt perceive it to be the Conſequence of <hi>Humbert</hi>'s Terms, ſeeing on one hand we may ſtill doubt whether <hi>Humbert</hi> ſpake his own Sence, or that of the Church which ſent him, and ſo much the more, becauſe Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges this Cardinal was very hot in this Diſpute, and on the other, 'tis very uncertain whether the <hi>Greeks</hi> went ſo far as this Conſequence. Beſides this, I ſay, the Conſequence it ſelf is neither demonſtrative nor unavoidable; for it does not follow from a mans denying the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is digeſted, and breaks ones Faſt, that he acknowledges no other Subſtance than that of the Body of Chriſt. He may believe, the Subſtance of Bread becomes incorruptible as ſoon as 'tis in the Stomach, and that it paſſes immediately without Digeſtion into our Subſtance, according to the Opinion of <hi>Damaſcen, Zonaras,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Eaſtern Churches, as we ſhall ſee hereafter. For in <hi>Humbert</hi>'s ſence, all Food that breaks our Faſt is digeſted, and paſſes into Excrements, as the common nouriſhments do. Whence I conclude that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives us, when he ſay's, this Diſpute does invincibly prove the Roman Church then believed Tranſubſtantiation, and that her Belief was ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made known to the <hi>Greeks;</hi> for neither one nor the other of theſe do hence neceſſarily follow.</p>
                        <p>NEITHER can it be thence concluded ſhe believed the real Preſence, I mean this local and phyſical Preſence of the proper Subſtance of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Body of Jeſus Chriſt, as ſhe does believe it at this day, nor that <hi>Humbert</hi> thought the <hi>Greeks</hi> believed it, and this Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s laſt Conſequence is moreover found defective, altho this is not the Point in queſtion betwixt us. For ſuppoſing the Bread remaining Bread, becomes the Body of Chriſt by way of Augmentation of this Body, being united to the Divinity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving by the Holy Spirit the impreſſion of the inlivening virtue, which is Jeſus Chriſt, according to the Sentiment of the <hi>Greeks, Humbert</hi> might (without being thought ſenceleſs or extravagant) tell <hi>Nicetas</hi> that in teaching the <hi>Eucharist</hi> breaks our faſt, he expoſed the Body of Jeſus Chriſt to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of common Food. For altho on this Hypotheſis, the Bread is not the Body of the Son of God in propriety of Subſtance, yet is it his Body in ſuch a manner, that ſeems to exempt it from the quality of other Food; which is ſufficient to occaſion <hi>Humbert</hi>'s Reproach, and render ineffectual all theſe little Subtilities of Mr. <hi>Arnaud.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="253" facs="tcp:41961:142"/>
                        <p>I replied, in my Anſwer to the Perpetuity, that this Diſpute of <hi>Humbert</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Anſwer to the ſecond Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</note> and <hi>Nicetas</hi> furniſhed us wherewith to ſhew that, the <hi>Greeks</hi> did not believe the Tranſubſtantiation of the <hi>Latins,</hi> foraſmuch as <hi>Nicetas</hi> maintains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that, the <hi>Eucharist</hi> breaks our Faſt; which ſuppoſes it conſerves its firſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of corporeal Aliment, and that, he believed it deſcends into the Stomach like other Food, which moreover ſhews, he held it ſtill for real Bread. I ſtrengthened this Propoſition by the Teſtimony of <hi>Humbert, Algerus,</hi> and <hi>Cellot</hi> the Jeſuit. I added likewiſe that <hi>Durand</hi> Abbot of <hi>Troarn,</hi> tells us, that thoſe heretofore called <hi>Stercoraniſts</hi> were the <hi>Berengarians,</hi> which is to ſay, thoſe held the Bread keeps its firſt nature, and I confirmed my Proof by ſeveral weighty Conſiderations, as that it was not to be imagined men that were Chriſtians would expoſe the proper Subſtance of the Son of God to theſe Accidents of Corporeal Food, that this Opinion would be inconſiſtent with that State of Glory, wherein we all believe it to be, as alſo with that Sacramental State wherein 'tis made to be in the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> finding he could not eſtabliſh his own Proof, applies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the refuting of mine, and immediately making uſe of his Priviledge, he ſingles out what he pleaſes, and leaves the reſt. He takes no notice of <hi>Cellot</hi> the Jeſuit's Teſtimony, for what reaſon he beſt knows. He paſſes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in ſilence what I ſaid touching the State of Glory, wherein the Son of God now is, and ſo likewiſe what I mentioned concerning his Sacramental State. And from the remaining part of my Proof he is pleaſed to make this Argument. <hi>The</hi> Greeks <hi>are</hi> Stercoraniſts <hi>according to</hi> Humbert <hi>and</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerus. <hi>The</hi> Stercoraniſts <hi>are</hi> Berengarians <hi>according to</hi> Durand. <hi>The</hi> Greeks <note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 6. pag. 153.</note> 
                           <hi>then are</hi> Berengarians. But ſeeing my Proof is to be modelled, I crave leave to take it out of his hands, and ſtate it my ſelf. Obſerve here then how I reaſoned. Thoſe that believe the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> breaks our Faſt, and give cauſe to charge them with <hi>Stercoraniſm,</hi> hold the Subſtance of Bread remains. But the <hi>Greeks</hi> believe the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> breaks our Faſt, and yield occaſion to accuſe them of <hi>Stercoraniſm.</hi> They hold then the Subſtance of Bread remains. And thus do I reaſon; but by misfortune Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> can neither deny the <hi>major, minor,</hi> nor Concluſion of this Argument. He was conſtrained therefore to new mould it, and then knew not how to give it a direct Anſwer.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>IT is true,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>that</hi> Humbert <hi>charges</hi> Nicetas <hi>with believing the Body</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                           <hi>of Chriſt was digeſted; but this is only as a Conſequence of what he offered, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the</hi> Euchariſt'<hi>s breaking our Faſt, and not as a Doctrine which he expreſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted.</hi> It is all one to me whether he attributes to him this Opinion, either as a Doctrine or a Conſequence, either of 'em being ſufficient to eſtabliſh the ſolidity of my Proof. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> may diſpute this Point with <hi>Cellot</hi> or <hi>Algerus,</hi> it not lying upon me to prove it. When it ſhould be true this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence were not well drawn from the Principle which <hi>Nicetas</hi> lays down from the part of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and that the <hi>Greeks</hi> might reply thereunto, there would be ſtill enough in the Principle it ſelf, to make my Concluſion juſt and neceſſary. For thoſe that abſolutely and ſincerely believe the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt</hi> breaks our Faſt, cannot but likewiſe believe that it nouriſhes after the manner of Food, which is to ſay, that it diſtributes it ſelf through all the parts of our Body, being added to our Subſtance, and conſequently that 'tis ſtill real Bread. And it will be to no purpoſE to ſay, the <hi>Greeks</hi> might believe, <hi>That the troubleſomeneſs of faſting is effectually eaſed thereby, and that we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>

                           <hi>God.</hi> For there being in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> only the Subſtance and Accidents, thoſe that believe 'tis in Subſtance the proper Body of Chriſt, and yet affirm it nouriſhes, muſt attribute this nouriſhment either to the Body of Chriſt, or to the Accidents. As to the Body of Chriſt, it is abſurd to affirm that a Subſtance which exiſts after the manner of an inviſible and inſenſible Spirit, can nouriſh our Bodies, that is to ſay, augment the Subſtance of them. And as to the Accidents, beſides the abſurdity there is in ſuppoſing Accidents a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone nouriſh us, the <hi>Greeks</hi> know not what belongs to the exiſtence of Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents without a Subject, which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> himſelf grants, when he ſay's, they trouble not themſelves with theſe Phyloſophical Conſequences. To affirm likewiſe, as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does, that the <hi>Greeks, perhaps only aſſerted the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap 6. pag. 155.</note> Euchariſt <hi>broke our Faſt, becauſe they believed the Oblation of the Sacrifice, did not belong to the Fast, and that they were permitted to eat after they had commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated,</hi> is a mere Evaſion, which plainly denotes Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s perplexity. For the <hi>Greeks</hi> accuſe the <hi>Latins,</hi> not for their eating ſo ſoon after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in Lent, for this Accuſation would be falſe and ſlanderous, ſeeing they know the contrary. But he accuſes them in that they break their Faſt, by receiving the <hi>Euchariſt. Whence have you this Cuſtom,</hi> ſay's <hi>Nicetas, to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate</hi>

Were they the Apoſtles? No; For the Apoſtles made a Canon, to this effect, that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Biſhop, Prieſt, Deacon, Reader, or Chanter, that is in health, faſts not, on the Fridays and Saturdays in Lent, he ought to be degraded; Seeing then you celebrate Maſs at nine of the Clock; which is the hour in which the Sacrifice is to be offered, how then keep you the Faſt till three in the Afternoon, breaking it as you do, in the time of the Adminiſtration? You do not at all obſerve it, and therefore you are accurſed.</hi> It is plainly ſeen here the matter concerns the reception of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> and that he means it breaks the Faſt, for he ſay's they break it, <hi>in tempore miniſtrationis Miſſae.</hi> Where then has Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> found this Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſay the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> breaks the Faſt, only becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, the Oblation of the Sacrifice does not belong to the Faſt, and that it was lawful to eat after the participation of the Communion? <hi>This is,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>the conjecture of a very Learned man, who has taken the pains to read over this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</hi> Is Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſo tired with his Work, and his time ſo mightily taken up, that he cannot afford one half hour for the reading this Treatiſe himſelf, for it requires no more? Theſe Anonymous Learned men do often deceive us with their Conjectures, and when a Perſon makes a Book which he deſigns to render famous throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi> in ſending it to all the Courts in Chriſtendom, it is abſolutely requiſite, not to truſt all ſorts of People. He ſay's in his Epiſtle Dedicatory to the Pope, that his Friends have laboured with him. In the Twelfth Book he gives us a Diſſertation of a Religious man of Saint <hi>Genevieve</hi> on <hi>John Scot</hi>'s Caſe, and that of <hi>Bertram.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he tells us, he has deſired ſome Perſons to tranſlate for him, that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of <hi>Herbert</hi>'s, about which we have made ſuch a noiſe, here he gives us the conjecture of an Anonymous. I am afraid ſome indiſcreet Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or other will judge hereupon, that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s whole Book is made up only of incoherent Fragments. As for my part I do not thus judge, but I wiſh Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> had rectified and digeſted himſelf, what others have furniſhed him with, and not been like the Sea in this particular, which receiving into its Womb all the Waters of Rivers, communicates only to them its bryni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

But he only underſtood they taught that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally nouriſh us, in the ſame manner, as other Food, which changes it ſelf into our Subſtance, and 'tis thereupon that he grounded his charge of <hi>Stercoraniſm.</hi> Do Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> and his Anonymouſes, know better now in <hi>Paris</hi> the true meaning of <hi>Nicetas,</hi> than <hi>Humbert</hi> who lived in that time, and was at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> with this Religious, <hi>Leo</hi> the Ninth, having affirmed the <hi>latins</hi> have the ſame Faith as the <hi>Greeks?</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> thereupon takes occaſion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult over me, and tells me, he will be judged by my ſelf, <hi>Whether 'tis likely</hi>

                           <hi>could do.</hi> Which we muſt examine. <hi>Thoſe,</hi> ſay's <hi>Nicetas, who walk in the Light, eat the Bread of Grace, which is the Body of Chriſt; and drink his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate Blood. In the Bread,</hi> ſay's he, moreover, that is to ſay, <hi>in our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Body there are three living things, which give life to thoſe that eat worthily thereof, to wit, the Spirit, the Water and Blood, according to that ſaying, there are three that bear witneſs, and theſe three are in one. He proves the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Blood are in our Saviours Body, by the Water and Blood which guſhed thence in his Crucifixion, and as to the Spirit, obſerve here what he ſay's; The Holy and living Spirit remains in his inlivening Fleſh; and we eat this Fleſh in the Bread, which is changed by his Holy Spirit, and made the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. We live in him by eating his living and deified Fleſh. Could</hi> Nicetas, <hi>adds Mr.</hi> Arnaud, <hi>more plainly ſhew his Opinion touching the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>and more poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively exclude Mr.</hi> Claude'<hi>s vain Conjectures?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>AND this is that which in the Style of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is <hi>preciſe and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi> I anſwer, that by <hi>the Bread of Grace, Nicetas</hi> means the Bread of the New Teſtament, in oppoſition to <hi>the Azyme of the Law,</hi> and that his Sence is, that this Bread is the Myſtical Body of Jeſus Chriſt, which the <hi>Azyme</hi> cannot be, which he proves. 1. Becauſe the Azyme is not Bread till it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the perfection of Leaven. 2. Becauſe the Azyme is a dead thing having no inlivening virtue in it; whereas the leavened Bread has Leaven, which is to it as it were Life and Soul; whence he concludes 'tis proper to become the Myſtery of the Body of Chriſt, ſeeing there is in this Body three living things, the Spirit, the Water, and Blood, the Water and Blood, becauſe they run down from his pierced ſide, and the Spirit, becauſe his Fleſh was ever joyned to his Divinity. Whence he inferrs, 'tis in the Bread; and not in the Azyme we eat this Fleſh, and that the Bread being changed by the Holy Spirit, and made Chriſt's Body, we live in him, by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his living and deified Fleſh. And this is <hi>Nicetas</hi> his reaſoning, which I confeſs is a little odd; but howſoever, 'tis as I relate it, as plainly appears to him that reads his Writings, his drift being only to ſhew, that the Azyme having nothing in it repreſenting the Life, which is in Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:41961:144"/> it cannot therefore be uſed for the Myſtery of his Body. He himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains his own meaning in theſe Terms, <hi>Saint</hi> Peter, ſay's he, <hi>tells us that we are Partakers of a Divine Nature, and not of the Azyme of the Murtherers of God. Now what man indued with Reaſon will call the dead Azyme, or the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened Bread of the Jews, a Divine Nature? and yet you offer it to God in Sacrifice, and eat it as a Figure of the living Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt. How have you Communion with Jeſus Chriſt, who is the living God? eating dead and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened Bread, which appertains to the ſhadow of the Law, and not the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</hi> If we compare what he ſay's touching the Azyme, to what he ſay's afterwards concerning the Leavened Bread, we ſhall find his aim is only to ſhew, that one is not proper to repreſent the living Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and to become the Figure and Repreſentation of it, th'other on the contrary to be moſt proper. 1. Becauſe 'tis Bread, which th'other is not. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis in ſome ſort living, whereas th'other is dead. 3. Becauſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects Grace, and the New Teſtament, whereas the other reſpects the <hi>Jews,</hi> and Shadow of the Law, there is not one word in all this that ſavours Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation. It appears on the contrary, that he takes for one and the ſame thing, <hi>to be a Partaker of the Divine Nature, have Communion with Chriſt in the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>and to eat the Bread as a Figure of the living Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                           <note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 7. pag. 162. &amp; 163.</note> Claude <hi>ſay to this Witneſs, who ſo clearly affirms the</hi> Greeks <hi>were of the ſame Belief as the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>in the Myſtery of the</hi> Euchariſt? I may truly ſay, that <hi>Lanfranc</hi> looking upon <hi>Berengarius</hi> his Affair as a cauſe wherein his own credit was concerned; and reſolving therefore to vanquiſh at any rate, he was interreſſed to ſuppoſe, that all the World was on his ſide, and that therefore his prejudice invalidates his Teſtimony. I may alſo affirm Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi>'s word ſignifies nothing without Proof, altho it may be as well taken as <hi>Lanfranc</hi>'s. I can ſhew that <hi>Lanfranc</hi> does not ſcruple to offer us a Fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Hiſtory (touching what paſſed in <hi>Cyrillus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi>'s time, and Pope <hi>Celeſtin</hi>'s) and to make thereof a good Proof. Whether through Ignorance, or want of Sincerity, I know not, but ſure I am we have little reaſon to truſt that man's Teſtimony, who has ſo grosſly deceived us. <hi>He was,</hi> ſay's Mr. <note place="margin">Ibid. pag. 162.</note> 
                           <hi>Arnaud, an</hi> Italian <hi>by Nation, where there was a great many</hi> Greeks. <hi>Italy</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly would be a very happy Country, if it produced none but faithful Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. Had <hi>Lanfranc</hi> in effect taken care to inform himſelf by the <hi>Greeks</hi> which were there, what was their Belief touching the Subſtantial Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he would have told us ſo himſelf, and not left it to Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s gueſſes. <hi>It appears,</hi> adds he, <hi>by his way of writing, that he was a Perſon worthy of Credit.</hi> It appears by his Writings, that he was a paſſionate man, and extreamly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with vain glory, which are not the beſt marks of Sincerity. But after all this, I can tell Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> he is deceived in <hi>Lanfranc</hi>'s own Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. For <hi>Lanfranc</hi> only ſay's, <hi>that all Chriſtians do glory in receiving in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament the true Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, which he took of the Virgin. That this is the Faith of the</hi> Greeks, Armenians, <hi>and all the reſt of the Chriſtian World.</hi> Which is grounded only on this expreſſion of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which bears that the Bread is our Saviour's real Body; and that it muſt not be ſaid, he has two Bodies, but one alone. Now we have already ſhewed what they mean by this expreſſion, namely, that the Bread becomes our Saviour's Body by way of Addition, as the Food we eat becomes our Body, which is very different from Tranſubſtantiation.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>BUT,</hi> ſay's Mr. <hi>Arnaud, the Silence of</hi> Berengarius <hi>and his Followers ſeems to me alſo very conſiderable.</hi> I anſwer, this is another of his wilful mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes. For firſt how can he aſſure us that <hi>Berengarius</hi> and thoſe of his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, never aſſerted the <hi>Greeks</hi> did not believe the Converſion of Subſtances? We have ſcarcely any of their Writings, we have no more of their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Anſwers, than what their Adverſaries have been pleaſed to give us. It is true that <hi>Lanfranc</hi> ſay's, when they were offered ſeveral Paſſages out of the Holy Scriptures, and Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Works touching the State of the Church, they anſwered the Church had erred, and all its Members periſhed, except themſelves. But it does not hence follow, that they acknowledged the <hi>Greeks</hi> believed Tranſubſtantiation. They might ſay the Church had erred, and was periſhed from the Face of the Earth, meaning the Weſtern Church. They might ſay the ſame of the Eaſtern Church upon the account of other Errours beſides Tranſubſtantiation. And then again, who can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us that <hi>Lanfranc</hi> gives a faithful account of what they ſaid touching this Subject?</p>
                        <p>IN the ſecond place I will grant that <hi>Berengarius,</hi> and his Followers never mentioned the <hi>Greeks</hi> in their Diſputes. Can Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> find it ſtrange, that People who were every where perſecuted, and afflicted, and had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to do to preſerve themſelves, ſhould be ignorant of the Doctrine of the <hi>Greeks? Berengarius,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>was thrice at</hi> Rome, <hi>and had opportunity to</hi>

Thoſe that are not bound to believe him on his own bare word, will ſtill doubt of it: For he is not infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and I my ſelf am one of thoſe that doubt of it, till he proves it. <hi>The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>BERENGARIUS</hi> had the Word of God, which was enough, they need no other Weapons to defend themſelves that have this. But ſuppoſing his curioſity had moved him to inquire after the Sentiments of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> I know not whether he was in a capacity to ſatisfie himſelf. For as far as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, he was a Perſon that gave all he had to the Poor. I no where find he was one of thoſe that had great mens purſes at command. And living as he did in the Eleventh Century, wherein there were no other Books than what were Manuſcripts (the Art of Printing not being then found out) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſuppoſe ſo free a Commerce betwixt <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Angers,</hi> as at preſent; and having moreover neither Conſuls nor Emiſſaries his Friends to help him in that Country, he may be well excuſed if he did not exactly know their Doctrine.</p>
                        <p>BUT in fine, ſuppoſing, <hi>Berengarius</hi> and his Followers, were not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the true Opinion of the Greek Church, where lies the neceſſity, that they ought to make this an Argument whereby to defend themſelves, ſeeing

                        <argument>
                           <p>Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Twenty firſt Illuſion, is, his charging me with maintaining the <hi>Greeks</hi> never knew the <hi>Latins</hi> believed Tranſubſtantiation.

The Twenty fifth, is his producing the Teſtimonies of ſeveral falſe <hi>Greeks</hi> link't to the Intereſts of the Latine Church.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>HAD Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> left out of his Diſpute, touching the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the Illuſions I already obſerved (as it was very reaſonable he ſhould) he would have ſuppreſſed ſeveral whole Chapters, and abridged others, and by this means, we ſhould not have had ſuch juſt cauſe to complain of his prolixity. And we ſhould have had yet leſs, had he been pleaſed to retrench all that he has written to prove, the <hi>Greeks</hi> could not be ignorant of the Doctrine of the <hi>Latins,</hi> in reference to Tranſubſtantiation. This is the moſt reaſonable thing in the World, for his charging me with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to them this ignorance, and the whole Sequel of his Hiſtories, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and Reflections, whereby to ſhew the abſurdity of this Suppoſition, all this I ſay is but a meer Illuſion. I never pretended the <hi>Greeks</hi> knew not what the <hi>Latins</hi> held on this Article; and he that ſhall read with a little more Equity than Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has done, what I wrote in my Anſwer to the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> will find, that I have been ſo far from aſſerting this Propoſition, that I have on the contrary, in ſeveral places, ſuppoſed they knew it. The Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> having told me the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> lived together in ſeveral places, and yet 'twas never known, there was any Diſpute raiſed amongſt them on this Point; I anſwered, <hi>that the</hi> Greeks <hi>content themſelves with their own Belief, without making it a matter of conteſt with Strangers.</hi> Now this Anſwer ſuppoſes, that they are not ignorant of what the <hi>Latins</hi> hold. I likewiſe mentioned upon this account a Paſſage of <hi>Phaebadius,</hi> who tells us, <hi>that an humble Conſcience contents it ſelf with keeping its own Opinion, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes 'tis better to preſerve its own Faith, than to trouble it ſelf with examining the Belief of Strangers,</hi> which alſo ſuppoſes they knew the Opinion of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, but did not trouble themſelves about it. This Author alledging afterwards the Re-union of the two Churches made in the Council of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> I expresſly acknowledged, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſeem, <hi>to have tacitly ſuffered the Tranſubſtantiation of the</hi> Latins, which does ſtill moreover ſuppoſe, they were not ignorant of it, for men are not ignorant of what they tolerate. The ſame Author producing the Anſwer of the <hi>Greeks</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>de Guiſe</hi>'s Queſtions; I ſaid, <hi>that 'twas an Anſwer contrived on purpoſe</hi>
                           <pb n="259" facs="tcp:41961:145"/> 
                           <hi>not to provoke Strangers;</hi> ever ſuppoſing, as 'tis evident, that they well knew the Doctrine of the <hi>Latins.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>WHAT could then induce Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to charge me with a thing I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much as imagined, and the contrary of which appears throughout all the Sequel of my Diſcourſe? The Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> told us, <hi>that</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Perpetuity of the Faith, 3. <hi>part. cap.</hi> 8.</note> Breerwood, <hi>who wrote a Book touching the diverſity of Religions; and exactly denotes all things in which he pretends they differ from the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>yet dared not affirm, the Greek Church differed from the Latine in the Point of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubstantiation. That he neither does pretend it of the</hi> Aſſyrians, <hi>or</hi> Melchites, Neſtorians, Jacobites, Eutychites, Copticks, Egyptians, <hi>nor</hi> Abyſſins, <hi>but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Anſwer to 2. <hi>Treat. 3. part. cap.</hi> 8.</note> Armenians. Theſe are his Words, and this my Anſwer, <hi>As to other Churches, the Author of the Perpetuity alledges only the Silence of</hi> Breerwood, <hi>in a Treatiſe he wrote of Religions, wherein he does not obſerve, that either the</hi> Greeks, Aſſyrians, Melchites, Neſtorians, Jacobites, Eutychites, Copticks, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians, <hi>nor</hi> Abyſſins, <hi>do differ from the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>in the Point of Tranſubſtantiation. But certainly our Author is very bare of Proofs, that he muſt have recourſe to the Silence of a man that tranſiently obſerves the most noted Differences of Religions, contenting himſelf with ſaying, what Points ſuch a People hold, or poſitively reject, without proceeding to things which they do not believe by way of Negation, as not having heard of them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THESE laſt Words, <hi>as not having heard of them,</hi> have it ſeems given occaſion to all this coyl. But firſt, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> may conſider, if he pleaſes, that my Anſwer refers to <hi>other Communions,</hi> which are called Schiſmaticks, and that the <hi>Greeks</hi> are mentioned only accidentally and occaſionally. Which appears from my own Expreſſions, for having ſeperately handled what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the <hi>Greeks,</hi> paſſing to another Subject, I immediately add, <hi>As to what concerns People of other Communions, the Author alledges to us only, &amp;c.</hi> Whence it is evident, that my intention reſpects only thoſe other Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that I name the <hi>Greeks</hi> only, becauſe they are comprehended amongſt the reſt in the Author of the Perpetuitie's Objection; but yet my Anſwer primarily reſpects only the other People. If it be ſaid, that the Objection including the <hi>Greeks</hi> amongſt the reſt, my Anſwer muſt include them alſo; that in effect it is general, and that otherwiſe I ſhould have left the Objection relating to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> without an Anſwer. I reply to this, that my Anſwer cannot be extended beyond the other Schiſmatical Communions, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of my own expreſſions, which reſtrain and determinate it. A man would think People might be ſo juſt, as not to charge Perſons with thoſe things which are contrary to their expreſs Declarations. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> might accuſe me for leaving the Objection drawn from the Silence of <hi>Breerwood,</hi> in relation to the <hi>Greeks</hi> without an Anſwer. He might have brought it again into the Diſpute, if he would, but he could not apply my Words to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> ſeeing I mentioned them in reference to <hi>the other Communions,</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> of whom I came from treating. What I ſaid before, and what I ſaid even there touching the other Communions, ſufficiently ſhewed what might be anſwered in this reſpect to the Objection taken out of <hi>Breer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> it not being neceſſary to make thereof a particular Article, nor to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them amongſt the reſt. I confeſs the ſence of my Anſwer in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral may be extended as far as the <hi>Greeks,</hi> in obſerving the differences of them with other People, but to apply them to even the very leaſt of my Terms, and make the World believe that 'twas of them I ſpake, is that which Juſtice and Equity cannot ſuffer, having poſitively ſaid, as I have done, that I ſpake <hi>of other Communions.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="260" facs="tcp:41961:146"/>
                        <p>BUT ſuppoſing my Anſwer was to be underſtood of the <hi>Greeks</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; could not Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> underſtand, that I ſpake of People in general, and not of particular Perſons, and meant that the Doctrine of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation has made no noiſe amongſt the People; that their Paſtors, never propoſed it to 'em in order to its being received by them, nor declaimed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, to make them reject it; and in a word, that they never made of it an Article of Faith, nor Controverſie. My Sence appears by the bare reading of my Anſwer. <hi>Breerwood,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>has only tranſiently obſerved the common differences of Religions, contenting himſelf with telling us what People imbrace, or what they poſitively reject, without proceeding to the things they do not believe by way of Negation, as not having heard ſpeak of them.</hi> It is clear I diſtinguiſh three ſorts of Points, ſome which theſe People profeſs poſitively to believe, others which they profeſs likewiſe poſitively to reject, and the third which they do not believe, or expreſly reject. 'Tis in this third Rank, I put Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation in reſpect of them. They never heard of it, as a Point they ought to believe, or an Errour they ought poſitively to reject. They meet not with it either amongſt the Articles their Religion teaches, nor amongſt thoſe which it oppoſes, and expreſly condemns. And this is what I call in reſpect of this People, the not believing a thing by way of Negation, as not having heard ſpeak of it. I ought not for this to be charged with an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute denial, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> never heard the <hi>Latins</hi> believed Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for there is a great deal of difference betwixt theſe two things. I ſpeak of People in general, and not of particular Perſons, and I ſpeak moreover of Points which are not found either amongſt the Articles, which are to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, nor amongſt thoſe that are actually to be rejected; and not of thoſe concerning which we may be hiſtorically informed that other People hold them.</p>
                        <p>LET any man judge then of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Character, and with what kind of Perſon I am concerned. Beſides what I come from obſerving, we ſhall immediately ſee how he abuſes what I ſaid, touching the Halcyon days of the Church. He catches at the leaſt expreſſions, and if he can turn any of 'em into a counter ſence, he makes thereof a matter of Triumph. This proceeding ſeems wholly unworthy a Perſon of his Reputation. Had he deſigned to inrich himſelf with the Spoyls of <hi>Allatius</hi> and <hi>Raynaldus,</hi> and to tranſcribe as he has done their Hiſtories, could not he find a juſter occaſion than this to introduce them into his Volum? Or if he could find no better, muſt the love he has to Stories, and the pleaſure he takes in impoſing on us, prevail over his Conſcience, which forbids him to charge me with a falſe meaning, with a Sence (as is apparent) I never had, and which has no relation to the Sequel of my Diſcourſe.</p>
                        <p>AND yet 'tis on no better Grounds than theſe, that he makes me draw Syſtems and build Machines; that he makes general Diviſions of the World, aſſembles Councils, ſends out Ambaſſadours, tranſports Armies, fills <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> with Pilgrims, preaches Croiſado's, and conquers the Holy Land, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> and the Grecian Empire; that he fills the Eaſt with Biſhops, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots, Religious, and Latin Inquiſitors; that he introduces Princes, Kings, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, and Popes, and ſets on foot Negotiations, makes Treaties of Peace, and Re-union between the two Churches; and all this to prove the <hi>Greeks</hi> were not ignorant the <hi>Latins</hi> held Tranſubſtantiation, which is to ſay, to prove a thing I never denied. Who could think that all this coſtly and ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:41961:146"/> Pageantry ſhould be carried about to ſo little purpoſe; and all theſe great Figures be put upon their motion without any neceſſity, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of a thing we never denied? Yet is it true that 'twas only a falſe equivocation that has occaſioned all this preparation and buſtle, an equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which had he but been pleaſed to conſult me about for a fuller meaning of it (ſuppoſing there were need of it) I could have ſaved him all this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Tranſlating <hi>Allatius</hi> and <hi>Raynaldus,</hi> and ſeveral other Paſſages from the <hi>Greek</hi> of <hi>Pachimerus</hi> and <hi>Anne Comnenus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I would have told him I never intended to deny, but 'tis poſſible the <hi>Greeks</hi> knew what was the Opinion of the <hi>Latins</hi> concerning the Subſtantial Converſion. But withal, that ſince the Eleventh Century to this preſent, this Nation has been ſo prodigiouſly ignorant and careleſs in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and ſo perplexed with their Temporal Affairs, that 'twould be no Paradox to affirm the greateſt part amongſt them knew little of what the <hi>Latins</hi> believe in this particular, ſeeing 'tis certain they ſcarcely know what they believe themſelves. That which I aſſerted in the beginning of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie touching their ignorance, confirms what I ſay. But obſerve here moreover what <hi>Thomas à Jeſu</hi> has written. <hi>The</hi> Greeks, ſay's he, <hi>ſince their</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Thomas à Jeſu de proc. Salv. omn. gent. lib. 6. cap. 5.</note> 
                           <hi>Separation from the Catholick Church, are faln into a moſt deſperate ignorance, which will more plainly appear, if we caſt our eyes on the Ages which preceded the Separation, wherein</hi> Greece <hi>was the Mother of all Arts and Sciences.</hi> He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards relates a Paſſage taken out of <hi>Bozius,</hi> in theſe Words. <hi>Since the Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Century, when the Greek Church began to ſeparate from us, there has ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any Perſon been found amongſt them, excelling in any Science: 'Tis certain</hi> Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory <hi>relates, that in the Emperour</hi> Andronicus <hi>his time (which is about 250 years ſince) there was not a Perſon in all</hi> Greece <hi>that was able to diſpute with our People about Religion; and now there is not one that can be truly ſaid to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently learned. If any amongst them deſire to learn any thing, they muſt leave</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>and come to the Colledge at</hi> Rome, <hi>which</hi> Gregory <hi>the Thirteenth built for the</hi> Greeks. <hi>All the Biſhops amongſt them are taken out of the Order of Monks, who have a Law amongſt them to this effect, that all thoſe that ſtudy Philoſophy ſhall be excommunicated, as testifies</hi> Belon <hi>in the firſt Book of his Obſervations. Now there is nothing more uſeful to men for the finding of the Truth than ſolid Philoſophy. And therefore, the Devil to keep the</hi> Greeks <hi>in this ignorance, has ſo ordered it, that the Biſhops are ſtill elected from amongſt the Monks, and that moreover the Monks ſhould lay this neceſſity upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of being ignorant.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>'TIS likely Perſons in theſe Circumſtances do not trouble themſelves with Inquiries into the Opinions of the <hi>Latins</hi> touching the Myſtery of the <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> and in effect amongſt all thoſe that have written ſince the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Century to this preſent, (excepting the Latinizing <hi>Greeks)</hi> there will be found very few that mention the Belief of the Roman Church, touching the Converſion of Subſtances, which ſhews that they are not well inſtructed in it.</p>
                        <p>YET do not I believe this ignorance has been ſo Univerſal, but that there have been ſome from time to time, who ſufficiently underſtood the Opinion of the <hi>Latins,</hi> and eſpecially thoſe that have had moſt Commerce with them; as for inſtance, ſuch as negotiated the Re-unions, thoſe that conferred with the Emiſſaries, and were Aſſeſſors at the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> and ſuch as were forced to live under the Juriſdiction of Latine Biſhops. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>
                           <pb n="262" facs="tcp:41961:147"/> needed not trouble himſelf with proving this, for 'tis a thing we grant him.</p>
                        <p>SO that here are already ſeveral of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Illſions, and yet we are not at the end of all thoſe he has impoſed on us, touching this ſingle Article of the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>WE may moreover reckon into this number the perpetual Quotation of this Form of a Re-union, which was ſo often offered to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and which the <hi>Greeks</hi> have ſometimes received when they were at accord with the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Church. He tells us, <hi>that the Emperour</hi> Michael Paleologus <hi>his Deputies</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 3. cap. 3. pag 275.</note> 
                           <hi>being arrived at the Council of</hi> Lyons, <hi>preſented the Emperours Letters to the Pope, containing in expreſs Terms the Confeſſion of Faith, which was ſent them by</hi> Clement <hi>the Fourth, and</hi> Gregory <hi>the Tenth, wherein Tranſubſtantiation is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presſly inſerted in theſe Terms. Sacramentum Euchariſtae ex Azymo conficit Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana Eccleſia, tenens &amp; docens quod in ipſo Sacramento, Panis verè tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatur in Corpus, &amp; Vinum in Sanguinem Domini Jeſu Chriſti.</hi> He adds, <hi>that this Profeſſion of Faith was ſworn to on the Emperour's part by</hi> George Acro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politus, <hi>and that the Legate of the Council of the</hi> Greeks <hi>preſented likewiſe a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Pope, as from the Metropolitain of</hi> Epheſus, <hi>and thirty Greek Biſhops, and that he ſwore in their name, after the ſame manner the Ambaſſador had done to imbrace intirely the forementioned Confeſſion of Faith, wherein Tranſubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was expreſſed. He tells us moreover, that in the Confeſſion of Eaith, which</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid. pag 277.</note> John Veccus <hi>inſerted in his Letters aſwell in his own Name, as in the Name of the Greek Biſhops, that Tranſubſtantiation was expresſly contained in it, altho occaſionally upon account of the Azymes; credentes &amp; nos ipſum Azymum panem in ipſo Sacro Officio Euchariſtae verè tranſubſtantiari in Corpus Domini noſtri Jeſu Chriſti, &amp; Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num in Sanguinem ejus per Sanctiſſimi Spiritus Virtutem &amp; Operationem. That they likewiſe do believe the unleavened Bread is tranſubſtantiated into the Body of Chriſt.</hi> He afterwards obſerves, <hi>this Confeſſion of the Greek Biſhops was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the ſame Terms, as that which was ſent thence by</hi> Clement <hi>the Fourth, and</hi> Gregory <hi>the Tenth; but that this difference has no after effect in reſpect of the Article of the Azymes, and that of Tranſubſtantiation, but that 'tis expreſſed more plainly than in the Confeſſion of Faith compiled by</hi> Clement.</p>
                        <p>SO that if we will believe Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> we have here Tranſubſtantiation formally received and acknowledged by the Greek Church. But all this is but a meer Deluſion. This Confeſſion of Faith in the Latin of <hi>Raynoldus,</hi> from whom Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has borrowed whatſoever he has alledged concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, has indeed theſe Words, <hi>Panis verè Tranſubstantiatur in Corpus, &amp; Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num in Sanguinem,</hi> but as I alreay obſerved, in the Greek which <hi>Allatius</hi> cites <note place="margin">Allat. de Perp. Concil. lib. 2. cap. 17.</note> touching the Re-union of the Emperour <hi>John Paleologus,</hi> there are theſe Words, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>The Bread is really changed into the Body, and the Wine into the Blood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Changed, is not tranſubſtantiated.</hi> I have already ſhown there is a great deal of difference between theſe two Terms. The <hi>Greeks</hi> hold that the Bread is changed into <hi>the Body,</hi> which is not the Point in queſtion; but whether they believe 'tis tranſubſtantiated. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> was not ignorant of the difference between the Latine and Greek Copy of this Confeſſion of Faith, for he has taken notice of it himſelf elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where upon the Subject of the Re-union of the Emperour <hi>John Paleologus,</hi> and has no better defence for it, than ſaying, that the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the <hi>Tranſubſtantiatur</hi> of the <hi>Latins</hi> are Synonimous Terms. Why did he not mention this difference in this place, and wherefore has he
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:41961:147"/> grounded his Proof on the Latin Expreſſions? <hi>The Doctrine of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>is expresſly inſerted in this Confeſſion of Faith. I will ſhew Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>Tranſubſtantiation ſolemnly approved by the Greek Church in the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 3. pag. 273. cap. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>ſame manner as men approve things they ever believed, and of which they have not the leaſt doubt.</hi> And a little after. <hi>And thus I obliged my ſelf to ſhew him the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation ſigned and ſworn to by the</hi> Greeks. And this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he does ſhew us, if we only conſider the Latin Text; but if we conſult the Greek, we ſhall find quite another thing, than what he pretends. We ſhall find indeed the <hi>Latins</hi> do believe Tranſubſtantiation, and endeavour to inſinuate it amongſt the <hi>Greeks;</hi> but we ſhall likewiſe find that the <hi>Greeks</hi> depart not from their general expreſſions. For to tell us that <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, and <hi>tranſubſtantiatur</hi> are Synonymous Terms, is what I deny, and have refuted already, and ſhall again refute in the following Diſcourſe. This whole Proof which Mr <hi>Arnaud</hi> has been ſo earneſt upon, reduces it ſelf to a thing which we do not deny him, which is, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> hold the Bread is really <hi>changed</hi> into the Body, and the Wine into the Blood. This Confeſſion of Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us of no new thing, but that which I already acknowledged is to be found amongſt the Greek Authors. Why then muſt this be made a matter of Triumph? It remains ſtill to inquire whether they underſtand it of a change of Subſtance, which is our only Queſtion. Moreover Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> muſt not think to draw advantage from <hi>John Veccus</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi>'s Letter in that the Confeſſion of Faith contained therein is not expreſſed in the ſame Terms, as that ſent by <hi>Clement</hi> and <hi>Gregory,</hi> which was ſigned and ſworn to by the Emperours Ambaſſadour, and by the <hi>Greeks</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat in the Council at <hi>Lyons,</hi> for it appears by reading this Letter, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it with the Formulary of <hi>Clement</hi> and <hi>Gregory,</hi> that in reſpect of the Articles of Pennance, Purgatory, and the Sacraments, 'tis the ſame thing, and the ſame expreſſions, excepting ſome ſlight alterations which were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily made, either to make the Greek Church ſpeak in its own name, or to reſerve as they do the Cuſtom of Confirmation by the Prieſts, or elſe moreover to apply to their leavened Bread, what is not ſaid in the other, but only of the <hi>Azyme.</hi> But as to eſſential Terms, and thoſe that reſpect the Doctrinal Part, they are abſolutely the ſame, and we muſt make the ſame Judgment of them.</p>
                        <p>WE may likewiſe juſtly rank amongſt the number of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions the Teſtimonies of ſeveral latinizing <hi>Greeks,</hi> who left their Religion to embrace the Roman. He cites Paſſages out of <hi>Emanuel Calecas,</hi> concerning <note place="margin">Lib. 3. cap. 9.</note> whom he ſay's himſelf, <hi>That he was of the Order of Fryar Preachers, and wrote four Books againſt the Errour of the</hi> Greeks <hi>touching the Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> He quotes Cardinal <hi>Beſſarion,</hi> and one <hi>Gregory,</hi> who both of 'em wrote againſt <hi>Marc</hi> of <hi>Epheſus</hi> in favour of the <hi>Latins</hi> to defend what paſſed in the Council of <hi>Florence.</hi> He alledges ſeveral Paſſages out of <hi>John Pluſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denus, Gennadius, Scholarius,</hi> and a certain Religious man named <hi>Hilarion,</hi> all zealous Defenders of the ſame Council, all of 'em openly engaged in the Defence and Propogation of the Roman Doctrines. Every man ſees that ſuch kind of Perſons as theſe are no more fit to decide our Queſtion, than <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> would be, or the <hi>Trent</hi> Fathers, and that 'tis not fair to bring in ſuch Perſons for Witneſſes in this Controverſie.</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will ſay without doubt he has alledged them only, becauſe they reproached not the <hi>Greeks</hi> with their not believing Tranſubſtantiation. But if he propoſed to himſelf no other advantage, it was not neceſſary for
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:41961:148"/> this to cite their Paſſages at length, as he has done, nor mark in great Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters the places wherein they aſſert the change of Subſtance, to dazle the Reader's Eyes. It were ſufficient to rank theſe Authors in general amongſt the <hi>Latins,</hi> and reduce the advantage he would draw from their Silence to this negative Argument, which we will examine in the ſequel of this Diſcourſe; which conſiſts in that the <hi>Latins</hi> never accuſed the <hi>Greeks</hi> for their not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the ſubſtantial Converſion. But howſoever it were a juſt thing to lay aſide all theſe Paſſages, as abſolutely fruitleſs and impertinent, and if there be any reflexion to be made on their Silence, it ſhall be taken notice of in its proper place.</p>
                        <p>NEITHER is it leſs juſt to retrench from this Diſpute all doubtful Authors, which is to ſay, ſuch concerning whom we have no aſſurance, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Works attributed to them are theirs, nor indeed whether there were ever any ſuch Authors in the World. I put immediately in this Rank <hi>Samo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> the pretended Biſhop of <hi>Gaza.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> beſtirs himſelf to prove con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Conjecture, that in the Thirteenth Century, which is to ſay, in the time wherein this Archbiſhop of <hi>Gaza</hi> is reckoned to have lived, there were Greek Biſhops in <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> But he does not undertake to ſhew that <hi>Samonas</hi> was of this number, nor that any Perſon ever mentioned him. <hi>There are,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>five hundred Treatiſes of the Fathers, which muſt be rejected, if it were ſufficient to reſpect them as Apochryphal, that they were not cited by others.</hi> His five hundred Treatiſes I grant; but there are not five hundred Fathers of whom no body ever made mention, and which are not named by others. When a name of an Author is unknown to Authors that lived in the ſame Age, and thoſe that follow, this is certainly a ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to make his Book ſuſpected. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> then needed not find it ſtrange, if we place his <hi>Samonas</hi> in this order, till ſuch time as he has more clearly proved his Authority. Suppoſing Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi> was miſtaken in his Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and that there were indeed Greek Biſhops in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> when the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens</hi> poſſeſſed it, this does not conclude that <hi>Samonas</hi> was of this number, nor that his Diſpute againſt <hi>Achmet</hi> was real. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Cuſtom is, that when he finds any trivial matter, altho of never ſo little importance to our Controverſie, to ſtick at it, and uſe his utmoſt skill thereon, to the end, that under the favour of theſe vain Triumphs, he may conceal his weakneſs in Matters of greater moment. Which is what he has done in this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; for ſeeing he could not give any colour to the Teſtimony of this <hi>Samo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> he therefore falls upon Criticiſing; and heats himſelf to ſhew there were in the Thirteenth Century Greek Biſhops in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> under the Empire of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and by this pretence would obtrude on us this Paſſage of <hi>Samonas.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>WE may likewiſe reckon amongſt this Rank of ſuſpected Authors, One <hi>Agapius,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſay's was a Monk of Mount <hi>Athos,</hi> from whom <note place="margin">Lib. 4. cap. 8.</note> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has taken ſome Paſſages. I believe his Collections are true, and that he has faithfully tranſlated them. But what aſſurance have we this was not a counterfeit Author? Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> tells us, <hi>that he lately met with this Book written in Vulgar Greek.</hi> This accidental meeting does already diſguſt me, as if 'twere meer chance that brought him acquainted with this Author. And yet we know well enough how careful thoſe of the Roman Church are, to gather up theſe kind of pieces that are favourable to them; and which may ſerve them as well againſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> as Proteſtants, eſpecially ſuch as this, which expresſly denotes Chriſt's Subſtance under the Accidents and Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:41961:148"/> of Bread and Wine. They could find nothing ſo emphatical in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Author; how then comes it to paſs they neglected this <hi>Agapius,</hi> and that in ſuch a manner, that, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> who has his Correſpondents every where, in <hi>Italy, Greece, Sweedland, Moſcovia,</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> yet ſhould light of this Book on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Chance? He tells us this Book, <hi>was perhaps wrote during the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> Cyrillus <hi>was Patriarch, for</hi> Cyrillus <hi>dyed but in the Year 1638, and this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious</hi>'s <hi>Book was Printed at</hi> Venice <hi>till</hi> 1641. If this be all that can be ſaid in this Matter, every one will judge this is not ſufficient to give Credit to a Book. The Printing Preſſes at <hi>Venice</hi> are no more free from Fraud and Fiction, than thoſe of other Cities.

                           <hi>CYRILLUS</hi> his Confeſſion, offended the Latins ſufficiently enough to Oblige them to Oppoſe againſt him a Teſtimony ſo Expreſs and Authentick as this is. Being an Author, a Religious of Mount <hi>Athos,</hi> of this Mount which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr. <hi>Arnaud is the Seminary of Religious for the whole Eaſt,</hi> and whoſe Faith he ſays, <hi>is that of all the Greek Churches,</hi> how then has it hapned they have ſo much ſlighted him, as not to produce him againſt <hi>Cyrillus: Caryophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> wrote a Treatiſe on purpoſe to Refute this Patriarchs Confeſſion; but he <note place="margin">Apud Habert in Archierat.</note> makes no mention therein of <hi>Agapius. Leo Allatius</hi> has outragiouſly uſed the ſame Patriarch in his Book, <hi>de Perpetua Conſenſione,</hi> and has not fail'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe at length the Councils of <hi>Cyrillus de Berrhaea,</hi> and <hi>Parthenius;</hi> but he mentions not a word of <hi>Agapius.</hi> The aforeſaid <hi>Allatius</hi> wrote a Book againſt Dr. <hi>Creygton,</hi> wherein he indeavours to prove the Greeks believe Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation. He has made a Collection of whatſoever favours his Cauſe out of all Authors, whether Prints or Manuſcripts. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> knows it very well, ſeeing 'tis from thence he has taken his moſt ſpecious Arguments; but he tells us not a Word of <hi>Agapius,</hi> which makes me juſtly Suſpect, that 'tis the Work of ſome Impoſture: But be it as it will, 'tis ſilly to Triumph with it, till 'tis proved Authentick.</p>
                        <p>IN fine, to clear the Diſpute of all Impertinencies, and Illuſions with which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has peſtered it, we muſt retrench the Teſtimonies of the falſe Greeks, that is to ſay of thoſe, who having bin brought up in Latin Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, (and being in their Hearts Romaniſts) yet Live in the Communion of the Greek Schiſmatical Church, and even ſometimes Poſſeſs the higheſt Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. <hi>Gerganus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arta</hi> in the Epiſtle before his Catechiſm complains <note place="margin">In Refuta. Caryophr.</note> very much againſt theſe ſort of People. He ſays they are ſecret Enemies, outwardly ſeem to be Greeks, but are Latins in their Hearts, and <hi>Caryophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> that relates this Complaint of <hi>Gerganus,</hi> agrees in this Particular. We have already ſeen by Report of the Jeſuits themſelves, that one of the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Employs of the Miſſionaries in the Eaſt, is to gain privately the Biſhops and Prieſts, to make uſe of them upon Occaſion, or inſenſibly to inſinuate the Romiſh Faith into the Minds of the Greek Youth, under Pretence of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them Languages and Philoſophy, that by this means they may fill by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees the Eccleſiaſtical Charges with their Creatures. We have already ſeen even by the Teſtimony of <hi>Allatius</hi> and <hi>Thomas a Jeſu,</hi> that this is the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage received from the Seminary at <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein Greek Children are brought up in the Opinions and Maxims of the Roman Church, and from whence they are ſent into their own Countries, to receive Orders from Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Biſhops, to the end they may be promoted to Biſhopricks by the Schiſmatical Patriarchs, and carry on the Latin Intereſt under this falſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:41961:149"/> I do not pretend to decide here the Queſtion whether this way of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding be juſtifiable or not, this being not my Buſineſs: Let every Man judg thereof as he pleaſes. But I Affirm, 'tis not poſſible for People to be more diſingenuouſly dealt with, than we are by Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> in making uſe of the Teſtimony of theſe Perſons, whereby to decide the Queſtion between us. If this be his way of <hi>Confounding Miniſters,</hi> and <hi>Triumphing at their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat,</hi> his Victories indeed will be eaſy, but his Triumph neither Honourable nor Juſt: Is it not a disingenuous Artifice thus to make uſe (as he hath done) of the Myſtery of the Miſſions and Seminaries to blind the World, imagining his indirect Dealing will ſcape being taken Notice of.</p>
                        <p>AND thus does Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> gloriouſly retayl out to us the Teſtimony of <hi>Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius Ligaridius</hi> together with the Letters of Mr. <hi>de Pompone</hi> his Nephew. He firſt produces ſome Collections out of him, Tranſlated into our Language, and in fine has Tranſlated his Treatiſe into Latin, and inſerted it in his <hi>12th.</hi> Book. Would we know who this <hi>Payſius Ligaridius</hi> is, obſerve what Mr. <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone</hi> has writ of him in his Letter. <hi>He is a Greek,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>by Nation, and a Religious of the Order of St.</hi> Baſil: <hi>He was ſometime a Student at</hi> Rome <hi>and</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doua, <hi>and being returned from thence to</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>was made Archbiſhop of</hi> Gaza <hi>in Paleſtine.</hi> Mr. <hi>Pompone</hi> ſeems to make this Acknowledgment with ſome kind of Conſtraint. <hi>I the rather tell you,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>whatſoever I know of this Archbiſhop, becauſe I do not doubt, but ſome Calviniſts here, have given notice of this Treatiſe to Mr.</hi> Claude, <hi>and informed him he ought to be Suſpected, ſeeing he was Educated at</hi> Rome, <hi>and went out Doctor at</hi> Padoua, <hi>ſo that he may think his Teſtimony ought to be rejected, being brought up in our Religion.</hi> Should we not have known then of Mr. <hi>Pompone,</hi> what kind of Man this Archbiſhop was, were it not for that he feared ſome Calviniſts at <hi>Stockholm</hi> would give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of him to <hi>Claude</hi> the Miniſter? Alas, we are not beholding to him for his Account, for we can be informed elſewhere, by a Latiniz'd Greek at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> who goes under the Name of <hi>Signor Gradenigo;</hi> obſerve what he late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wrote concerning him. Payſius Ligaridius <hi>ſtudied at</hi> Rome, <hi>and when he left that City, was a Zealous Defendor of the Latins, but I heard ſince he has publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abjured the Romiſh Religion, when made Metropolitain of</hi> Gaza.</p>
                        <p>TO give the World a more particular Character of this Perſon, and ſuch as are like him, it will not be amiſs to relate at large this Abjuration menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by <hi>Signor Gradenigo.</hi> Obſerve here then what Dr. <hi>Bazire</hi> an Engliſh Divine, (whoſe Teſtimony I have already Cited) wrote to me, who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when <hi>Payſius</hi> was made Archbiſhop of <hi>Gaza. In the Year</hi> 1646, ſay's he, <hi>during the Troubles in</hi> England, <hi>King</hi> Charles <hi>the firſt of Bleſſed Memory, ſent me over from</hi> England <hi>to</hi> France, <hi>to his Son then Prince of</hi> Wales, <hi>my now gracious Sovereign</hi> Charles <hi>the Second, whom God grant long to Reign. After an abode of two Years in</hi> France, <hi>I reſolved to make a long Voyage, and to viſit all</hi> Syria, Meſopotamia, <hi>and</hi> Paleſtine, <hi>which I did in five Years time.

                           <hi>at the Ceremony. The Patriarch ſat upon his Throne, which was hung with rich Turky Carpets, and under him ſat the Metropolitains, and a little lower the Biſhops, Archimandrites,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Whilſt the Office was Celebrating,</hi> Ligaridius <hi>rehearſed a Confeſſion of Faith, a Copy of which he afterwards gave me: Before his Conſecration, he twice or thrice, trampled under his Feet a Picture which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented a City ſcituated on ſeven Hills, with a two headed Eagle, ſoaring over it: The Latins there preſent were extreamly offended thereat, for they knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough this City repreſented</hi> Rome. <hi>After the Conſecration was ended, I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew into a publick Houſe of Entertainment in the City, where the Latins uſually reſorted, where being at Dinner, I ſhared my Cake amongſt the Company, giving part of it to the Popes Vicar, the Gray Fryers and Prieſt that dined with us, who kindly accepted it. But when I would have done the like to the Laity there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, they refuſed it with the greateſt Deteſtation, ſaying 'twas the Cake of that Schiſmatick</hi> Ligaridius, <hi>who even now trampled under his Feet the City and Church of</hi> Rome. <hi>After Dinner the Popes Vicar, who was a learned and honeſt Man, began a Diſcourſe with me touching the Invocation of Saints, and eſpecially of the Holy Virgin; and as I was about alledging to him a Paſſage out of St.</hi> Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Ligaridius <hi>came in and interrupted our Diſcourſe. He began immediately to deſire the Company not to be offended at what he had done: his Excuſe was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, for he told us he thought of nothing leſs than the City of</hi> Rome <hi>in this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but by this Ceremony practiſed in the Greek Church, he meant the trampling under his Feet the Vanities of the World repreſented by this City, and the renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; Yet this Excuſe was not well taken by the Vicar, who was a wiſer Man than to be content therewith. When he was gon, he told me that he was a notorious Hypocrite, and received an Annual Penſion from the Pope, which he had paid him for ſeveral Years, but he ſhould have it no longer for the future.</hi> And this is this <hi>Payſius Ligaridius,</hi> of whom I ſhall ſay no more, but leave the Reader to judg of the Validity of ſuch a Mans Teſtimony.</p>
                        <p>ANY Man may likewiſe judg of the Writings of a certain <hi>Moldavian</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, called the Baron of <hi>Spartaris,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> Cites together with Mr. <hi>Pompone</hi> his Nephews Letter. In which amongſt other things there are theſe Expreſſions: <hi>He agrees in general with us in all things, excepting one Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, namely the Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt. He comes every Holyday to my Houſe to Maſs, and excepting the Creed wherein he forgets the Filioque, there is not a better Catholick in the World.</hi> Is not this the exact Character of one of thoſe falſe <hi>Greeks</hi> already mentioned by us, who are <hi>Greeks</hi> with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> with the <hi>Latins?</hi> Who knows not that the <hi>Greeks,</hi> I mean the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled ones, as they are called, differ from the <hi>Latins,</hi> not only in that they omit the <hi>Filioque</hi> in the Creed; but likewiſe in the uſe of Leavened Bread, in the Communion under both kinds, and in abundance of Ceremonies? That thoſe called Schiſmaticks abhor carved Images, and Invoke not the Latin Saints, nor Believe Purgatory, reject the Primacy of the Roman and Biſhop, and will not Communicate with the <hi>Latins,</hi> and ſo greatly abhor their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that when a Latin Prieſt ſays Maſs on one of their Altars, they Waſh and Purify it ſeveral times, as having bin Polluted? Mr. <hi>Pompone</hi> was deceiv'd when the ſuppoſed the nearer his Barons Religion approached to that of the <hi>Latins,</hi> the more his Uncles Cauſe was advantaged, when on the contrary by this Means, the Quality of this Witneſs is diſcovered, and his Teſtimony appears plainly Invalid. An Exceſs of Zeal made Mr. <hi>Pompoue</hi> go too far, but thus it pleaſed God to order it, to the end our Innocency and Simplicity might not be Surprized with theſe kind of Deluſions. As to what remains, I ſhall only here Obſerve the Imprudence of his Witneſs, who aſſures us, <hi>that</hi>

                        <argument>
                           <p>The Teſtimonies of ſome Protestants alledged by Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Belief of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> Anſwered.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IT appears already that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> muſt have greatly abridged his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute touching the <hi>Greeks,</hi> had he deſigned to clear it from all its Illuſions; and had reduced it into a leſſer Volumn ſtill, had he retrenched all the needleſs Matters it contains. I place in this Rank the Teſtimonies of ſome Proteſtants which he alledges, who ſeem to acknowledge, either by a formal Declaration, or by their Silence, that, the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not differ from the <hi>Latins</hi> in the Subject of Tranſubſtantiation. I confeſs he has not made a Proof there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as knowing the Matter would not bear it, yet has wrote an expreſs Chapter about it, and produces them with a great deal of Art and Pomp, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping by this means to make ſome Impreſſion on the Mind of his Readers, and prepoſſeſs them with this Imagination, that I alone amongſt all the Proteſtants deny the <hi>Greeks</hi> believe Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
                        <p>THE firſt he produces is <hi>Cruſius</hi> Profeſſor in the Univerſity of <hi>Tubinga,</hi> who ſays, <hi>that the</hi> Greeks <hi>believe the Bread is changed into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Wine into his Blood;</hi> but this is not Tranſubſtantiation, there being a vaſt Difference betwixt this and that. <hi>Cruſius</hi> relates the Terms which they uſe, and this is not Conteſted, the Queſtion is whether by theſe Terms, they mean a real Converſion of Subſtances: Which is what we deny.</p>
                        <p>HE offers us likewiſe ſomething out of <hi>Grotius</hi> againſt <hi>Rivet,</hi> and ſets again before us the Teſtimony of <hi>Forbeſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Edinburg.</hi> But we all know theſe two Perſons (altho otherwiſe learned enough, eſpecially <hi>Grotius)</hi> ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelves to be carryed away by Prejudices and whimſical Projects, in relation to the Differences between the two Churches, which they pretended to Reconcile and Accomodate, and thereupon wrote ſeveral things which they did not throughly Examine. Moreover <hi>Grotius</hi> in thoſe Paſſages alledged by Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> ſpeaks not of Tranſubſtantiation in particular, and <hi>Forbeſius</hi> only ſays, <hi>that 'twas received by moſt of the</hi> Greeks, <hi>by moſt:</hi> Here's a Reſtriction, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſays that <hi>Forbeſius</hi> does not prove it. But whether he proves it or not, we do not much matter, for 'tis not by ſuch a man, and his Writings that we are willing to regulate our Sentiments. It lyes upon Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> who cites him, to ſee whether the Teſtimony of ſuch a man be ſufficient. He adds, <hi>he alledges him neither as a Catholick nor Proteſtant, but as a learned Man well skilled in all the Religions of</hi> Europe, <hi>and as a great Traveller: that he quotes him as St.</hi> Auguſtin <hi>quoted</hi> Tichonius <hi>to confirm an important Matter of Fact acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by this</hi> Donatiſt, <hi>who was more ſincere than his Fellows.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT how comes he to forget ſo ſoon the Qualification which the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> gave him, in citing him? Forbeſius, ſays he, <hi>one of the moſt learned amongſt the Engliſh Proteſtants.</hi> What account does he think we will make of a Perſon whom he can neither alledg as a Proteſtant nor Catholick, and
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:41961:151"/> yet lived in the midſt of the Proteſtants, he alledges him, ſays he, as a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man, I grant he may be ſo. But was this learned Man a Jew, Turk, or Moor, whilſt Biſhop of <hi>Edinburg?</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> never alledged <hi>Tichonius</hi> as a Perſon of this kind, that was neither Catholick, nor <hi>Donatiſt,</hi> but as a real <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natist,</hi> altho <hi>Tichonius</hi> ſincerely acknowledged a Truth which the reſt denyed, accordingly as we alledg often the Doctors of the Roman Church, which acknowledg thoſe things others deny, altho we do not thence infer they are not of that Religion they Profeſs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>FELAVIUS</hi> adds Mr. Arnaud, <hi>derides the Inſolence of</hi> Hottinger, <hi>who</hi>

                           <hi>pretends to make advantage of</hi> Cyrillus <hi>his Confeſſion, and ſhews it does in no wiſe contain the Faith of the Eaſtern Churches. Felavius</hi> does not ſpeak of <hi>Hottin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>'s Infolence, but on the contrary calls him <hi>Virum doctiſſimum, Clariſſimum Hottingerum.</hi> He grants not indeed with <hi>Hottinger,</hi> that <hi>Cyrillus</hi> his Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <note place="margin">Praefat. ad Chriſtoph. Angel.</note> contains the Doctrine of the Greek Church, and ſhews his Reaſons, but inveighs not againſt <hi>Hottinger</hi> thereupon, nor particularly mentions Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation.</p>
                        <p>OF all thoſe that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> alledges, there are only <hi>Sands,</hi> and <hi>Dannha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi> Profeſſor of <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> who attribute this Doctrine to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Sands</hi> adds a term of Reſtriction, ſaying, <hi>that in the main, they do in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner agree with the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>in the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> &amp;c. But for two Authors, who perhaps wrote this without much Reflection, how many others can we produce, who ſtick not to deny there's any Conformity in this Article between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins?</hi> For not to mention here <hi>Kem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius, Boxornius, Hoſpinian</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> grants to be of this number, we may here name the famous Biſhop <hi>Morton,</hi> the Author of a Book intituled, <hi>Catholick Tradition, or a Treatiſe touching the Belief of the Chriſtians of</hi> Aſia, Europe, <hi>and</hi> Affrica. The Learned <hi>Saddeel</hi> for whom <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the IV. had ſuch great Eſteem and Kindneſs. Mr. <hi>Meſtrezat, Monſieur Ulric</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Zurich,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hottinger</hi> Profeſſor in the ſame City, Mr. <hi>Robert Chreygton</hi> an Engliſh Doctor who publiſhed the Hiſtory of <hi>Syropulus,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others which I mention not, becauſe 'tis not neceſſary to make an exact enumeration of them. It is ſufficient that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> knows I mean the general Opinion of the moſt Learned Proteſtants in this particular.</p>
                        <p>IF ſome amongſt them, as <hi>Chytreus, Breerwood,</hi> and <hi>Hornbeck</hi> for Inſtance, who diſcourſe of the Religion of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> ſay nothing concerning the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Tranſubſtantiation, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> muſt not think to draw Advantage from their Silence. The reaſon of their Silence is, that they ſet not themſelves to the deſcribing any other Points but thoſe that have bin expreſly Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted between the Greek and Latin Church, that is to ſay, ſuch Points as have bin openly and ſolemnly Debated on both ſides, ſuch as the Article of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, that of the Azymes, that of Purgatory, and ſome others. All that then can be gathered from this Silence is, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> never openly quarrelled with the <hi>Latins</hi> about Tranſubſtantiation, nor the <hi>Latins</hi> with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and that both one and the other contented themſelves in keeping their own Sentiments and particular manner of Expreſſions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out condemning one another. But as it does not hence follow, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> received the Doctrine of the <hi>Latins,</hi> ſo we muſt not take the Silence of <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treus, Breerwood,</hi> nor <hi>Hornbeck</hi> for an Acknowledgment, or tacit Confeſſion, that there is no difference in this Point between the two Churches. Which is what I already anſwered to the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> who would have
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:41961:151"/> prevail'd by the Silence of <hi>Breerwood,</hi> in relation to the other Schiſmatical Communions. For I told him, <hi>that this Author does only tranſiently obſerve</hi>

There is certainly no Diſcourſe more reaſonable than that againſt which an Adverſary is forced to betake himſelf to Illuſions and Wranglings about Terms, for this is a ſign he cannot attack it fairly with downright Blows.</p>
                        <p>AS to Mr. <hi>Aubertin,</hi> of whom Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſay's, he has temper'd himſelf, <hi>and that altho he be otherwiſe one of the Confidenteſt Men in the World, in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting</hi>

'Tis true he conjectured that the Error of the Weſtern people has communicated it ſelf to ſeveral of thoſe of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> towards the end of the twelveth Century, there having bin a more free Commerce between them after the Conqueſt of the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> Yet has he ſufficiently ſhew'd, that altho the Expreſſions of the modern <hi>Greeks,</hi> appeared to him Obſcure, Exceſſive, and Different from thoſe of the Ancients, yet did he not believe, they embraced the Tranſubſtantiation of the <hi>Latins,</hi> and 'tis upon this ground, that ſpeaking of <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> he ſay's that he returned to the ancient Faith, and ſpake better of this Myſtery than others. This ſhews us he obſerved there was more Confuſion and Ambiguity in the others, and more Plainneſs and Diſtinctneſs in the Patriarch <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> but not that he believed the Greek Church received the Doctrine of the Subſtantial Converſion, nor that ſhe held the Subſtance of Bread ceaſes, for he expreſly maintains the contrary.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s negative Arguments drawn from the Silence of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> on the Article of Tranſubſtantiation Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>ALTHO the third order of Proofs which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has made uſe of, conſiſts to ſpeak properly, only in one ſingle Argument, yet this Argument takes up as much room as all the reſt of the Diſpute. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has ſo great love for this Proof, that he is never wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with offering it us. He concludes all his Hiſtories with it, he makes it the matter of moſt of his Chapters, and the perpetual Subject of his Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: If he explains to us the Sentiments of <hi>Theophylact, Euthymius, Cabaſilas, Simeon Theſſalonienſis,</hi> he forgets not to obſerve they did not Believe that the <hi>Greeks</hi> had any other Faith than the <hi>Latins,</hi> touching the Euchariſt, ſeeing they made no mention of it: If he relates to us the Conqueſts which the <hi>Latins</hi> made in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> during the twelv'th Century, he fails not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thence, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> and they, not reproaching one another on this Subject, 'tis a Sign they were agreed in it: If he reckons up to us other <hi>Greeks</hi> who wrote againſt the Roman Church, or <hi>Latins</hi> that wrote againſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> 'tis only to draw this Conſequence thence, that there having never bin any Controverſie touching Tranſubſtantiation, 'tis a Sign theſe two Churches were agreed in that point: If he has Occaſion to mention the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the Eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Latins</hi> in the Greek Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, one of the Uſes he makes thereof, is beſure to let's know, that ſeeing there was no publick Diſpute on the Article of the Subſtantial Converſion, they all equally Believed it. 'Tis for this purpoſe he relates the Treaties of Agreement, Formularies of Reunions, and what paſſed in the Council of <hi>Lyons</hi> and <hi>Florence.</hi> In fine, this is his dearly beloved Argument which he Repeats a hundred times over, without any Alteration but that of the Terms, and Circumſtances he repreſents it withal.</p>
                        <p>IT muſt be acknowledged Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has ſome reaſon to pleaſe himſelf in this Proof, and to bring it in again ſo often as he does, for this is the moſt ſpecious and beſt coloured Pretence in the whole Diſpute, altho at bottom, there will be found no Solidity in it. Which I ſhall demonſtrate in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in which I hope to ſhew clearly the Nullity of his Conſequence drawn from the Silence of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> For this effect, I ſhall make uſe of two ſorts of Means, the one ſhall ſhew that there is not only a great deal of Weakneſs, but Falſity in his Argument, the reſt diſcover wherein this Weakneſs and Falſity do conſiſt, the one ſhall be more General and leſs Direct, the others Particular and Direct.</p>
                        <p>I. FIRST it may here ſeem ſtrange that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> who ſo ſtrictly urges the Silence of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> does not remember what the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> anſwered to my Proof drawn from the Silence of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> who upbraided not the Primitive Chriſtians with Tranſubſtantiation, and the Conſequence I drew from the Silence of the Fathers, who mention not a
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:41961:152"/> word of the many Miracles which Tranſubſtantiation Includes in it. <hi>Who knows not,</hi> ſays he, <hi>in general how weak theſe kind of Probabilities are, and that</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Perp.</hi> of the Faith Refut. 1. <hi>part. p.</hi> 121, 122, 123.</note> 
                           <hi>there are abundance of things which might be ſaid by the</hi> Pagans, <hi>or Fathers, which never came to our Knowledg?</hi> And a little farther, <hi>Books contain the leaſt part of Mens Thoughts and Diſcourſes. 'Tis Chance, or ſome particular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident which determines them to conſerve to Poſterity ſome one of their Thoughts, ſuffering abundance of others to be loſt, which were more common to them, and many times more important. Perhaps,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the</hi> Pagans <hi>never diſcourſed of the Euchariſt, and perhaps again they did.</hi> How comes it to paſs that in ſo ſhort a time the negative Argument, which was in my Hands but a weak <hi>Probability,</hi> becomes in thoſe of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> a puiſſant Demonſtration? The things which were ſaid by the <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Latins</hi> during three or four hundred Years, are no more come to our Knowledg, than the Diſcourſes of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,</hi> or thoſe of the Fathers, and the Books which have bin written touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe two Churches the Latin and the Greek, contain no more mens Thoughts than thoſe which were written concerning the <hi>Pagans,</hi> or thoſe the Fathers wrote on the Subject of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                        <p>IT ſeems theſe Gentlemen Conſult only their own Intereſt: When any Authors ſavour them, they are worthy of publick Praiſe, and when they do not, they deſerve to be Contemned, and their Arguments become ſtrong or weak, good or bad, accordingly as they are ſerviceable, or otherwiſe. It is certain if Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s and my Proof be compared together in reſpect of Form, they are equal; for we ſuppoſe the ſame Principles, and draw thence the ſame Conſequences; but if they be compared in reſpect of the matter, the Advantage is wholly on my ſide, for all the Circumſtances ſtrengthen my Argument, whereas they weaken his. The <hi>Pagans</hi> were Learned, they had the Power in their Hands, they needed not diſſemble with the Chriſtians: They knew very well the Doctrines of Chriſtianity. The matter concerned the pulling down of their Altars, and they were intereſſed to conſerve their ancient Religion, to decry theſe Novelties which had introduced themſelves into the World. There can be nothing ſaid like this, concerning the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as will appear in the Sequel of this Chapter: And yet my Argument is not Concluſive in the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi>'s Judgment, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Argument, if we believe himſelf, is undeniably Evident; that is to ſay, theſe Gentlemen beſtow on Arguments, when they are pleaſed to make uſe of them, the Title of good ones, but when the ſame Arguments are urged againſt them then they become bad ones. This partiality proceeds only from prejudice.</p>
                        <p>BUT in the ſecond place, without wandring from the Subject in Hand, I can oppoſe againſt Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s negative Proof, ſeveral other Proofs of the like kind I have already made uſe of in the preceding Book, which conclude with a thouſand times more ſtrength than his, and conſequently deſerve to be preferred before them, according to the Rules of right Reaſon. The <hi>Greeks</hi> in explaining the Myſtery of the Euchariſt, do aſſert neither the Exiſtence of Accidents without a Subject, nor the Concomitancy, or Exiſtence of the Body of Chriſt in the Euchariſt after the manner of Spirits, nor his Exiſtence in ſeveral places. They trouble not themſelves with inquiring how our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are nouriſhed when they receive the Sacrament, nor of what matter the Worms are formed which are bred in the Euchariſt, nor ſeveral other Queſtions. In ſhort they mention not a Word touching any of the natural Conſequences of Tranſubſtantiation, which a man cannot but conſider, and
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:41961:153"/> which common Sence diſcovers without the help of any Philoſophy; as I already ſhewed in the tenth Chapter of the foregoing Book.</p>
                        <p>ALL that I now deſire is, that my negative Proofs be compared with that Proof Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> draws from the <hi>Greeks</hi> not making Tranſubſtantiation a point of Controverſy between them and the <hi>Latins.</hi> The <hi>Greeks,</hi> ſay's he, have bin ſilent on the Tranſubſtantiation of the <hi>Latins,</hi> they neither oppoſed nor condemned it; therefore they believed it as well as the <hi>Latins.</hi> The <hi>Greeks,</hi> ſay I, have for Example bin ſilent on the Exiſtence of the Accidents of Bread ſeparated from their proper Subſtance, they neither handled this Point, nor ſo much as made mention of it, therefore they do not believe it, nor conſequently Tranſubſtantiation. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> muſt acknowledg that my Proof is far more concluſive than his, for 'tis a thouſand times more natural for people that hold the Subſtance of Bread ceaſes, and yet and taſt behold all the Qualities, and Properties thereof to conſider how theſe things ſubſiſt, or at leaſt to ſpeak in ſome ſort of it, than 'tis natural to thoſe that do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Tranſubſtantiation, to reproach them with it, that do believe it. If we weigh all Circumſtances, we ſhall find, the Commerce the Greek Doctors have had either with their own people, or with themſelves, in reflecting on what fell under their Sence, has bin more particular and frequent than that which they have had with the <hi>Latins.</hi> That which they ſaw and believed has bin more diſtinctly known to them, than what the <hi>Latins</hi> taught, or <hi>Gregory</hi> the VII, or <hi>Innocent</hi> the III. determin'd in their Councils. The Intereſt of quieting their own Conſciences and ſatisfying their own Minds, muſt needs be more prevalent with them, than that of quarrelling with the <hi>Latins.</hi> The occaſions of ſatisfying themſelves, and inſtructing their people oftner preſented themſelves, than thoſe of condemning ſtrangers, with whom they dealt only by their Ambaſſadours and Interpreters. The reaſons of their Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, in reſpect of the <hi>Latins,</hi> are eaſilyer found out, than thoſe which would oblige them to be ſilent, in reſpect of themſelves. For what ſignifies the tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us the Glory of God, and Reſpect to his Myſteries were the cauſe of their Silence touching the Exiſtence of the Accidents without a Subject; For this ſame Glory of God, and reſpect to his Myſteries would engage them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the reaſons of their Silence, to the end they may be known to all the Faithful under their Charge, and to exhort them to the ſame Silence. Were I willing to enlarge my Book after Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Example, who has hunted after little Stories whereby to bring over again a hundred times the ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, I ſhould tire my Readers Patience, for I could argue touching all the Occaſions the <hi>Greeks</hi> have had to ſee, and adminiſter the Euchariſt, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and partake of it, the <hi>Eaſters</hi> in which time the people do univerſally Communicate, touching the Sick that deſire it, and received it, the Books wherein they explain'd the Myſtery of it; and in general touching whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may adminiſter them an Occaſion of conſidering the Accidents, and I might as often draw this Concluſion that they do not believe Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeeing they have ſaid nothing concerning this pretended Miracle of the Exiſtence of Accidents ſeparated from their Subject.</p>
                        <p>'TIS the ſame with the other Conſequences of the ſubſtantial Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. A Man needs only his Eye-ſight to aſſure himſelf that if what we receive in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> be really and ſubſtantially the natural Body of Chriſt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Sence of the <hi>Latins,</hi> it is not in the uſual form of a humane Body; whence there immediately ariſes this Conſideration, how it can be without this Form. How it can be in a place after an unlocal manner, neither palba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:41961:153"/> nor diviſible, thus more like a Spirit than a Body, and yet without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Senſe, or Action, and in this more like an inanimate Body than a Spirit. A Man needs but little Senſe to comprehend, that if the Subſtance of Bread ceaſes, there can be nothing found in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to which may be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the effect of the Nouriſhment we receive thence. Neither needs there much Study to find out, that if the Subſtance of the natural Body of Chriſt be preſent in the Sacrament, he is then in ſeveral places at the ſame time, to wit, in Heaven, and on all the Altars whereon are celebrated this divine Myſtery; Yet do they make no mention of theſe things.</p>
                        <p>WE have ſeen that one of their Opinions is, that the Wicked do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt's Body in the Sacrament. Now every Man ſees this Doctrine does not well agree with Tranſubſtantiation, in as much, as that on one Hand, 'tis held the Bread is made the Body of the Son of God in propriety of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and on the other, that the Wicked in receiving it, eat not this Body. Whence it follows according to all Rules of Sence, that they are obliged to endeavour to make theſe two Opinions agree, and remove the contrariety which appears betwixt them. Yet ſo far are they from troubling themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this, that we find not this Contrariety, (whether real or imaginary) ever entred into their Thoughts.</p>
                        <p>NOW let any Man compare the Arguments we draw from their Silence touching all theſe Conſequences, with that of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s; and faithfully tell us, whether ours are not more Concluſive and Evident than his. We have propoſed ſeveral things which the <hi>Greeks</hi> might know without any Study, Reflection, Attention of Mind, Legats, and Interpreters, only by the ſight of their Eyes, and help of common Sence; Affairs which were neither carried on by Intrigues, Negotiations, nor publick Reſpects; and wherein the Silence of the <hi>Greeks</hi> is certain, there being no likelyhood but if they ſpake of 'em, we ſhould be ſoon made to know it, and concerning which, in fine, they could not be ſilent as they are, without doing a notable Prejudice to Religion, and an extraordinary Violence to Nature. Whereas Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> only offers us one thing, which can ſcarcely be known by any but the Learned, and which requires alſo great attention of Mind, and reading; a matter which for the moſt part was in the hands of ſome Deputies, and mannaged by the help of Interpreters, wherein Intrigues and Intereſts, Complacency and Fear, and other humane Paſſions have great ſhare, and touching which we cannot be aſſured whether the Silence of the <hi>Greeks</hi> be truly ſuch as 'tis repreſented to us, ſeeing we have no more of their Writings but what the <hi>Latins</hi> were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give us. A matter in fine, in which the <hi>Greeks</hi> might be ſilent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offering any Violence to themſelves, and without believing they did any Wrong to their Religion. I ſhall ſhow this more largely hereafter, what I now mention'd being only to facilitate the compariſon of my Proofs with that of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s, to the end the Readers may more clearly and exactly judg of them.</p>
                        <p>III. IN the third place, it is neceſſary that my firſt Proofs which I offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the foregoing Book, be remembred, which were taken from that the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not teach the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation in expreſs terms, I mean the ſubſtantial Converſion aſſerted by the <hi>Latins;</hi> that they receive not the Councils which have determined it, that they will not uſe the term of <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, that they explain themſelves only in general Terms, which may be underſtood in another Sence, and which at fartheſt can admit only
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:41961:154"/> of a general Sence; and that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is conſtrain'd to betake himſelf to Conſequences and Arguings to render their Expreſſions favourable. It is likewiſe requiſite that the Reader call to mind the ſolid Grounds on which my Proofs are built, and the Teſtimonies I have produced on this Subject, and on the other Hand, the Illuſions I diſcovered in Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Diſpute, as well in the formulary of the Reunion with which he has made ſuch a noiſe, as the Teſtimonys of <hi>Samonas, Agapius,</hi> the Baron of <hi>Spataris, Payſius Ligari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> the Synod of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and that of ſome Prieſts in the Patriarchate of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch;</hi> for the Truth of my Principle reſults from the Examination of all theſe things, the reſt of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Proofs conſiſting only in Arguings and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. I would likewiſe deſire the Reader to compare his negative Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument with mine, and judg which of the two Conſequences is the better. The <hi>Greeks</hi> (ſay I) when they explain the Myſtery of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> uſe not the Term of Tranſubſtantiation, nor teach the thing which this Term ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, they own not the Councils that have determin'd it; and in the rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them never except this Article, nor ſhew by any thing elſe they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in it. They do not then believe the ſubſtancial Converſion of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſay's on the contrary; the <hi>Greeks</hi> reproach not the <hi>Latins</hi> with Tranſubſtantiation, they make not a Diſpute thereof, they condemn it not as an Errour; they then Believe it. I ſay that my Conſequence is evident, certain, immediate, and neceſſary, whereas Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s has none of theſe Qualities. My Conſequence is evident, for 'tis evident a whole Church that believes the Converſion of the Subſtance of Bread into the Subſtance of the Body of Chriſt, and would have her Children Believe it, muſt needs teach it them in clear and diſtinct Terms, and ſuch as are able to form the <hi>Idea</hi> which ſhe would have them conceive of it; But the Greek Church does not do this; therefore ſhe does not believe it. For it would be prodigiouſly ſtrange that a Church had, concerning the Change which happens in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> a Belief as diſtinct and determinate, as is that of the Converſion of one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance into another, and yet, could not, or would not explain her ſelf in clear and diſtinct Terms, altho ſhe finds them already made to her Hands, in the Language of a Church with whom ſhe agrees in this Point. But this the Greek Church does not do; She does not thus explain her ſelf, She has not then this Belief. My Conſequence is immediate; for the firſt and moſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Obligation, the firſt and moſt immediate Effect which ariſes from the Belief of Tranſubſtantiation in a Church that holds it, is that of teaching it, and explaining how ſhe believes it, that is to ſay diſtinctly, for it cannot be believed otherwiſe than diſtinctly: But the Greek Church does not explain her ſelf diſtinctly; She does not then believe it. I ſay in fine, that 'tis neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary: For there is nothing that can hinder the Greek Church from expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clearly and plainly this Opinion, if ſhe held it: Not the Ignorance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Expreſſions, for beſides that they are eaſily met with, the Roman Church furniſhes her with them, not the Fear of ſcandalizing her People, for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> aſſerts theſe People have held this Doctrine ever ſince Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity was firſt planted amongſt them, not the fear of ſcandalizing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, for the <hi>Turks</hi> amongſt whom the <hi>Greeks</hi> live, ſuffer all ſorts of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the <hi>Latins</hi> who were mixt with them, and who ſcruple not to explain themſelves clearly on this Doctrine, have long ſince taken away this Pretence from the <hi>Greeks;</hi> the fear of offending their Emperors, when they had 'em, could not withold them, for the Greek Emperors as we have already ſeen, have almoſt all of 'em favoured the <hi>Latins.</hi> Much leſs moreover can it be ſaid they were hindred by the Fear of the Roman Church, and its Power, for this was a means on the contrary to obtain her Favour. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:41961:154"/> all this the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not aſſert this Doctrine in clear diſtinct Terms; therefore they hold it not.</p>
                        <p>NOW let a man reflect on the Conſequence Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> draws, and he will find that it has none of theſe Qualities which I come now from obſerving in mine. It is not evident, for what Certainty is there that if a Church does not imbrace a Doctrine, ſhe muſt therefore immediately condemn it, and make thereof a matter of Controverſy? This Propoſition taken in its gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality is not only unevident, but falſe, and contrary to the Principles of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Scripture. Being applyed in particular to Tranſubſtantiation, it has no Evidence, for it muſt be ſuppoſed that a Church which does not believe it, conſiders it in a due manner, whereby to judg that 'tis a damnable Error, and that ſhe wants not Knowledg for the making of this Judgment; and ſuppoſing ſhe wants not Knowledg whereby to make this Judgment, we muſt farther ſuppoſe that ſhe believes her ſelf obliged to paſs this Cenſure, againſt a Church from which ſhe is actually ſeparated. We muſt beſides this, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſhe has Courage enough to do her Duty, and that no humane Reſpect can withold her from it. Now it cannot be ſhow'd that theſe three Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are evident in reſpect of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> whence it appears that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Conſequence is of no certainty; for what Certainty is there in a Conſequence that depends on three Suppoſitions, which are not only very uncertain, but falſe, as will appear upon Examination. Neither is it likewiſe immediate, for 'tis certain there is no medium between believing Tranſubſtantiation, and clearly explaining it, in reſpect of a Church which is at full liberty to ſpeak on it what ſhe thinks: But betwixt not believing it, and making thereof a point of Controverſy with Strangers that do believe it, there's a vaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. In fine, I ſay this Conſequence has no neceſſity, for it might bin hindred by a thouſand things, through want of learned Men able to mannage this Controverſy, by the temporal Intereſts of their Empire, and Church, and fear of provoking the <hi>Latins,</hi> who have bin almoſt continually their Maſters, by the Intrigues of their Emperours, and ſeveral of their Patriarchs and Biſhops; but eſpecially by a Spirit of Superſtition which has occaſioned long ſince the turning of Religion into childiſh Ceremonies, neglecting the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity to apply themſelves to Fopperies.</p>
                        <p>TO Illuſtrate more clearly this Compariſon, which I deſire the Reader to make, between Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s negative Arguments and mine, it will be convenient to make here a general Reflection on the ſtate of our Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy. The Queſtion between us is to know whether the <hi>Greeks</hi> believe Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, or not; Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has undertaken to prove the Affirmative, and I the Negative. Now this being ſo, it is evident I am only obliged to prove my Theſis by negative Arguments. The <hi>Greeks</hi> teach not Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor its neceſſary and natural Conſequences: therefore they do not believe it. This concludes very well according to the nature of the Theſis which I defend, and this Proof is ſufficient to ſatisfie a mans Mind, and decide the Queſtion. But 'tis not the ſame with Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> for he is obliged to prove his Propoſition, not ſo much by the Silence of theſe People, as by their Words, not ſo much by negative Arguments, as by poſitive ones. The <hi>Greeks</hi> ſay's he, believe Tranſubſtantiation; which is what he ought to ſhew by affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Arguments: Were then the Concluſion he draws from the Silence of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> more probable than 'tis, yet could it not perſwade by it ſelf any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Perſon. Our Minds might be perplexed with it, but yet 'twill be ſtill ſaid, we muſt examine what the <hi>Greeks</hi> poſitively teach touching the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,</hi>
                           <pb n="278" facs="tcp:41961:155"/> and ſee how they explain themſelves concerning it, becauſe this is the juſt and only means of deciding the Queſtion. In effect, if it be true the <hi>Greeks</hi> teach Tranſubſtantiation, the negative Arguments drawn from their not making a Controverſy of it with the <hi>Latins,</hi> are ſuperfluous; the matter is decided, and we need go no farther; but if it be true on the contrary that they do not teach it, the negative Arguments are of no Conſequence, we muſt keep to what we find contained in their form of Doctrine. It is then certain there is more ſhow than real ſolidity in this part of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Diſpute, and that 'tis more likely to divert the Fancy, than ſatisfy the Judgment. It may dazle our Eyes by a falſe appearance, but cannot inſtruct us, for it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides nothing, a man ſtill remains in the deſire and neceſſity of knowing what the <hi>Greeks</hi> teach. If he ſatisfies this Deſire, 'tis ſufficient, but if not, his negative Arguments ſignify nothing. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> then might well have ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all thoſe Hiſtories, Accounts of Reunions, and the enumeration of all the Authors that have treated on the Differences between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins.</hi> All which has bin to no purpoſe, ſeeing that when we have beſtowed never ſo much time on the Diſcuſſion of theſe things, we muſt return again to the principal Point, which is to know poſitively what the <hi>Greeks</hi> teach concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> For as I now ſaid, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Propoſition being affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to wit, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> believe Tranſubſtantiation, he muſt clearly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh it by affirmative Proofs; for 'tis on theſe alone, whereon depends the deciſion of the Queſtion, and not on negative Arguments, drawn from what they do not do.</p>
                        <p>AND thus far touching my general means: Come we now to Particulars. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> pretends that if the <hi>Greeks</hi> have not heretofore believed Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, nor yet ſtill believe it, they ought to make it a point of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy with the <hi>Latins.</hi> I anſwer, the <hi>Greeks</hi> contented themſelves with keeping their own Belief concerning the Sacrament, and held to their uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Expreſſions, and have not admitted the Determinations of <hi>Gregory</hi> the VII. or <hi>Innocent</hi> the III. nor the Doctrine of the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> and yet never proceeded to a formal Condemnation of the Sentiment of the <hi>Latins,</hi> nor made it a matter of Diſpute and Controverſy. In a word, they do neither believe, nor oppoſe Tranſubſtantiation: They do not believe it, for it is not to be ſeen in the Doctrine of their Church; in their Confeſſions of Faith, Books of Divinity, Deciſions of their Councils, Liturgies, Catechiſms, nor Sermons; neither do they oppoſe it, for as far as we can find, they never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted this Point with the <hi>Latins,</hi> nor formally debated it in their ancient Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences. I ſay, as far as we can find, for 'tis impoſſible but ſome have Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted on it, altho all Records thereof have bin loſt, or ſuppreſſed, ſeeing none of them ever came to our Knowledg. But be it as it will, at worſt, it only concerns us to know whether my Anſwer is reaſonable, and whether in effect the <hi>Greeks</hi> not believing the Converſion of Subſtances, 'tis poſſible they have not condemned this Opinion in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now I maintain this is not only poſſible, but moſt probable: whence it follows that Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi>'s Argument is neither Concluſive in <hi>genere neceſſario</hi> nor <hi>probabili</hi> (as the Schools ſpeak) when we nearly examine it.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. To ſhew this, I firſt of all produce the Example of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, which condemns not ſeveral Opinions which ſhe knows are held by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons, and even by whole Societies too under her Juriſdiction, and yet does not receive them, nor approve of them. She keeps Silence in their reſpect, for Reaſons beſt known to her ſelf, yet would not have it argued from
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:41961:155"/> her Silence, ſo reſolutely as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does from that of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> The Queſtion whether the Infallibility reſides in the Pope, or Council, has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd hitherto undetermined, ſeveral Perſons ſtill debate it, and we know which ſide the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> favours; yet we cannot poſitively ſay that they have condemned, or oppoſed as an Error, the Opinion of thoſe who prefer the Council above the Pope; and yet, they will be loath men ſhould argue from their Silence. How long has the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſuffered the Sentiment of the <hi>Dominicans</hi> touching the Conception of the Virgin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out oppoſing or condemning it, altho ſhe does not approve of it? This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence drawn by Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is ſo little ſolid, and if I may ſay the Truth, ſo captious, that <hi>Innocent</hi> the X. adviſed us not to abuſe thus the Silence of Perſons; for in his Conſtitutions wherein he condemns the five Propoſitions ſuppoſed to be taken out of <hi>Janſenius</hi> his Writings, he expreſly declares that altho he has only condemned theſe five Propoſitions, yet he would not have any Man think he approves by his Silence the reſt of that Book. If I ſay then that the <hi>Greeks</hi> in diſputing only on ſome Articles, never pretended to approve by their Silence on the reſt of the Religion of the <hi>Latins,</hi> much leſs in particular of the Doctrine of the ſubſtantial Converſion, I aſſert nothing but what may be judged Reaſonable from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s own Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Maxim of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> himſelf.</p>
                        <p>IT will not be amiſs to obſerve two things in theſe Examples I now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced, the one, that the Point before us is concerning what paſſed in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Boſom of the Roman Church, between Perſons that belonged to it, and whom ſhe is obliged to inſtruct and reduce into the right way; and 'thother that ſhe had juſt cauſe to fear, leſt under the Favour of this Toleration, the Error would communicate it ſelf to ſeveral Perſons, and in fine, the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the People be infected with it. Now the firſt of theſe things has no place in reference to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> for the Point before us does not concern an Opinion ſprung up in their Church, but in a forrain and ſeparate one, and over which they pretend no Juriſdiction. As to the ſecond thing, I confeſs, had the <hi>Greeks</hi> reflected, as they ought, on this their Silence, they could not but perceive that the <hi>Latins</hi> (who make advantage of every thing) would not fail to indeavour the bringing in of Tranſubſtantiation into <hi>Greece,</hi> under the benefit of this Silence, and take from thence occaſion to perſwade ſimple People that the two Churches are agreed in this particular. But how mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ſoever this Danger was, it is clear that that wherein the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ventures her ſelf, in ſuffering thoſe Opinions to take root which ſhe tolerates in her own Boſom, is yet more evident; and yet notwithſtanding ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains Silent: Which ſhews the Vanity of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Conſequence. For if the Roman Church can ſuffer Opinions in the very midſt of her, which ſhe does not approve, why cannot the <hi>Greeks</hi> uſe the ſame Forbearance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards an Opinion of the <hi>Latins,</hi> and if we may not conclude from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s not oppoſing a Doctrine, that ſhe holds it, or teaches it, why may we not make the ſame Concluſion in reſpect of the <hi>Greeks?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">II. IN the ſecond place, I inſtance in ſeveral other important Articles, wherein the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not agree with the <hi>Latins,</hi> and yet we do not find they made them a matter of Diſpute any more than Tranſubſtantiation. For Example, the <hi>Greeks</hi> believe the Pains of the Damned, are eaſed by the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the living. They farther believe that ſo great is the efficacy of their Prayers, that they ſometimes deliver theſe Wretches abſolutely from their Torments, and reſcue them from Damnation. <hi>They are,</hi> ſay's <hi>Allatius, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:41961:156"/> found of this Opinion, that the Prayers of good People profit the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Allat. Diſſ 2. de lib. Eccl. Grec.</note> 
                           <hi>and thoſe condemned to eternal Miſery, and that they are eaſed, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wholy delivered by them.</hi> Which he proves by ſeveral Paſſages in their <hi>Triode</hi> (which is one of their eccleſiaſtical Books) and other their moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Authors. The <hi>Latins</hi> are of a contrary Opinion. <hi>It is certain,</hi> ſay's <hi>Bellarmin, that the Prayers of the Church are beneficial neither to the Bleſſed</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Bellarm de purg. lib. 2. C. 18.</note> 
                           <hi>in Heaven, nor Damned in Hell, but only to the Souls in Purgatory: Which Doctrine is held by all the Schoolmen that follow St.</hi> Auſtin'<hi>s Opinion.</hi> Yet do we not find the two Churches ever made a Point of Controverſy thereof, or charged one another with Errour, about it. We do not find this Queſtion was agitated when the Unions were in hand, whether in the Council of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> or elſewhere, nor mention made of it in the Confeſſion of Faith which the Popes ſo often ſent them, in order to an agreement.</p>
                        <p>THE aforeſaid <hi>Allatius</hi> obſerves another Opinion of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which has ſome Relation with that I now mention'd. For they believe that when <note place="margin">Allat Diſſ. 2. de Pentecoſt.</note> our Saviour deſcended into Hell, he preached his Goſpel to all the Dead, as well to the Damned as Saints, and ſaved from amongſt them all thoſe that believed in his Word, and raiſed them up. It appears from the Paſſages pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by <hi>Allatius,</hi> as well out of their <hi>Pentecoſtare,</hi> (which is one of their Church Books,) as other Writings, that this is their Opinion: Whereas on the contrary 'tis evident, this is not the Opinion of the <hi>Latins,</hi> for they look upon it as Erroneous and Heretical. <hi>None of the damned Souls,</hi> ſay's <hi>Bellarmin, were delivered: For</hi> Philaſtrius <hi>and St.</hi> Auguſtin, ſay <hi>'tis Heretical, to aſſert</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Bellarm. de Chriſti. anim. lib. 4. Cap. 16.</note> 
                           <hi>that any of the Wicked were converted and ſaved by Chriſt's preaching in Hell. Allatius</hi> adds, that St. <hi>Ireneas</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> condemned this Errour in <hi>Marcion,</hi> and that <hi>Gregory</hi> the I. who lived towards the end of the ſixth Century, cenſured it likewiſe as an Hereſy in the Perſons of <hi>George</hi> and <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorus,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Allat. Diſſ. 2.</note> the one a Prieſt, and th'other a Deacon of the Church of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi> Now altho the Difference which is between the two Churches on this Article is manifeſt, yet we do not find they made thereof a Controverſy, or that the Authors on either ſide wrote one againſt another on this Subject, nor any mention of it in the Reunions.</p>
                        <p>WE may moreover reckon amongſt the Differences of the two Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, the Rejection which the <hi>Greek</hi> makes of ſeveral Books in the <hi>Bible,</hi> which they eſteem Apocryphal, whereas the <hi>Latins</hi> receive them, as Canonical Scripture. For 'tis certain the <hi>Greeks</hi> follow in this point the ſixtieth Canon of the of Council <hi>Laodicea,</hi> and the Authority of <hi>John Damaſcen,</hi> as appears by the Teſtimony of <hi>Metrophanus Cytropulus,</hi> who reckoning up the number of Canonical Books, which he ſay's are thirty three in all, has theſe Words. <hi>As to other Books which ſome admit into the Canon of Scripture, as the Books of</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Metroph. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs. Eccl. Orien. C 7.</note> Toby, Judith, <hi>Wiſdom of</hi> Solomon, <hi>of</hi> Jeſus <hi>Son of</hi> Sirach, Baruc, <hi>and the</hi> Maccabees; <hi>We do not believe they ought to be wholly rejected, ſeeing they contain ſeveral excellent moral Precepts. But to receive them as Canonical and Authentick Writings, is what the Church of Chriſt never did, as ſeveral Doctors teſtify, and amongst others St.</hi> Gregory <hi>the Divine, St.</hi> Amphilocus, <hi>and after them St.</hi> John Damaſcen. <hi>And therefore we ground not our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines on their Authority, but on that of the thirty three Canonical Books.</hi> So that here is the Opinion of the <hi>Greeks</hi> very oppoſite to that of the <hi>Latins,</hi> and yet we do not find they made a point of Controverſy of this Difference, nor any mention of it in their Reunions.</p>
                        <pb n="281" facs="tcp:41961:156"/>
                        <p>WE can give another Inſtance to the ſame purpoſe, and that touching the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> too. The <hi>Greeks</hi> ſince the ſeventh Century, reject the terms of Type, Figure, and Image, but the <hi>Latins</hi> uſe them, and yet they never made this a point of Controverſy betwixt them. It cannot be ſaid they ſlighted this Point; for when they explain themſelves thereon, they add to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection a form of Deteſtation. <hi>God forbid,</hi> ſay's <hi>Anaſtaſius Sinaite, that we ſhould ſay the Holy Communion is the Figure of Chriſt's Body. God forbid,</hi> ſay's <hi>Damaſcen, we ſhould think the Bread and Wine are the Figure of Chriſt's Body, and Blood.</hi> Yet how averſe ſoever they have bin to this way of ſpeaking, they never objected this as a Crime to the <hi>Latins,</hi> nor accuſed them of Error in this matter.</p>
                        <p>WE can Inſtance in ſeveral other Examples of Differences between the two Churches, about which the <hi>Greeks</hi> never fell out with the <hi>Latins;</hi> but thoſe I already denoted are ſufficient to ſhew Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> the nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his Conſequence, and at the ſame time the poſſibility of my Propoſition: For why may not Tranſubſtantiation bin paſſed over in Silence, as well as other Articles? Why muſt the negative Argument which is of no validity in theſe particulars, be good in that of Tranſubſtantiation? If the <hi>Greeks</hi> could remain in their own Opinions, and keep their Belief to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves touching the Damned, and Chriſt's preaching to them, touching the number of Canonical Books, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without entring into Debate with the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,</hi> and charging them with Error in theſe Points, why may not the ſame have hapned touching the Change relating to the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will reply without doubt, the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a Point of greater Importance, than thoſe I now mentioned, and therefore it might well happen that theſe ſlight and inconſiderable Matters were never diſputed of; but that we muſt not ſuppoſe the ſame Moderation in reference to the ſubſtantial Converſion, which holds a higher rank in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. I anſwer, firſt it cannot be ſaid theſe Articles I mentioned are of ſmall Importance. For as to the firſt of them, it is of great Importance to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Piety, not to give this Encouragement to the Wicked, that live how they will, they may hope to be delivered one day from the Pains of Hell. As to the ſecond, it has bin already reckoned amongſt the Number of Hereſies, by St. <hi>Ireneus, Epiphanius, Philaſtrius,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> the great. The third concerns the Canon of Holy Scriptures, which ought to rule our Faith, and the fourth is attended with the Execration of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> Theſe things then cannot be ſlighted as ſmall and inconſiderable Matters. But in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place I anſwer, to judg rightly of the Importance of Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we muſt conſider it, not in it ſelf, nor in relation to our preſent Diſputes, but to the <hi>Greeks</hi> and their Diſputes with the <hi>Latins;</hi> which is to ſay, we ſhould conſider what Judgment Perſons plunged in Ignorance, could make of it, and whoſe whole Religion, almoſt wholly conſiſts of <hi>Grimaces</hi> and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Ceremonies; who have lived hitherto in Diſorders and perpetual Confuſions, and have had the <hi>Latins</hi> continually to deal with, and bin for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to accommodate themſelves with them as much as poſſible, who never found Tranſubſtantiation amongſt the Points about which the two Churches diſputed in the beginning, and ſeparated afterwards, in fine, Perſons with whom the <hi>Latins</hi> never openly quarrelled about this Article, but agreed with them in certain general Terms. Let any Man conſider whether Perſons in theſe Circumſtances are capable of making all due Reflections on the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Latins,</hi> and examining the Importance and Weight of this Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:41961:157"/> which is between the Doctrines of the two Churches. Let any Man judg whether 'tis impoſſible they ſhould abſtain to make thereof a particular Controverſy, and content themſelves with their own Opinion, and Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without concerning themſelves with other People's.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. I produce in the third place, Examples of the Silence of the ſame <hi>Greeks,</hi> touching ſome Opinions of other Eaſtern Chriſtians, who have a nearer Commerce with them than the <hi>Latins,</hi> and yet we do not find they reproach them with their Opinions, nor diſpute with them about 'em. The <hi>Jacobits</hi> reject the Cuſtom of confeſſing their Sins to the Prieſt. <hi>They hold ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

He remarks their Opinion touching the Unity of our Saviour's Nature, but mentions not a Word of Confeſſion. <hi>Nicephorus Calliſtus</hi> obſerves likewiſe in his Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Hiſtory, their Hereſy touching the Unity of our Saviour's Nature, but takes no notice of their rejecting the Article of Confeſſion.</p>
                        <p>THE <hi>Neſtorians</hi> which are another Chriſtian Church in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and have as well as others their apartment in the Temple of the Holy Sepulchre at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and are conſequently continually amongſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> in this place, where their common Devotion brings them, do acknowledg no more than the <hi>Jacobits</hi> the Doctrine of Confeſſion, nor that of Confirmation, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Profeſſion of Faith of <hi>Sulak</hi> their Patriarch, which is inſerted in the <hi>Bibliotheca Patrum.</hi> Let Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſhew us if he can, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> have raiſed any Controverſies on this Subject; he I ſay that believes theſe latter, are at agreement with the <hi>Latins</hi> touching the number of ſeven Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>THOMAS a Jeſu</hi> tells us that the Pope having ſent Apoſtolical Legats for the Reforming of the <hi>Maronites,</hi> and purging their Books from ſome <note place="margin">Thom. a Jeſu. lib. 7. part. 2. c. 7.</note> Errors, <hi>which were common to them,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>as well as to other Eaſtern Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> that is to ſay other Chriſtians in that Country, they found they miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſome Paſſages of Scripture, and eſpecially that touching the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacrament, this is my Body. <hi>They affirm,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>that we must read, this is the Sacrament of my Body.</hi> Let Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> be pleaſed to tell us whether the <hi>Greeks</hi> ever cenſured the Propoſition of theſe other Eaſtern Churches in the midſt of whom they live. For if it be true that the <hi>Greeks</hi> believed Tranſubſtantiation as well as the <hi>Latins,</hi> 'tis the ſtrangeſt thing in the World they ſhould approve ſuch a Corruption, or ſuch an Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Words of Chriſt, ſeeing 'tis only on the literal Sence of theſe
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:41961:157"/> Words the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends her Doctrine is grounded.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall prove in its place, as clearly as 'tis poſſible to prove a thing of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the <hi>Armenians</hi> do not believe Tranſubſtantiation, nor the ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Preſence. This Truth will be plainly manifeſt, and yet it will not appear the <hi>Greeks</hi> ever upbraided them with this their Opinion, or made thereof a Point of Controverſy. Were it fair to argue from the Silence of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> might I not conclude from their not diſturbing the <hi>Armenians</hi> in reference to this matter, that they are agreed with them to reject theſe Doctrines, and conclude it too with a thouſand times more Strength and Evidence, than Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> concludes they are at Agreement with the <hi>Latins</hi> to believe it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not make thereof a Controverſy.</p>
                        <p>AND here methinks are Inſtances enough to overthrow Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Argument, and diſcover the weakneſs of his Conſequence. But we muſt proceed farther, for having ſhewed him that the Principle on which I ground my Anſwer is reaſonable, to wit, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not believe Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, altho they never diſputed againſt it, I will likewiſe ſhew him there is all the likelyhood in the World that the matter is as I lay it down, whence it will follow that not only his Conſequence has no Neceſſity, but even no Probability.</p>
                        <p>I. FOR this Effect it will be neceſſary to call to mind the profound Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance wherein the <hi>Greeks</hi> have lived from the eleventh Century, till this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. For I already related in the ſecond Book what <hi>Wm.</hi> of <hi>Tyre, James de Vitry, Belon, Cottovic, Anthony Caucus, Francis Richard, Allatius, du Loir, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venot,</hi> and <hi>Barbereau</hi> the Jeſuit have written of this matter. I moreover pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Teſtimonies of <hi>Bozius,</hi> and <hi>Thomas a Jeſu.</hi> All which has no other end but to ſhew us the miſerable Condition wherein this Church has for ſo long time layn. Obſerve here likewiſe what ſay's a Latiniz'd Monk called <hi>Barlaam,</hi> who lived about the beginning of the fourteenth Century. <hi>There are,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Barlaam Epiſt. 1. Bibl. patr. Tom. 2. Edit. 4.</note> ſay's he, <hi>few Perſons amongſt them that trouble themſelves with Learning: And there are yet fewer that apply themſelves to the Study of the Scriptures, preferring the Heatheniſh Sciences above it, to which they willingly apply themſelves. All the People in general are ignorant eſpecially of that Holy Word that brings Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; So that for one Perſon amongst them that understands the Summary of the Chriſtian Faith, there are Millions ignorant of it.</hi> Obſerve here moreover what <hi>Cyrillus Lucaris</hi> (the ſame Patriarch mentioned in the preceding Book) writes. <hi>I can bear with the Ignorance of the common People, for I know their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi>

                           <hi>and Simplicity can defend them againſt the Enemies of their Faith, whom they Combat not with Arms, but Patience, and ſo remain faithful to Jeſus Chriſt. But I cannot bear with the Ignorance and Stupidity of our Paſtors and Biſhops; and therefore I continually upbraid them with it, but to no purpoſe. The Jeſuits making their advantage thereof, have ſetled themſelves in</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>to inſtruct Youth, and are like Foxes amongſt Geeſe.</hi> It is certain we can find no Book from this People worth our Reading, written ſince <hi>Photius</hi>'s time, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting ſome few Hiſtories, and Collections of the antient Canons, the reſt only conſiſting in Explanations of their Liturgy, and ſome pittiful Treatiſes, wherein they Tranſcribe one out of another Word for Word, without any Art, or Sence almoſt.</p>
                        <p>II. WE ſhould likewiſe conſider the temporal State of <hi>Greece</hi> ſince the eleventh Century to this preſent, for there can be nothing imagined more
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:41961:158"/> dreadful and miſerable. Moſt of their Emperors have been either lazy or effeminate, continually accompanied with Misfortunes, or Prophane and Impious Perſons that made a Mock of Religion, or Villains that aſcended the Throne by Seditions and Murthers, by means whereof <hi>Greece</hi> became divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Factions and horrible Confuſions.

His Nephew whoſe Name alſo was <hi>Alexius,</hi> addreſſing himſelf to the <hi>Latins,</hi> they drove out the Uſurper from the Throne, and ſetled him in it, againſt whom aroſe one <hi>Murſulphus,</hi> and both one, and the other, having undone themſelves by their Perfidiouſneſs, the Empire fell into the Hands of the <hi>Latins</hi> in the Year 1204.</p>
                        <p>THE <hi>Latins</hi> held the Empire fifty eight Years till 1261, wherein <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Paleologus</hi> took the City of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> from them. Which <hi>Michael</hi> obtained the Empire by Murther, he cauſed the lawful Emperors Eyes to be put out (who was <hi>John Theodorus Laſcaris</hi>'s Son, being but twelve Years of Age, and ſeated himſelf in his Throne. He was both a cruel and crafty Prince, and abuſed his Subjects in a thouſand manners, being ever ready to Sacrifice the Church and Religion to his Intereſt. <hi>Andronicus</hi> his Son ſucceded him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom his Grandſon named likewiſe <hi>Andronicus</hi> aroſe ſeveral times, and at length took from him his Crown, and reduced him to the condition of a

                        <p>III. IT already appears to be no wonder, if a Church amids ſuch dreadful Confuſions and Circumſtances, and oreſpread with ſuch Clouds of Darkneſs, never exactly diſcuſſed the Difference betwixt its Doctrine and the <hi>Latins,</hi> but contented her ſelf with keeping her own Belief. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider we moreover the Influence the <hi>Latins</hi> had on the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner after which they handled them, whereſoever they got the maſtery. We have ſeen in the ſecond Book how they drove the Greek Biſhops from <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> as ſoon as ever they ſetled themſelves, as likewiſe in <hi>Greece.</hi> We have alſo obſerved that the Greek Emperors inſtead of encouraging their Patriarchs and Biſhops, and upholding the Intereſt of their Church, have on the contrary favoured to the utmoſt of their Power the <hi>Latins,</hi> and under pretence of an Union endeavoured to ſubject the Greek Church to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Not that theſe Emperors had any kindneſs for the Religion of the <hi>Latins,</hi> but feared their Power, and therefore uſed all poſſible Complyance with the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> They would not ſuffer its Doctrines to be ill ſpoken of. We have ſeen that in <hi>Leo</hi> the ninths Quarrel with <hi>Cerularius, Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Monomaque</hi> fail'd not to take <hi>Leo</hi>'s Part, countenancing his Legats, and conſtraining <hi>Nicetas Pectoratus</hi> to burn his own Book, which he wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Latins.</hi> We have likewiſe obſerv'd that <hi>John Veccus</hi> Library keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Church at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſaying one day in the Emperor's hearing, <hi>that altho the</hi> Latins <hi>were not termed Hereticks, yet they really were ſo. Michael Paleologus</hi> was thereupon ſo inraged, that he reſolved to ruin him, cauſing him ſoon after to be impriſoned, and had effected his Reſolution, had not <hi>Veccus</hi> changed his Mind. Moreover 'twas not two or three of theſe Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors that were of this Temper, but almoſt all of 'em, as appears by what I already related in the ſecond Book. We muſt then add to the ſecond Preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conſiderations this third Remark, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> were forc'd to be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for fear of the <hi>Latins,</hi> and their own Emperors. It may be perhaps re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, this hindred them not from Diſputing on the <hi>Proceſſion</hi> and <hi>Azymes.</hi> I grant it, but there is a great deal of Difference betwixt maintaining old Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, and raiſing new ones, which commonly beget Hatred. The <hi>Latins</hi> and the Emperors laboured to make them ſilent in the old Controverſies, how then could they ſuffer without the greateſt Puniſhment, there ſhould be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers begun, which would render the Deſign of a Reconciliation more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult?</p>

                        <p>IV. BUT beſides what I already mentioned, it is requiſite to obſerve for what end the Emperors endeavoured this Reconciliation, ſeeing this will give us a great deal of light into the Queſtion. <hi>Pachymerus</hi> relates that <hi>Michael Paleologus</hi> uſed this only Argument with his Biſhops, namely, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Agreement, there ſhould be no alteration made in their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Do not doubt,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>but after this Peace the Church ſhall remain in its</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Pachymer. hiſt. lib. 5. cap. 18.</note> 
                           <hi>former ſtate; It ſhall not be my Fault if it does not:</hi> And again, <hi>You need not be told by me how ready our Forefathers have been to comply, as often as the publick Good required it. They conſidered that even God himſelf has not diſdained to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodate himſelf to our Weakneſſes, in taking upon him our Fleſh, and Suffering the Pains of the Croſs, by which he hath purchaſed the Salvation of the World, ſo ready was he to comply with our Exigencies; no man can then blame us if from the like Intention we endeavour to avoid the Dangers that threaten us, but on the contrary we ſhall be the better approved of, by thoſe that underſtand the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Affairs.</hi> And again, <hi>You muſt not affright the People by telling 'em, we deſign to proceed any farther in this Reconciliation than we ought, and as if we intended to change our ancient Cuſtoms and Ceremonies for thoſe of the</hi> Latins, <hi>and make the ſame Confeſſion of Faith as they do.</hi> Which Diſcourſe does ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly ſhew us three things. Firſt, that there is a great deal of Difference between being ſilent in the Doctrine of the <hi>Latins,</hi> not Diſputing and Charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with Error, nay proceeding ſo far as a Union with them, and the Imbracing of their Doctrines; let Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſay what he pleaſes. For <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> deſires but the firſt of theſe, and proteſts he intends not thereby to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the other. The ſecond thing that appears from the Diſcourſe of this Emperor, is that the Principle on which I ground my Anſwer, and by which I pretend to overthrow Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Argument, is not a Propoſition forged in my own Brain from the neceſſity of my Diſpute, but a Principle not only well known by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> but approved and practiſed in an Occaſion, far more important than that now in queſtion betwixt us. For 'tis far leſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant to lay aſide one of the Doctrines of a Church, and not Diſpute on it, than to be united with her, and yet 'tis certain the Greek Church conſented to this Reunion, in hope ſhe ſhould keep her Religion Intire, and not receive any of the Doctrines of the <hi>Latins.</hi> In fine, I gather from <hi>Michael</hi>'s Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and the Effect it had on the Minds of his Clergy, that the only care the <hi>Greeks</hi> took was to keep their own Religion, being willing to be ſilent, and Imbrace the Union, provided they were not forced to Imbrace the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the <hi>Latins.</hi> If it be replied that this was indeed the Diſpoſition of <hi>Michael Paleologus,</hi> but not that of his Church; I anſwer that <hi>Michael</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged 'em to conſent to the Reunion upon this Regard, that each of the Churches ſhould keep its own Opinions, and not contend and charge one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother with Error. Now People are not wont to be prevailed on by Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which they do not acknowledg to be good, and therefore plauſible Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and fair Colours are made uſe to win them. Whence it follows, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> were far from imagining, 'twas the ſame thing not to diſpute againſt the <hi>Latins</hi> on an Article, and to receive and own it with them. Whence it likewiſe follows, that if this Reaſon or Hope which <hi>Michael</hi> propoſed to them was ſufficient to make them do a thing in which they feared he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, (as indeed he did) a matter which was contrary to their Duty and Conſcience, and againſt which they had moreover the greateſt Averſion, it might likewiſe be ſufficient to withhold and hinder them from doing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, to which they did not believe they were obliged, and from which they might refrain without the leaſt Violence to their Inclinations.</p>
                        <pb n="287" facs="tcp:41961:159"/>
                        <p>THIS Reflection will be ſtrengthened by conſidering after what ſort <hi>Veccus</hi> the Patriarch juſtified himſelf when he became a great ſtickler in the Union, which he endeavoured to promote as much as in him lay. <hi>I never</hi>

                           <hi>deſign'd,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>by any thing I either thought, ſaid, or did to diſparage any of the Ceremonies or Doctrines of the</hi> Greeks, <hi>but only to eſtabliſh the Peace of the Church. If any Perſon in imbracing this Peace has deſpiſed our Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and preferred the Doctrines and Ceremonies of the Roman Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, let him be excluded the Kingdom of Heaven, and have his Portion with the Traytor</hi> Judas <hi>and his Companions, who Cracified our Saviour.</hi> We ſee here this Patriarch ſuppoſes a great deal of Difference between the not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the <hi>Latins,</hi> and letting them alone with their Doctrines; Nay ſo far is he from granting Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Conſequence, that he makes this a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple whereby to juſtify himſelf to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which is a Sign that this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition agreed with the Genius of that Nation. For People are not wont to juſtify themſelves by Maxims odious and publickly abhorred; if <hi>Michael Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leologus, Veccus,</hi> or the <hi>Greeks</hi> in general, have diſpleaſed Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> by this their Deportment, they are excuſable: For in thoſe Days the World was not acquainted with the Secrets of his Reaſoning: The Rules of his Logick were not then publiſhed. They may henceforward become a Rule to Poſterity, but he muſt not expect they ſhould be more priviledged than the Edicts of Princes which have no retroactive Virtue.</p>
                        <p>V. TO convince Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> that the <hi>Greeks</hi> are averſe to Controverſies; I need only repreſent to him what <hi>Anthony Eparkus</hi> of <hi>Corcyra</hi> wrote to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip Melancthon.</hi> For having told him how careful the <hi>Turks</hi> are to eſtabliſh their Religion every where, and to extend the Limits of their Empire. <hi>It</hi>

It behoves us to watch and apply our ſelves diligently to the avoiding the Danger threatning us, leſt we loſe our Poſſeſſions here on Earth, whilſt we idly and over curiouſly inquire into the things of Heaven.</hi> 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not care to concern themſelves overmuch about the things of the next Life: Their Thoughts being wholly taken up with their worldly Intereſt, this being the Key that opens and ſhuts their Mouths.</p>

                           <hi>POSSEVIN</hi> the Jeſuit diſtinguiſhes the <hi>Greeks</hi> into three Ranks, the firſt of People <hi>who are very Ignorant:</hi> The ſecond, of <hi>thoſe that having ſome</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Biblioth. ſelert. de rat. ag. cum Grec. lib. 5. cap. 24.</note> 
                           <hi>Experience, and beholding on one hand the Majeſty of the Roman Church, and on the other the Miſery of the Greek one, the Pomp of the Sacrament of the</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins, <hi>and the Neglect wherewith the</hi> Greeks <hi>treat theirs, conclude that the Roman Church is better beloved by God almighty than the Greek one. The third is of thoſe who having ſome knowledg of the World, are yet tranſported by an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Hatred againſt the</hi> Latins, <hi>altho their Biſhops and moſt prudent Perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them are of another Temper, and not knowing for the moſt part, what they ſay or would have; they Compare the Greek and Roman Church together, their Ceremonies with ours, and prefer their Prieſts to our Latin Prieſts, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them not ſo vicious as ours. Yet they dare not affirm we are in an Error, or that what we believe or practiſe touching the Sacrament is unwarrantable. But they affirm as to themſelves, that they are in the right Way, and do not doubt of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in their own Religion.</hi> Obſerve theſe two things, firſt that the Greek Biſhops and prudenteſt Perſons in their Church, are averſe to Controverſies. And ſecondly, that thoſe that are not, content themſelves with maintaining their own Doctrines, without condemning thoſe of the <hi>Latins.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="288" facs="tcp:41961:160"/>
                        <p>VI. BUT it will be demanded why then did they Diſpute on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Holy Spirit, and the <hi>Azymes?</hi> I anſwer becauſe theſe two Points firſt occaſioned the Separation of the two Churches. <hi>Photius</hi> adhered eſpecially to the firſt of theſe, and <hi>Cerularius</hi> to the latter. The reaſon why the <hi>Greeks</hi> have ſo earneſtly ſtuck to theſe two Particulars, ſeems to be out of a Principle of Conſtancy. They have followed the firſt and original Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of their Quarrel with the <hi>Latins,</hi> treading in the Steps of their Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. Had they found the Article of the ſubſtantial Converſion in their way, they had without doubt ſtumbled at it, but not meeting with it, 'tis no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel if they took no notice thereof, no more than of other Doctrines. But why was not this point at firſt comprehended amongſt thoſe that cauſed the Separation of the two Churches? The Anſwer is eaſy; becauſe Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation was not then eſtabliſhed in the Roman Church. <hi>Photius</hi> began the Separation towards the end of the ninth Century: <hi>Cerularius</hi> renewed it about the middle of the eleventh, and the firſt that determin'd the ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Converſion was <hi>Gregory</hi> the VII, in the Year 1079, ſo that 'tis no marvel if they diſputed not about it.</p>
                        <p>VII. NEITHER do I underſtand the <hi>Greeks</hi> could have juſt Cauſe to diſpute this Point againſt the Body of the Latin Church in general, before the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> that is to ſay, before the fifteenth Century: For altho <hi>Gregory</hi> the VII made his Determination in the Year 1079, as I already ſaid, and <hi>Innocent</hi> the III had done the ſame in the Council of <hi>Latran,</hi> in the Year 1215, yet there were ſeveral People that did not eſteem theſe kind of Deciſions as legitimate and authentick Declarations of the Church. Every body knows that <hi>Rupert</hi> who lived in the twelveth Century, publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Rupert. in Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. lib. 6. &amp; in Exod. l. 2. c. 10.</note> taught that the ſubſtance of Bread remains in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and becomes the Body of Chriſt by an hypoſtatical Union with the Word. <hi>Anſelm</hi> wrote againſt him, and <hi>Algerus</hi> diſputed againſt his Opinion, but he was never Condemned for an Heretick. We know likewiſe what <hi>Durand</hi> of St. <hi>Porcien</hi> taught, who lived in the beginning of the fourteenth Century, to wit, that the Subſtance of Bread remains, and that loſing its firſt form of Bread, it receives the form of the Body of Chriſt, in the ſame manner the Food we take receives the form of our Body. <note n="*" place="margin">Bell. de Sacr.

Yet it ſays that neither of theſe two ways has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the Church, and therefore never a one of them is an Article of Faith, and if it ſaid otherwiſe, it would not have ſaid ſo well, and thoſe that expreſs themſelves otherwiſe, ſay not ſo well, and he that poſitively aſſerts that either one or the other of theſe Modes is an Article of Faith, incurs the Sentence of an</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathema.

                        <p>
                           <hi>JOHN</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> met with Oppoſition from <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Orillac</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſeveral other Biſhops. Yet did they not condemn his Sentiment, nor contradict what the Faculty of Theology ſaid, but ſilenced him, and forbad him the Chair; Whereat he made his Appeal to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he came himſelf, and had a Committy appointed to hear him, but <hi>John</hi> dying before his Affair was ended, the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> proceeded no farther in it. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> who will needs have the <hi>Greeks</hi> not to be ignorant of what paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed amongſt the <hi>Latins,</hi> and ſuppoſes all <hi>Greece</hi> to reſound with <hi>Berengarius</hi>'s Condemnation; and Peoples <hi>Italy</hi> with <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Greece</hi> with <hi>Latins,</hi> with order to give one another account of whatſoever concerned the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, who will have the very Soldiers entertain themſelves with it in the Army, as well as the Pilgrims in their Voyages; can he I ſay find in his Heart to tell us, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> knew not what ſuch famous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors as <hi>Rupert, Durand, John</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Dailly</hi> publickly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the twelvth, thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth Century, that they knew not what paſſed in one of the chief Cities in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and in a Faculty ſo illuſtrious as that of <hi>Paris,</hi> that they knew not an Affair that was carried to <hi>Rome,</hi> and touching which that Court made no Deciſſion? In truth if they knew nothing of this, and that neither the Pilgrims, nor Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, nor Soldiers, nor Inquiſitors, nor the <hi>Greeks</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> nor the <hi>Latins</hi> in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> gave them no Notice thereof, they may have been ignorant as well of other things, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Aſſurance ſignifies nothing, <hi>that their Curioſity made them ſearch into all things.</hi> For altho that in ſome of theſe Centuries there were no more Croiſado's into the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> nor <hi>Latins</hi> that held the Greek Empire; yet the Commerce between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> was frequent, and both one and thother were often together in <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other places; and it was a very eaſy matter to ſend Notice to the <hi>Greeks</hi> of what paſſed in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> concerning theſe Doctors. Should Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſay they knew this, he muſt not take it ill, if they made this a Reaſon for their Silence and Reſervedneſs; For why ſhould they accuſe a Church wherein it is permitted to affirm, that the Subſtance of Bread remains, wherein it is affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that there is nothing to be poſitively aſſerted concerning the Subject of Tranſubſtantiation, and Appeals made to <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf thereupon, and yet this Court does not ſo much as declare the contrary.</p>
                        <pb n="290" facs="tcp:41961:161"/>
                        <p>VIII. SUPPOSING the <hi>Greeks</hi> believed Tranſubſtantiation, how came it to paſs they were not ſcandaliz'd at the boldneſs of all theſe Authors? Why would they not ſatisfy themſelves in ſo conſiderable a Point as that which theſe Authors handled, namely that the Church had not yet determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned any thing touching the Converſion of the Subſtance of Bread? Why did they not reprove the <hi>Latins</hi> for this, and eſpecially the Roman Church for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſilent in a Particular wherein her Belief and Practice were concern'd. Let Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> give us a Reaſon for this Reſervedneſs of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who makes them ſuch great Diſputers? And let him alſo ſhew us a Reaſon for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Silence? That the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation is not an Article of Faith, and that the Church has not yet determin'd it ſo to be, we find <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> ready to juſtify within the Walls of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, and yet ſhe takes no notice of it. She ſuffers a Perſon to dye in this Error, neither Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns his Opinion, nor Memory, and that which is moreover worſe, is, that ſhe leaves the whole World in ſuſpence about a Point wherein the Faith of all her Children are concern'd. For if a man doubts whether the Converſion of Subſtances be a Point of Faith, he cannot believe it as a Point of Faith. And if a man cannot believe it as a Point of Faith, how will he be perſwaded of the Truth of it? And if it muſt be held only as a probable Opinion of Learned men, what will become of it when we ſhall find it ſo improbable, and ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle agreeable to right Reaſon? Yet does not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> mention a Word of this, but lets the Queſtion ly <hi>Dormant,</hi> ſo that ſhould we argue from her Silence, as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does from that of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> we might conclude ſhe approves <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> his Opinion, ſeeing ſhe does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it. Yet will I not go ſo far; It ſuffices me that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has not condemned the Propoſition in Queſtion. This is enough to hinder the <hi>Greeks</hi> from Reproaching the Latin Church with Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
                        <p>THIS Affair of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> together with the Judgment of the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Theology, and Silence of the Roman Church, is of ſuch Importance, that this alone is ſufficient to decide the Queſtion, and manifeſt to Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> that the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation has not been perpetual in the Church. For that a Faculty ſo conſiderable as is that of <hi>Paris</hi> ſhould aſſure us this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Exiſtence of Chriſt's Body in the Euchariſt, is not determined by the Church, nor is an Article of Faith, and whoſoever ſhall aſſert that it is ſo, ought to be Anathematiz'd. That the Affair having been carried to <hi>Rome,</hi> and that Court be ſilent therein, and determine nothing about it; I ſay this is enough to refute this pretended <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has taken upon him to defend.</p>
                        <p>BUT return we to the <hi>Greeks.</hi> We may add to what I already mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this conſiderable Remark, which is, that the <hi>Latins</hi> never raiſed a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with the <hi>Greeks</hi> about the general Expreſſions which theſe laſt make uſe of touching the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT before we carry on this Conſideration any farther, it is neceſſary that I put the Reader again in mind, that the Queſtion is not to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Greeks</hi> have the ſame Opinion with us touching the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> much leſs whether they explain themſelves after the ſame manner. This is Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi>'s perpetual Illuſion, to ſuppoſe we make them <hi>Berengarians;</hi> and 'tis on this wrong Ground whereon he builds his whole Diſcourſe. We ſcarcely meet with any other but theſe kind of Arguings in his Diſpute, <hi>viz.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:41961:161"/> the <hi>Greeks</hi> were <hi>Berengariens</hi>? Whether they Believed the Bread in the Sacrament to be only a Figure? Whether they underſtood our Saviour's Words in the Sence of <hi>Significat, &amp;c.</hi> To the end then the Reader may not be deceived, I do here again acknowledg that the <hi>Greeks</hi> believe a great deal more touching the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> than we do, that they expreſs themſelves otherwiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and follow neither the Sentiments nor Expreſſions of <hi>Berengarius.</hi> Neither have we given Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> any Occaſion to aſſert what he does. We only affirm'd they do not believe the Tranſubſtantiation of the Roman Church, nor worſhipped the Sacrament with a ſovereign Adoration; and 'tis upon this Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ought to argue to deal ſincerely.</p>
                        <p>AND therefore I ſay the <hi>Latins</hi> never diſputed with the <hi>Greeks</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Expreſſions, how general ſoever they have been; They have indeed done what they could whereby to introduce inſenſibly amongſt them the Terms of <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, and of <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Tranſubſtantiation, change of Subſtance.</hi> They have for this purpoſe made uſe of their Proſelytes, and Scholars of the Seminaries, to whom they have given the Confeſſion of Faith which we obſerved in the preceding Book, in which thoſe Terms are found. They have ſet 'em down in Latin in the Acts of the Reunion. But in the Greek of theſe ſame Acts, they have contented themſelves with the general Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, as we have already ſeen. They have not quarrelled with them about 'em, for Reaſons not hard to be underſtood, and which we ſhall ſee hereafter, and when the Proſelytes and Scholars of the Seminaries found their Terms were not receiv'd, they became angry thereat, but on the contrary accomodated themſelves to others. We cannot then won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if this Conduct has kept the <hi>Greeks</hi> from diſcuſſing any farther the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences which ſeparate the two Churches. They agreed in the general Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that the Bread is made the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, that 'tis changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Body, and the <hi>Latins</hi> required no more.</p>
                        <p>THE Snare lay hid under this Complyance, and this Conduct kept off the <hi>Greeks</hi> from all Inquiries. For, for to find the Difference there is between the Doctrine of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and that of the <hi>Latins,</hi> and make a right Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereon, we muſt not lightly and ſuperficially examine them, ſeeing they require an application of Mind and Study. We muſt read Latin Authors, compare them with the Doctrine of the Ancients, and with that of the Greek Church, and not ſuffer our ſelves to be ſurprized with falſe appearances, but conſider the two Doctrines themſelves, and eſpecially their Conſequences, to find wherein they differ; For at firſt Sight the Difference ſeems not great. They explain themſelves ſometimes in the like manner, but their Conſequences infinitely differ, as has been obſerved in the laſt Chapter of the preceding Book. Now how few amongſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> have been able to go thro with this Diſcuſſion; and of thoſe that were capable, how few were in a condition to make a right Judgment? We have ſeen what <hi>Bozius</hi> ſaid of 'em from the Relation of one <hi>Gregory, that under the Empire of</hi> Andronicus, (he means I ſuppoſe <hi>Andronicus</hi> the younger, in whoſe Reign the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union of the Churches was again propoſed) <hi>there was no Perſon to be found in all</hi> Greece, <hi>that was able to Diſpute with the</hi> Latins <hi>about Religious Matters.</hi> Can it ſeem ſtrange, that People (who could not maintain their ancient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, ſo greatly inſiſted on by their Fathers, and which are as it were hereditary to them,) ſhould neglect to diſcuſs thoſe new Doctrines I ſpeak of, and content themſelves with keeping their own Belief, without concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves with that of Strangers?</p>
                        <pb n="292" facs="tcp:41961:162"/>
                        <p>X. MOREOVER we muſt conſider that the <hi>Greeks</hi> have ever referred to almighty God, the knowledg of the Change hap'ning in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> without offering to determine it. This appears as well by their general Terms, as by what I already related, concerning the Confeſſion of <hi>Metrophanus</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and the profeſſion of Faith compiled for the Sarra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen Proſelytes, from the Prayer in their <hi>Euchology,</hi> the Judgment which <hi>Nicetas</hi> made on the Conduct of the Patriarch <hi>Camaterus,</hi> and the Diſpute of <hi>John</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> When then they hear the <hi>Latins</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the manner of this Change, ſaying 'tis a real Converſion of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bread and Wine; we muſt not find it ſtrange, if they contain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their generalities, and neither Receive nor Condemn this Doctrine. Whether they do well or ill in this, I ſhall not here determine: But howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, 'tis in no wiſe ſtrange that People of that Temper the <hi>Greeks</hi> are of, ſhould thus deport themſelves. I have already obſerved elſewhere that he that ſhewed himſelf moſt forward amongſt them, was the Patriarch <hi>Cyrillus;</hi> for he proceeded ſo far as to a poſitive Rejection of Tranſubſtantiation, and yet he rejected it only under the Title of <hi>Raſh,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, ſay's he, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Tranſubſtantiation raſhly invented.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>ALL which things being conſidered, let any Man judg whether what I ſay (concerning the <hi>Greeks</hi> not expreſly oppoſing the Doctrine of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Subſtances, altho they did not believe it) be not grounded on all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable Probability, and whether on the contrary Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Conſequence, how ſurpriſing ſoever it may ſeem at firſt, is not in effect void of all kind of Probability. They have lived time out of mind in moſt ſtupid Ignorance; They have been overwhelmed in Confuſions, and oppreſſed with domeſtick Misfortunes: They have been continually urged by their Emperors to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the <hi>Latins,</hi> that they might thereby avoid their Diſpleaſure, and procure their Favour; They have been perſwaded that this Complyance will bring no Prejudice to their Religion. They are moreover a People that were ever noted to be naturally more than others fixt to their temporal Intereſts, preferring the Preſervation of their Eſtates, before their Religion. They are not ignorant how the Roman Church reſents it, when accuſed of Error, as appears by the Complaint of <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> who ſpeaking of the <hi>Latins,</hi> ſay's <hi>that they obſtinately defend whatſoever they do, right or wrong, let their Errors be made</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Epist. Cyrill. ad Wittemb. in Epist. Viror. erud.</note> 
                           <hi>never ſo apparent. That they maintain they can neither Err in Belief nor Practice, and that which is yet worſe, they fly in the Faces of thoſe that Chriſtianly admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them, and ſhew them their Errors. That they perſecute ſuch with Fire and Sword, as if it were not lawful to repel the Injury they do to Chriſtianity, and to guard and defend our ſelves against the Evil.</hi> It appears in their ordinary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, how reſerved and fearful they are of offending the <hi>Latins.</hi> The Queſtion of Tranſubſtantiation is not to be found amongſt their primitive and original Diſputes. They might likewiſe reaſonably doubt whether the Roman Church determin'd it before the Council of <hi>Constance.</hi> The <hi>Latins</hi> have not diſputed with them about it, but accommodated themſelves to the form of their Expreſſions. It is no eaſy matter for them to penetrate as far as the real Differences which diſtinguiſh the Doctrines of the two Churches. And in fine, one of their Maxims is, that they may very well leave the Knowledg of the Change which happens in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> unto God, without troubling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves any farther about it. Is it not nearer to Truth to ſay as I do, that it does not follow theſe People believed Tranſubſtantiation, altho they have not made thereof a Point of Controverſy, and kept themſelves in a kind of

                           <hi>Medium,</hi> neither Believing it, nor Condemning it; than to ſay as Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> does, that if they have not oppoſed it, nor diſputed on it, nor reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Roman Church with it as an Error, it inevitably follows, they have, and do ſtill believe it.</p>

He tells us <hi>Eutymius</hi> wrote a Book againſt <note place="margin">Lib. 2. c. 11. p. 204.</note> the <hi>Latins,</hi> in which he only treats of the Proceſſion of the Holy Spirit, that <hi>Chryſolanus</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Milain</hi> reduced to this ſingle Article, all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he upbraided the <hi>Greeks</hi> with; that <hi>John Phurnius</hi> wrote againſt <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                           <hi>Chryſolanus,</hi> and mentions only the <hi>Proceſſion;</hi> and that this ſame <hi>Phurnius</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 205. Ibid. p. 204. Ibid. p. 205.</note> diſputed againſt another Archbiſhop of <hi>Milain</hi> named <hi>Peter,</hi> on this Article alone. But if Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> goes on after this rate, what will become of the Controverſy touching the <hi>Azyme.</hi> He tells us that <hi>Nicolas Methonienſis</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers <hi>Chryſolanus,</hi> and that he wrote another Treatiſe concerning the <hi>Azy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</hi> that <hi>Euſtratius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nice, Theodorus Prodromus, Nicetas Seidus,</hi> and ſeveral other Authors of the twelveth Century that wrote againſt the <hi>Latins,</hi> applyed themſelves only to the Controverſies touching the Holy Spirit, and the <hi>Azymes.</hi> He makes an exact Computation of all the <hi>Greeks</hi> of the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Century, that wrote againſt the Roman Church, and aſſures us they <note place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 7.</note> all of 'em reſtrain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d themſelves to theſe two Points. He farther ſhews us <note place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 2.</note> that in the Treaty of Agreement, which was begun in the Year 1232, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Gregory</hi> the IX, and <hi>Germain</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> there <note place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 4.</note> were no more mentioned than theſe two Queſtions; and that the Patriarch <hi>Veccus</hi> having been condemned under <hi>Andronicus,</hi> for favouring the <hi>Latins,</hi> his whole charge conſiſted only of the Proceſſion of the Holy Spirit. So that
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:41961:163"/> if we ſtop here, we may reſtrain the differences of the two Churches to theſe two Articles, and eſtabliſh an intire Conformity in all the reſt.</p>
                        <p>AS faſt as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> produces each of theſe things in particular, he fails not to conclude that the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> had but one and the ſame Faith touching Tranſubſtantiation. But how happens it he has not ſeen, that if his Conſequence be good, it may be likewiſe concluded they have the ſame Opinion touching other Articles, wherein yet is found a manifeſt Difference? His Proofs have this Property, that if we take each of 'em in particular, they overthrow one another. For if the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> taught only, one and the ſame thing, why are they made to diſpute touching the Proceſſion of the Holy Spirit. If all their Differences may be reduced to the Article of the Holy Spirit, why do they diſpute on the <hi>Azymes</hi>? If they be divided only in theſe two Points, wherefore in the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> was there mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Doctrine of Purgatory, the beatifical Viſion of the Saints, and prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the See of <hi>Rome</hi>? What certainty is there in all theſe negative Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſeeing that each of 'em in particular overthrow one another?</p>
                        <p>HE will tell us we muſt take them all together, and conclude from thence in general that the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> are not at all at Variance touching Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, ſeeing that in all their Diſputes agitated ſince ſo long a time, by ſo many ſeveral Authors, and ſo many ſeveral Occaſions, we do not find any Conteſt touching this Point. I anſwer, we have taken them thus in the preceding Chapter, and found they conclude no better in general than in particular. I conſent they be taken in any ſort; for if they be examined each of 'em apart, their weakneſſes will ſoon be diſcovered, being contradictory to one another, and if joyned together, they can produce no greater effect by their Union, than to perſwade us the <hi>Greeks</hi> never made Tranſubſtantiation a Point of Controverſy with the <hi>Latins.</hi> But this is no more than what we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready granted to Mr. <hi>Arnand.</hi> But that it follows hence the two Churches held this for an Article of both their Faiths: This we deny, and have given our Reaſons why we do ſo.</p>
                        <p>BUT the more to facilitate the Judgment which ought to be made of theſe things, it will not be amiſs to examine ſome particular Circumſtances, by which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has pretended to give Colour to his Argument. He tells us then, firſt, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> have been often together with the <hi>Latins</hi> in Councils, and yet there was never any mention made of Tranſubſtantiation <note place="margin">Lib. 2. c. 8. p. 171. Lib. 2. c. 11. p. 210. Ibid.</note> therein: That they were together at the Synod of <hi>Barris</hi> where <hi>Anſelm</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted againſt 'em: That the Abbot <hi>Nectairus</hi> was an aſſeſſor at the Council of <hi>Latran</hi> under <hi>Alexander</hi> the III. That the Emperor <hi>Emanuel</hi> aſſembled a Council at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in order to a Reunion, wherein the two Parties fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to appear: That there was one held at <hi>Nice</hi> upon the ſame Occaſion: That <hi>Michael Paleologus</hi> called ſeveral Aſſemblies in <hi>Greece</hi> for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: <note place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 2. p. 262. Lib. 3. c. 3. Ibid. Lib. 4. c. 2.</note> That he ſent his Legats and Deputies from the Greek Church to the Council at <hi>Lyons,</hi> in which the Reunion was concluded, and that in fine, they met together in the Council of <hi>Florence.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I anſwer, there was never any Council held, either in the <hi>East</hi> or <hi>West,</hi> by the <hi>Greeks</hi> alone, or <hi>Latins,</hi> nor by <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> both together, wherein all the Differences of the two Churches were propoſed to be examined. There were never any Points handled in them, but thoſe which were ever openly and expreſly controverted, and even not all of them neither. In the Synod
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:41961:163"/> of <hi>Barry,</hi> there was only handled the Point of the Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt. Does this argue they agreed in all the reſt? <hi>There was not,</hi> ſay's Mr. <hi>Arnaud, any other Difference in the Doctrines of Faith.</hi> But what matter is it whether the other Differences were concerning Articles of Faith, ſeeing the <hi>Greeks</hi> made them the occaſion of their Separation, and ſtuck to 'em with all poſſible earneſtneſs? Moreover, who told Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> that the <hi>Greeks</hi> eſteem not the Article of the <hi>Azymes</hi> as a Point of Faith, and likewiſe thoſe of Purgatory, and the Pope's Supremacy, <hi>&amp;c? Neither the</hi> Greeks <hi>nor the</hi> Latins, ſay's Mr. <hi>Arnaud, ſuppoſed there were any other Differences between them in Points of Faith, than that touching the Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Yet did they not agree in their Opinions about Purgatory, nor the Pope's Supremacy, and yet according to Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> the <hi>Latins</hi> of thoſe times reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned not theſe Doctrines amongſt the Articles of their Faith. Sure I am there are People of his own Communion who will not juſtify him in this Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>'TIS the ſame in reference to the Council of <hi>Lateran.</hi> He is willing to make uſe of it, becauſe he finds it amongſt his Collections, but it will be a hard matter for him to ſhew what paſt therein touching the <hi>Greeks,</hi> for all that he can know of it, is contained in the Letters of <hi>George</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Corcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> to the Abbot <hi>Nectairus,</hi> and from the Abbot's Letters again to <hi>George,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Baron. ad ann. 1179.</note> mentioned by <hi>Baronius,</hi> and which relate not a Word to the purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>TO refute what he tells us concerning the Council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Emanuel Comnenus,</hi> I need only mention what he himſelf relates. <hi>That the</hi> Latins <hi>require no more of the</hi> Greeks, <hi>than that they ſhould mention the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 2. c. 11. p. 210.</note> 
                           <hi>Pope's Name in their publick Offices, acknowledg his Supremacy, and right of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals.</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, that all the reſt ſignified nothing, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Pope be ſatisfied.</p>
                        <p>AT <hi>Nice</hi> were only examined the Proceſſion of the Holy Spirit, and the <hi>Azymes,</hi> other Differences were laid aſide. And as to what paſſed under <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Paleologus</hi> touching the Reunion of the two Churches, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets to put us in mind of that Violence, Deceit, and Tyranny which that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror uſed to accompliſh his Deſign, as we already obſerved, which was man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by Cruelty, Impriſonments, Puniſhments, and Baniſhments, and which drew on <hi>Michael</hi> ſuch a deadly Hatred from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that they refuſed him Burial after his Death; an Affair wherein after all he cheated the <hi>Greeks,</hi> in making them believe that each Church ſhould keep its Doctrines and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and that it ſignified nothing to amuſe the Pope with granting him his Supremacy, right of Appeals, and commemoration of him in their Liturgy.</p>
                        <p>AS to what concern'd the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> the Author of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity</hi> having already made uſe of it, I believ'd 'twas ſufficient to anſwer him that whatſoever paſſed in it, was a meere politick Intrigue, as well in reſpect of the <hi>Latins,</hi> as the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> and his Court acted therein with Violence, and the Greek Emperor mannaged his Buſineſs after a very timerous and intereſſed manner, and the Greek Biſhops bewrayed <note place="margin">Anſw. to the <hi>2d.</hi> Treatiſe. 2. <hi>p. c.</hi> 8.</note> a moſt pittiful Ignorance and Weakneſs, ſeveral of 'em being won by the <hi>Latins,</hi> the reſt ſigning the Act of Reunion without any Conſultation held firſt together, whence I conclude there muſt not be advantage taken hence, as if the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> were agreed in the Point of the ſubſtantial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:41961:164"/> under pretence it was not debated in that Council, and that the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe the <hi>Greeks</hi> upon their return into their own Country openly renounced this pretended Reunion.</p>
                        <p>BE my Anſwers never ſo reaſonable, yet do they not reliſh well with Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> wherefore it muſt not be expected he was ſatisfied with this. Much leſs inquire whether 'twas with or without a Preface, that he offered his new Objections; For 'twould be a kind of Miracle if he who reproaches me with my Prefaces, ſhould ſo much as once enter upon Examination of a thing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preparing the Readers by long Diſcourſes. <hi>Mr.</hi> Claude, ſay's he, here, <note place="margin">Lib. 4. c. 2. p. 333.</note> 
                           <hi>who can ſpeak when he pleaſes, Court Language in his Books of Divinity, pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproaches in the Preface of his Book the Author of the</hi> Perpetuity, <hi>that he decides Queſtions like a Soldier. I examine not at preſent whether he had Reaſon for his application of this Expreſſion, I reſerve this for the Diſcourſe wherein I deſign to treat of his perſonal Differences with this Author. But ſeeing he has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced this term in a ſerious Diſpute: I think I may borrow it of him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to expreſs after what ſort he gets clear of ſome conſiderable Difficulties, and touching which we may ſay with great reaſon, that never Man fought his way thro them more Soldier like than he did.</hi> And a little further; <hi>I cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a better Inſtance of Mr.</hi> Claude's <hi>Soldier like Humour, than the manner in which he treats of whatſoever paſſed in the Council of</hi> Florence.</p>
                        <p>IT ſufficiently appears Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> deſign'd to cenſure the uſe I made of the Term of Soldier-like, and the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> likewiſe Criticiz'd on another of my Expreſſions, <hi>viz. Fly in a mans Face.</hi> But if I may ſpeak my Thoughts of theſe Cenſures: It ſeems to me theſe kind of dealings become not Perſons, that profeſs a more profound Literature, and conſequently ſhould mind things, more than Words, not to ſay theſe Remarks are far Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the Subject we handle, and contribute little to the clearing up of our Queſtion. Moreover what have we to do with the Court, and its Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in our Diſpute. I pretend not to ſpeak the Language of the Court, my Condition and Profeſſion keeps me at ſuch a Diſtance from it, that I know not what Language is ſpoke there. I do not queſtion but they expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves politely and rationally, but paſſing my Life as I do out of the Palaces of great Perſonages, and far from the Honour of their Commerce, their ways of Expreſſing themſelves are unknown to me. I am not perhaps ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Love with the Age I live in, to leave my common Expreſſions, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate my ſelf to that of the Court. In ſhort, I pretend not to ſpeak ſo neatly, as to ſuppoſe my Style is without Fault. I leave to others the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of becoming Maſters of Language; to diſcredit received Expreſſions, and introduce new ones, whether juſtly or not, I refer my ſelf to others to judg, that underſtand them. In the mean time methinks Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſhould not ſo greatly find fault with this Term of <hi>Soldier-like,</hi> conſidering the uſe I made of it. <hi>I believed,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>I ought much leſs to make uſe of this new Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod which that Author has found out whereby to refute Mr.</hi> Aubertin'<hi>s Book, and in effect this is to do like</hi> Alexander, <hi>who cut the knot he could not untye, and to Diſpute Soldier like.</hi> This Term thus uſed in a Preface ſeemed ſupportable: Yet I am ſorry it has offended Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> if it be becauſe we made his Friend a common Soldier, let him conſider likewiſe, we repreſented him alſo as an <hi>Alexander.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT howſoever let's ſee whether my Anſwer concerning the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> is ſo Soldier like as he pretends. <hi>Policy,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>has its Bounds,</hi>
                           <pb n="297" facs="tcp:41961:164"/> 
                           <hi>it has not a part in every Affair, nor effects all things:</hi> Who doubts it? All that I attribute to the Effects of that Policy which reigned ſo much in that Council, was, that it obliged the <hi>Greeks</hi> to Reunite themſelves with the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,</hi> without a Pre examination of all the Differences between the two Churches, in hope each of 'em ſhould keep their own Doctrines, and ſuffer no Innovations. This was the ſame Policy <hi>Michael Paleologus</hi> inſpired his Biſhops with, as we already obſerved, and made them conſent to the Union at the Council of <hi>Lyons,</hi> under <hi>Gregory</hi> the X. Now this is called in my <hi>Dicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary,</hi> (for Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> tells me too of <hi>Dictionaries</hi> of my own making) this is called, I ſay, a plaſtered Union, an external Agreement which has no more than the Shadow and appearance of a Union, ſeeing that within there is a real Separation.</p>
                        <p>THE Judgment which ought to be made of my Anſwer, depends on two Queſtions, the firſt, whether in effect Policy had any ſhare in this Affair, or not: the ſecond, whether we may juſtly ſay that it ſo far prevail'd on the <hi>Greeks</hi> as to make 'em ſilent in the Point of Tranſubſtantiation, altho they did not believe it.</p>
                        <p>FOR the deciding of the firſt Queſtion, I deſire no other Perſon than Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> himſelf, <hi>'tis no great Myſtery,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>to tell us that in this Deſign of an</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid p. 337.</note> 
                           <hi>Union, touching the Differences which divided the</hi> Greeks <hi>from the</hi> Latins, <hi>there ſhould be politick Reſpects, and humane Intereſts; this is neither marvelous nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt.</hi> But whether Juſt, or Unjuſt, is not the Queſtion, it is ſufficient to me there were ſuch Reſpects in this Affair. <hi>The</hi> Turks, ſay's he likewiſe, <hi>made great Progreſſes, and reduced the Emperor to the greateſt Extremity.</hi> And a little lower, <hi>The Emperor choſe rather to treat with the Pope and Cardinals, as being more able to procure him that Aſſiſtance, he needed and hoped to obtain by means of the Union, than with the Council of</hi> Bale. Here then we have the Policy and Intereſt of the <hi>Greeks</hi> deſcribed. <hi>The Fathers of</hi> Bale, ſay's he moreover, <hi>were very deſirous to raiſe up the Dignity of their Council, by an Union with the</hi> Greeks, <hi>and therefore they made the moſt advantagious Offers they were able, to the Deputies of the Emperor</hi> John Paleologus Emanuel'<hi>s Son and Succeſſor. But</hi> Eugenus <hi>the</hi> IV <hi>intending to transfer the Council from</hi> Bale <hi>to</hi> Ferrara, <hi>he made uſe of the Reunion of the</hi> Greeks <hi>for a Pretence of this Tranſlation, and ſo orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it with the Greek Emperor, that he engaged him to ſend word he could not come to</hi> Bale. So that here we have again the political Intereſt of <hi>Eugenus</hi> and his Biſhops. We might here relate ſeveral matters touching the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble State of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and of the Negotiations of the Council of <hi>Bale,</hi> and of Pope <hi>Eugenus</hi> with the Emperor and Patriarch, touching the Reaſons why the Pope was preferred, and ſeveral other Circumſtances. But it is needleſs to prove a Point that is granted.</p>
                        <p>COME we then to the ſecond Queſtion, whether it may be truly ſaid that Policy ſo far prevail'd on the <hi>Greeks</hi> as to make 'em ſilent on the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, altho they did not believe it. For the clearing up of this Point, the Reader muſt here remember what I proved in the foregoing Chapter. 1. That there are two ſorts of different Opinions between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> ſome of which broke out into open Diſputes, and others not. 2. That altho the Doctrines of the two Churches touching the Change hap'ning in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> are in the main infinitely different, yet is their Difference concealed under a Vail of Expreſſions common to 'em both. On theſe two Principles I ſay we muſt not imagine there was made in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:41961:165"/> a general Diſcuſſion of all the Points wherein theſe two Churches differ'd, nor that the Union was carried on upon this Account. It was indeed at firſt the Sentiment of <hi>George Scholarius</hi> who told the Emperor, <hi>that to make a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and laſting Union, it was needful to examine all the Doctrines on both ſides,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Syrop. Hiſt. Concil. Flor. Sect. 3. c. 6.</note> 
                           <hi>without omitting any. But for the making of a politick temporary Union, the ſending of three or four Deputies was ſufficient, which would produce the ſame, if not a better Effect, and would be more beneficial to their Country, than if the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and his whole Clergy were preſent.</hi> This Advice was preſently liked of, but not taken. For there was neither mention in the Council of Chriſt's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent into Hell, the Salvation of the Damned, Apocryphal Books, nor of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Points but what had been openly controverted, and of them how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were paſſed over in Silence? There was no mention of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in both kind, altho the <hi>Greeks</hi> hold the neceſſity thereof, nor of the Prieſts Coelibacy, altho this had been formerly debated, nor uſe of carved Images, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> eſteem Idols, nor Miniſtry of Confirmation, which the <hi>Latins</hi> hold belongs only to the Biſhop, whereas the <hi>Greeks</hi> adminiſter it by their Prieſts, altho <hi>Photius</hi> made it a Cauſe of Separation. Neither was there any mention of the uſe of Blood, and Creatures ſtrangled, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> hold unlawful, altho <hi>Cerularius</hi> made it his chief Accuſation, nor of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Light which ſhined about the Body of our Saviour on Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> which the <hi>Greeks</hi> hold to be a Beam of God's eternal Light, nor ſeveral other Errors broached by <hi>Palamas</hi> which the <hi>Greeks</hi> have embraced, nor of the Pope's Power to grant Indulgencies, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> deride, nor of the three Immerſions they believe neceſſary in Baptiſm. There was only mention of the Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, the <hi>Azymes,</hi> Purgatory; the beatifical Viſion of the Saints, and papal Supremacy. And yet there were but two of theſe five Points diſcuſſed neither, namely that of Purgatory, and that of the Holy Spirit; the others paſſed into the Decree without Examination, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Acts of the ſame Council. And now would Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> make us believe that Policy could not ſo far prevail on the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as to make 'em ſilent in the Point of Tranſubſtantiation? It made 'em ſilent in Points expreſly ſet down in their Books, in others which were publickly controverted betwixt them and the <hi>Latins,</hi> and agitated in the time of their Separation, and yet it could not ſhut their Mouths, in Reference to an Article on which they ſaw nothing determin'd in their Church, neither for it, nor againſt it, on which neither they nor their Fathers had yet Diſputed, and of whoſe Importance they could not judg, being hindred by their Ignorance.</p>
                        <p>MOREOVER, had Tranſubſtantiation been propoſed to have been ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther approved or rejected, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Argument would have ſome Colour perhaps. I ſay perhaps, for after all, if their Policy was ſo prevalent as to make 'em ſign a Decree againſt their own Conſciences, wherein they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced their ancient Opinions touching the five Articles, and received thoſe of the <hi>Latins;</hi> who ſees not that it might as well obliged 'em to receive the Doctrine of the ſubſtantial Converſion? But howſoever they were not put upon to acknowledg it, and their Silence ſignifies no more on either part, but that both were quietly permitted to enjoy their own Opinions. We muſt not imagine they pretended to approve by Virtue of this Union all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the <hi>Latins,</hi> and there could be no more concluded thence at far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt, than a ſimple Toleration, as of other Points which were not diſcuſſed; Now if humane Intereſt was ſo powerful over the <hi>Greeks</hi> as to make 'em abjure their own Opinions, and embrace in appearance others, can it be thought ſtrange they ſhould paſs over in Silence an Article of that kind. It
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:41961:165"/> ſeems on the contrary that Zeal for their Religion, if they had any ſpark of it yet left, ſhould oblige 'em to reſtrain the Diſpute to a few Points, for they would loſe as many of 'em as they propoſed. The neceſſity of their Affairs forced them to make a Sacrifice of 'em to the <hi>Latins,</hi> ſo that all thoſe they could ſmother by their Silence, were as ſo many Points won, becauſe they were not loſt.</p>

That if they betrayed their Conſcience, it was thro humane Weakneſs, having firſt rendred to their Opinions all the Teſtimonies which could be expected from weak Perſons:</hi> But what could be alledged to leſs purpoſe? All this is true in reſpect of the Doctrines which they were forced to abandon, to ſubſcribe to contrary ones; but this ſignifies nothing to others they mention not, and which conſequently they were not obliged to receive, amongſt which that of Tranſubſtantiation was one, and moreover this Reſiſtance and Management he ſpeaks of, only appeared in the Doctrine of the <hi>Proceſſion,</hi> and not in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Points contained in the Decree, for they paſſed them over without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination and Diſcuſſion, except that of Purgatory, which was ſlightly regarded.</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſets himſelf to ſhow afterwards that the <hi>Latins</hi> did not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the <hi>Greeks</hi> held not Tranſubſtantiation; that they betrayed not their own Sentiments, nor were wilfully ignorant of thoſe of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> We ſhall hereafter conſider the Conduct of the <hi>Latins;</hi> But make we firſt an end of examining that of the <hi>Greeks. Does Mr.</hi> Claude, ſay's he, <hi>know what he ſay's when he makes ſuch unreaſonable Suppoſitions? Does he conſider into what abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities he plunges himſelf. Or will he pretend the</hi> Greeks <hi>agreed amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before they parted from</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>to conceal their Opinions on this Point from the</hi> Latins, <hi>and carried on this Deſign ſo dexterouſly, that amongſt ſo many</hi> Greeks <hi>there were not one of them that diſcovered this Secret to the</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins? There are certainly judicious Perſons enough ſtill in the World to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine which of us two ſeems to conſider moſt what he ſay's. I do not pretend that either the <hi>Greeks</hi> plotted together at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> or that they carried it ſo cloſely at <hi>Florence,</hi> but that the <hi>Latins</hi> might know (if they would) what was their Belief touching the <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> Their Books ſpeak their Minds. Theſe Complots and Conſpirations are Phantaſms which appear to Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> in the heat of his Study. I pretend no more than what is true, to wit, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> paſſed over in Silence ſeveral Articles on which they had not the ſame Sentiments as the <hi>Latins,</hi> and I believe Tranſubſtantiation was one of them. If Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> pretends the contrary, it lies upon him to produce his Reaſons. Let him tell us what Complot there could be between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> in reference to their Silence in ſo many other Points, which were not diſcuſſed. Let him tell us at leaſt why in the Acts of the Council, and other Writings, wherein is mentioned the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> when the <hi>Latins</hi> ſay, <hi>Tranſubſtantiate,</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> on the contrary ſay only <hi>Conſecrate</hi> and <hi>Sanctify.</hi> Wherefore in the Decretal of the Union, whether we read it in Latin or Greek, we find no mention there of the ſubſtantial Converſion.

                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> takes a great deal of Pains to prove the <hi>Latins</hi> could not be Ignorant of the Sentiment of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> nor the <hi>Greeks</hi> of the <hi>Latins;</hi> But to no purpoſe. It ſignifies nothing to me whether they did, or did not know one anothers Opinions. We will ſuppoſe if he will, they made this their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Study, but then what ſignifies this to our Queſtion? I am ſatisfi'd they were reunited without any formal Declaration of their Agreement in this Point, for as it cannot be concluded from their Silence on other Points, that there were no difference betwixt them, ſo is it the ſame concerning Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation.

                        <p>I am ſo far from excuſing this Action, that I believe it is on the contrary inexcuſable both before God and Men; But how great ſoever their Fault was in aſſiſting at the Service of the <hi>Latins,</hi> which they ſo greatly abhorred, it appears that what they did, was not to teſtify they believed the ſame things as they, but that the Union after a ſort was accompliſhed. For they were preſent at their Service, only in hope the <hi>Latins</hi> would likewiſe aſſiſt at theirs, and in effect the Emperor was very urgent with the Pope for this.

Whereupon the Emperor finding himſelf abuſed, thus expreſſed <note place="margin">Sect. 10. c. 11.</note> himſelf. <hi>We hoped the</hi> Latins <hi>would have amended ſeveral Errors, but I find them not only Innovators and Blame worthy in ſeveral things, but that which is worſe, they take upon them to reform us.</hi> It is worth while to obſerve what kind of Union this was, which being perfected, the Pope declares on his ſide, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he nor his <hi>Latins</hi> had conſidered the Liturgy of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror on the other hand, proteſts the <hi>Latins</hi> are Innovators, and guilty of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Errors.</p>

Why diſcovering to us as he does, his Countrymens weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; he mentions not one word concerning that which ought to be the chief Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his Hiſtory?

Why did he not deplore the Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe of his Nation, that were preſent at the Popiſh Maſs, who ſhewed it the ſame Reſpect as the</hi> Latins, <hi>which is to ſay, adored the</hi> Euchariſt. To all theſe <hi>Wherefores,</hi> I ſhall oppoſe others: Why didnot <hi>Syropulus</hi> take notice of the Silence of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> on the Article touching the Salvation of the Damned, and Chriſt's deſcent into Hell, and offering them his Goſpel? Why did he not cenſure the Neglect of both one and th'other, in that they mentioned not a word concerning the Marriage of Prieſts, nor communion under both kinds, nor of all thoſe other Articles I denoted in this Chapter? Theſe kind of Queſtions which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> makes, are good for nothing but to impoſe on inconſiderate Perſons? <hi>Syropulus</hi> is an Hiſtorian that contents himſelf with relating what paſſed of moment in this Affair, and ſometimes to give his Opinion in general thereupon; but it plainly appears he never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to reflect on every Particular wherein his Nation was concern'd. A Hiſtory is not a Diſpute: Wherefore then ſhould he Diſcourſe of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation in it? Why blame the Ceremonies of the <hi>Latins,</hi> or deteſt the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Sacrament, and its Feaſt? Why tell us of the Adoration which the <hi>Greeks</hi> rendered to the Hoſt of the <hi>Latins,</hi> ſeeing he aſſures us on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>that they ſtood bolt upright during the Liturgy?</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> who calls upon others ſo much, to think upon what they write; has he I ſay, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what he ſaies concerning the Feaſt of the Holy Sacrament? <hi>Wherefore,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>has not</hi> Syropulus <hi>deteſted the Feaſt of the Holy Sacrament, of which he was a Witneſs?</hi> For I ſhall only tell him: He has not mentioned a word of it, and yet 'tis certain the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not approve it, but on the contrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it, as I already ſhow'd in the foregoing Book. It does not then follow the <hi>Greeks</hi> hold Tranſubſtantiation, altho <hi>Syropulus</hi> ſpeaks not of it.</p>
                        <p>AND thus much concerning the Council of <hi>Florence.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:41961:167"/> draws ſome Arguments from what paſſed after the <hi>Greeks</hi> had renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced this Union. And firſt he takes for granted, that Tranſubſtantiation was eſtabliſhed in this Council, and that the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſolemnly approved of it. On this Principle he runs on arguing beyond all bounds, that thoſe that violated the Union, ſhould inveigh againſt this Doctrine of the <hi>Latins,</hi> and thoſe that approved it. He introduces again <hi>Syropulus,</hi> and alledges <hi>Marc</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and deſcribes his Hatred againſt the <hi>Latins:</hi> He tells us of a Synod held at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> againſt the Patriarch <hi>Metrophanus,</hi> and thoſe of his Party. <hi>This was the time,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>if ever, to reproach thoſe with Tranſubſtantiation that had conſented to the Union, and approved this Doctrine in it.</hi> He takes Occaſion <note place="margin">Lib. 4. c. 3. p. 355.</note> hence to bleſs God the <hi>Greeks</hi> had renounced this Union, acknowledging the Divine Providence therein, which permitted it thus to come to paſs, to the end he might not want matter for his Book. <hi>Whatſoever we related,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>touching the</hi> Greeks <hi>approbation of Tranſubſtantiation would have leſs force, had</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Pag. 347.</note> 
                           <hi>this Agreement ſubſiſted. It would have been alledged that politick Intereſt having made the</hi> Greeks <hi>conſent to the receiving of this Doctrine, they were afterwards withheld by Fear from condemning it, and being inſenſibly accuſtomed to it, dared not immediately reject it, by reaſon of the bad eſtate of their Affairs. But to the end their real Belief might appear in this Subject, it was neceſſary this Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be diſturbed, and their Paſſion at liberty to break out, that they ſhould indeavour to make void whatſoever they had confirmed at</hi> Florence: <hi>That they ſhould attack the Union in all poſſible manners, and denote whatſoever they could gainſay, reproachfully charge and caluminate the</hi> Latins <hi>with whom they had treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the</hi> Greeks <hi>who had conſented to the Union, that their Hatred and Rage ſhould diſcover it ſelf-without Diſguiſe and Conſtraint.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>ADMIRE I beſeech you this flight of Fancy, and vaſt extent of Thought. The Good and Evil which befel the Chriſtian World two hundred Years ago, appears deſign'd for the Glory of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Book, with this only Difference, that the Evils contribute to it more than the Good; for 'tis the Schiſm, Paſſion, Hatred, and Rage of the <hi>Greeks</hi> which give him a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Victory. <hi>It was neceſſary,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>they ſhould be thus furious,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, it was neceſſary half of the World ſhould be damned, according to him, that God ſhould be diſhonoured by a thouſand Crimes, and his Church torn to pieces by a dreadful Diviſion. And why? For to furniſh Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> with an Argument, and that he might have Matter for one Chapter more.</p>
                        <p>BUT he will be much amazed to find this Argument ſo dear bought, to conclude nothing, being grounded on a falſe Suppoſition. For 'tis falſe the <hi>Greeks</hi> approved Tranſubſtantiation in the Council of <hi>Florence:</hi> That they Diſputed not of it, I acknowledg, but that they approved it I deny. <hi>Beſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi> ſpeaking in their Name, ſay's, <hi>that the Bread is Conſecrated, and made the Body of Christ;</hi> and the Decree bears, <hi>that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is truly Conſecrated: Therefore they approved Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> What a Conſequence here is? Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has a Secret above my Apprehenſion, for he can change the very Nature of things, he can diminiſh and augment them as he pleaſes. But the Miſery on it is, this appears contrary to Reaſon. Why will he have the new Schiſm of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> to have hapned meerly for the furniſhing him with an Argument? It was not known in thoſe days he was to make a Book. Why will he have the <hi>Greeks</hi> approve Tranſubſtantiation at <hi>Florence?</hi> See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there was not the leaſt mention of it? Why muſt thoſe that broke the Union, reproach the others with approving the Doctrine of the <hi>Latins?</hi>
                           <pb n="303" facs="tcp:41961:167"/> Why will he have <hi>Syropulus, Marc</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and the Council of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> to declaim on this Point, ſeeing they had no reaſon to do ſo. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch groſs Illuſions as theſe, deſerved not ſuch Exclamations.</p>
                        <p>IT only remains for the finiſhing of this Chapter, and this matter of Ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gative Arguments, to ſhow a Reaſon for the Silence of the <hi>Latins,</hi> and that will be no hard matter to do. The <hi>Latins</hi> have innovated in the Doctrine of the <hi>Euchariſt:</hi> They have grounded their Innovations on certain Expreſſions of the Fathers, which bear that the Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, that it is changed into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. They have made it their Buſineſs for ſome Ages, to make the World believe theſe Terms ſignify a true and real Converſion of the Subſtance of Bread, into that of the Body of Chriſt, to defend themſelves by this means from the Reproach of Innovation. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving then that the <hi>Greeks</hi> do commonly uſe theſe kind of Expreſſions, and even added to 'em ſome others which ſeem more emphatical; as for Inſtance, that the Bread is not a Figure, that it is the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and that the Body born of the Virgin, and the Bread, are not two things, but one and the ſame; they well knew it was their Intereſt to reſt ſatisfied with theſe general Expreſſions, altho in effect they ſignify nothing leſs than Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation. Had they condemned them as inſufficient, and urged the <hi>Greeks</hi> to admit of theirs, they would at the ſame time condemned themſelves as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novators. They choſe then rather to paſs over ſoftly this Article, than to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture near a Rock againſt which their Cauſe ran a risk of being daſhed to pieces. And this obliged them in their Dealings with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> to content themſelves with their Expreſſions, and accommodate themſelves to 'em, that they might not move 'em, as appears by the Formulary of the Reunions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned, and Decree of the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> wherein was uſed only the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <p>YET we muſt not imagine but that judicious Perſons amongſt the <hi>Latins,</hi> and eſpecially thoſe that had the Government in their Hands, ſaw well enough the Difference, between theſe general Expreſſions of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and determinate ones of the Roman Church. That learned Man I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the ſeventh Chapter of the foregoing Book, (who was conſulted on the Articles which the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> in <hi>Poland,</hi> propoſed in order to their Reunion with the Roman Church, amongſt which was this, that they ſhould not be obliged to Celebrate <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> Feaſt, nor carry about the Sacrament in Proceſſion) anſwered, <hi>That as to what concern'd the Proceſſion, it was not a</hi>

                           <hi>matter to ſtick at, but there were things of greater Importance to be conſidered touching the Sacrament. De proceſſione infeſto corporis non laborarem, multa ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men circa hoc Sacramentum examinanda ſunt.</hi> And therefore when particular Perſons amongſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> imbrace the Roman Religion, the uſual terms of their Church are not counted ſufficient, but they are made to underſtand di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly the ſubſtantial Converſion, and to receive the term of Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, as we already offered in the Proceſſion of Faith they are obliged to make. Hence proceed all thoſe Efforts ſince ſo long a time, to introduce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly amongſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> this Belief, by means of falſe <hi>Greeks,</hi> as appears by the Example of that Monk mentioned by Mr. <hi>Baſire,</hi> who had ſlily inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated the word <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:41961:168"/> from that of the real <hi>Greeks,</hi> as appears by the Example of the great <hi>Payſius Ligaridius,</hi> and the terrible Baron of <hi>Spartaris.</hi> And this is evident in the <hi>Greeks</hi> that imbrace the Romiſh Religion, for they ſpeak not as others, nor as they did themſelves before their Converſion, as I already inſtanced in <hi>Beſſarion, Emanuel Calecas,</hi> and <hi>John Pluſiadene.</hi>

                           <hi>warily and moderately handled: Neither muſt a Man mention any of theſe five Articles which were heretofore the principal ones, and which the Synod of</hi> Florence <hi>and</hi> Gennadius <hi>handled. For now the Controverſies of the</hi> Azyme <hi>and</hi> Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt <hi>are no longer agitated, neither in</hi> Candia, <hi>nor any other of the Eaſtern Parts. And therefore theſe Points cannot again be received, without giving juſt Offence. As to the Article of the Proceſſion of the Holy Spirit, there are few that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, and ſhould it again be controverted, 'tis likely 'twould happen that thoſe who were ignorant of it before, would after Inquiry into that, paſs over to other things.</hi>

                        <p>THE <hi>Latins</hi> greateſt Intereſt then, conſiſts in two things; the firſt, to ſubject the <hi>Greeks</hi> by any means to the Roman See; and th'other, inſenſibly to change the ancient from of their Religion, and ſlily introduce amongſt them the Doctrines and Rites of the Latin Church. To accompliſh the firſt of theſe, the <hi>Latins</hi> act and yield every thing as far as the Honour of their Church will permit them, and according as they find fewer or more Difficulties. Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> himſelf has diſcovered ſomething of this, when he told us that in the Council of <hi>Constantinople</hi> held under <hi>Emanuel Comnenus, The</hi> Latins <hi>only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 2. c. 11. p. 910.</note> 
                           <hi>of the</hi> Greeks <hi>that they ſhould mention the Pope's Name in their publick Prayers, acknowledg his Supremacy, and the right of Appeals to him;</hi> the reſt at that time being not regarded. We have likewiſe ſeen that <hi>Michael Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologus</hi> perſwaded his Biſhops to Imbrace the Union, ſeeing there were no more required of them than theſe three Points. Yet the Article touching the Holy Spirit, was ſo ancient and famous a Difference between them, that 'twas a hard matter to reunite therein, and take no notice of it, and we find the <hi>Greeks</hi> themſelves mentioned it, becauſe it had been one of the chief Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of their Separation. The <hi>Latins</hi> then not being able to paſs over this Point in Silence, offered the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſometimes, that provided they received this Doctrine in their Belief, that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, they might keep their Symbol as it was, without expreſly adding the <hi>Filioque.</hi> And this the Popes Legats who were at <hi>Nice</hi> after the taking of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> told them as from him, according to Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Relation. <note place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>The Pope,</hi> ſay they, <hi>will not conſtrain the</hi> Greeks <hi>to add this Clauſe expreſly in the Symbol, when they ſhall ſing it in the Church.</hi> And it was upon this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that the Reunion was made in the Council of <hi>Florence:</hi> But when the <hi>Latins</hi> ſaw a more favourable Occaſion, they extended their Pretenſions far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and changed their Cuſtom, as will appear by what I am now going to ſay. <hi>Nicholas</hi> the III ſent Legats into <hi>Greece</hi> to the Emperor <hi>Michael Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologus</hi> to ſolicit him, to oblige his Patriarch and Prelates to make their Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith, which they had not yet made, and renounce their Schiſm. The Emperor earneſtly beſought the Pope to leave the Symbol untouched, and not oblige the <hi>Greeks</hi> to ſing it with the addition of the <hi>Filioque,</hi> to prevent all Tumults: But <hi>Michael</hi> being known to be a Prince devoted, (for his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt)
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:41961:168"/> to the Roman Church, and therefore might be eaſily prevailed on, the Pope gave order to his Legats to anſwer him touching this Article, as follows. <hi>That the Unity of the Catholick Faith permits not Diverſity in its Confeſſions, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Act of Profeſſion, or in the Chaunt, or any particular Declaration of</hi>

                        <p>AS to the ſecond Intereſt, which conſiſts in changing inſenſibly the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and ſlily inſinuating the Doctrine and Rites of the Roman Church in its ſtead, it appears from the Courſe they take, that this is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the <hi>Latins.</hi> It is for this purpoſe that Seminaries have been ſet up at <hi>Rome,</hi> and other places, and the whole <hi>Eaſt</hi> long ſince oreſpread with Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. It is in order to this, that the Emiſſaries apply themſelves to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of the Greek Biſhops, and inſtructing of Youth in the Roman Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, under pretence of teaching them the Tongues and Philoſophy. And 'tis for this end likewiſe, that the Scholars of the Seminaries are entertained and ſent into <hi>Greece;</hi> they have the Liberty to receive Orders from the Hands of ſchiſmatical Biſhops, and the Biſhopricks are indeavoured to be filled with them, and they are ſometimes promoted to Patriarchates. It is clear that in taking this Courſe, they have no need to diſpute it out with 'em.</p>
                        <p>IT will not, I ſuppoſe be amiſs to obſerve here what <hi>Thomas a Jeſu</hi> (who wrote a Book touching the means for the Converting of Infidels, Hereticks, and Schiſmaticks) tells us, is the ready way to convert all <hi>Greece</hi> to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith. <hi>His Holineſs,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>who is ſo vigilant for the Salvation of Souls,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 6. c. 4.</note> 
                           <hi>muſt take care, that as ſoon as ever the Patriarchal Church of</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes void, to pitch upon one of the Scholars of the Seminaries, or Monks who have taken upon them Eccleſiaſtical Charges in</hi> Grece. <hi>He muſt chooſe one whom he thinks moſt fitting, and give him notice thereof, but as privately as may be, leſt the</hi> Greeks <hi>come to know 'tis he that gives him the Patriarchal Church of</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, <hi>Elects and Confirms him Patriarch. For this effect his Holyneſs muſt order him to betake himſelf to</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>where he will find Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors already prepared by his Holyneſs, who by the Preſents they ſhall make the Turk, (on whom the Election and Confirmation of the Patriarch depends, altho unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,) will obtain, by adding ſomething to the uſual Tribute, that he command the</hi> Greeks <hi>to chooſe for their Patriarch, him whom his Holineſs ſhall deſign. They will no ſooner demand this, than obtain it; for Mony will make the Tyrant do any thing, as appears by the little Difficulty he makes of taking away the Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Dignity from thoſe that have it already. Moreover there ought to be no ſcruple made of this, as if it were a kind of Simony: For this is not a ſetting the Patriarchate upon Sale, ſeeing his Holyneſs has already given it, Money is only made uſe of to remove ſome Difficulties. Now Divines are unanimous in their Opinions, that we may free our ſelves from Vexations and Obſtructions, by means of Money. Neither can it be alledged that hereby the Metropolitains</hi>
                           <pb n="306" facs="tcp:41961:169"/> 
                           <hi>will be deprived of their right of Election; for 'tis clear their Elections are inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, being as they are Schiſmaticks, and conſequently have have no Juriſdiction: Moreover it ſeems to be rather the Turk that makes the Election, than they, for they Conſecrate him whom he Preſents. So that here will this Advantage redound from this aforementioned Election. 1ſt. That as faſt as the Schiſmatical Biſhops dye, the Scholars of the Seminary, or others, of whoſe Judgment there is no cauſe to doubt, will take their places. 2d.</hi> The Reformation of the Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks may be happily undertaken and effected in particular Synods. <hi>But his Holyneſs muſt never deſpair nor be weary, or think it ſufficient that he has elected one Patriarch. He muſt on the contrary ſubſtitute another again and again, ever putting Scholars of the Seminary into the places of the Deceaſed, until all the old Schiſmatical Prelates be dead, and their places filled with Catholicks. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Election of Patriarchs of</hi> Alexandria <hi>and</hi> Antioch <hi>depend likewiſe on the Turk, becauſe they are</hi> Greeks; <hi>and that the Government of theſe Churches is in the Hands of</hi> Greeks, <hi>the ſame Meaſures muſt be taken in reſpect of them, by means of Ambaſſadors. It is certain that this Affair will be ſucceſsful, for Money does all things in this Country. So that all the Patriarchs being Roman Catholick, and their Duty obliging them to eſtabliſh Catholick Biſhops and Curats according as their Wiſdom ſhall direct them; nothing will hinder us from ſaying in a ſhort time, behold one Flock, and one only Shepherd. The Schiſmatical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates will be rooted out, and thoſe who from their Infancy have been piouſly brought up in the Boſom of the Catholick Church, will take their places. Theſe new Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates by the uprightneſs of their Lives, and ſoundneſs of their Doctrine, may go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern a People who are only Erroneous upon the account of their natural Facility and Proneneſs to believe what their Biſhops tell them.</hi> And this is the Courſe <hi>Thomas a Jeſu</hi> would have taken, and not that of Diſputes and Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies.</p>

                        <p>FIRST, <hi>Theophylact, Euthymius, Cabaſilus,</hi> and <hi>Jeremias,</hi> aſſure us that the Bread of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is not an <hi>Antitype,</hi> that is to ſay a Figure, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, but <hi>the very Body it ſelf of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> becauſe he did not ſay, <hi>this is the Antitype,</hi> but <hi>this is my Body.</hi> I grant all this, and I joyn all theſe four Authors together on this Head, that I may thereby avoid Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity, who having propoſed them one after another, could not avoid the oft repeating of the ſame Inductions and Arguments: One Anſwer ſhall ſerve for all. <hi>Theophylact,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>keeps to the propriety of Words, he excludes</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 2. c. 9. p. 180.</note> 
                           <hi>whatſoever varies from 'em: He overthrows and abſolutely rejects all metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Significations, and keeps cloſe to the literal Signification of the Word EST.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">C. 12. p. 215.</note> Euthymius, ſay's he, <hi>excludes the Key of Figure, and plainly ſhows he has not taken the Word EST in the Sence of SIGNIFICAT. He has then taken it in a Sence of Reality.</hi> From whence he concludes that theſe Authors could not mean that the Bread is the Body of Chriſt in <hi>Virtue,</hi> ſeeing they would argue contrary to their Intention; <hi>For as our Saviour ſaid not, This is the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, nor that the Bread he would give ſhould be the Figure; ſo neither has he ſaid, that he would give the Virtue of his Fleſh, or that the Bread he would give, ſhould contain the Virtue of his Fleſh.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I anſwer, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> need not trouble himſelf with ſhewing us that the <hi>Greeks</hi> admit not the figurative Sence in our Saviour's Words, neither take the Term <hi>EST</hi> in the Sence of <hi>SIGNIFICAT.</hi> We grant it him: And we grant likewiſe that we agree not with them in this. But the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here is to know, whether it thence follows they believe Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation. Now I maintain that not only this does not follow, but that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary does; for they hold a kind of middle way between the Sence of Figure and that of Tranſubſtantiation. In a word, they believe that the Bread re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Bread (as to its Subſtance) is yet the proper Body of Chriſt, by Augmentation of the natural Body, as we already ſhewed in the laſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the foregoing Book. What does Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> deſire more? Would he have us ſhew, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> believe the Bread is made the Body of Chriſt by this means, in the ſame manner the Food we eat becomes our Body? They ſay ſo in expreſs terms. Would he have us ſhew him, that by this means, the Subſtance of Bread loſes not its Exiſtence, nor is changed into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Subſtance of the Body that 'twas before? The thing it ſelf ſpeaks as much, and we have ſhewed it in its place, as clearly as a thing of this Nature can be ſhew'd. Does he doubt that the <hi>Greeks</hi> believe by this means, to keep the preciſe and literal Sence of our Saviour's Words? They do themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that they underſtand them no otherwiſe. Would he have this, in fine, to be but a bad way of keeping the literal Sence? The <hi>Greeks</hi> maintain the contrary, and alledg for this Effect the Inſtance of Food which is made one with our Body, by this ſame way of Aſſimulation and Augmentation, and that it cannot be ſaid theſe are two Bodies, but one and the ſame Body.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>BUT as,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>our Saviour ſaid not, this is the Figure, ſo neither did he ſay, this is the Virtue of my Body, but this is my Body. 1ſt.</hi> This is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute againſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and not againſt us, who never undertook to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the Truth of their Opinions. <hi>2d.</hi> They will anſwer him this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Virtue is ſufficient to make the Bread our Lord's Body without a Figure, and there is no need of a change of Subſtance, becauſe the Subſtance of Food is not preciſely changed into that which we have already, but only added to it, to make a Growth, or Augmentation, yet becomes our
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:41961:170"/> Body in a proper and literal Sence, not a Figure, but our Body it ſelf, not another Body, but the ſame we had before. Beſides they will affirm that the Sence of the Roman Church is not a literal Sence: For the literal Sence of our Saviour's Words muſt retain two things. Firſt, that 'tis Bread, and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that 'tis the Body of Chriſt, which Tranſubſtantiation does not.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>BUT,</hi> ſay's Mr. <hi>Arnaud, Baptiſm contains the Virtue of Chriſt's Blood, and yet we do not ſay, Baptiſm is not the Figure of it, but the Blood it ſelf of Chriſt.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 2. c. 9. p. 179.</note> I anſwer, that this is ſtill to diſpute againſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and not againſt me. For ſuppoſing it were more true than it is, that the Water of Baptiſm is not mentioned, like as the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſpeak of the Bread in the <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> yet ſtill theſe two things are certain; Firſt, that they affirm the Bread to be the Body of Chriſt by this Impreſſion of Virtue; and ſecondly, that 'tis thus they Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Words, This is my Body. <hi>Ely de Crete having told us that God</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Comment. in Orat. 1. Greg. Naz.</note> 
                           <hi>changes the Oblations, into the Efficacy of his Fleſh.</hi> Immediately adds, <hi>and doubt not of the Truth of this, ſeeing he himſelf plainly ſay's, this is my Body, this is my Blood.</hi> It is apparent he grounds this change of the Bread into the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of Fleſh, on the expreſs Words of our Saviour; Whence it follows that 'tis thus he underſtands them. <hi>Cyrillus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> having likewiſe ſaid in the ſame manner, <hi>that God changes the Oblations into the Efficacy of his</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Cyrill. apud Victor. Ante MS. in Bibl. Reg.</note> 
                           <hi>Fleſh,</hi> adds, <hi>that we muſt not doubt of the Truth of this, ſeeing he has ſaid it,</hi> which evidently ſhews that according to him, theſe Words, <hi>this is my Body,</hi> ſignifies no more, than that this has the Efficacy of my Body, or is my Body in Efficacy. Yet ſhould we take upon us to reply in behalf of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> to the Inſtance or Example Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> alledges touching Baptiſm; We might tell him that the Reaſon why they expreſs not themſelves in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in reference to the Water, as they do to the Bread, is becauſe our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our never ſaid of it, this is my Blood, as he ſaid of the Bread, this is my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and that the Holy Scripture having differently explained it ſelf touching Baptiſm, and the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> we muſt not think it ſtrange, if Divines have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed themſelves about them in a different manner. He may be moreover anſwered, that the ſame <hi>Oeconomy</hi> obſerved touching the Body and Blood of Chriſt, is not obſerved in the Water of Baptiſm, as it is obſerved in the Bread and Wine in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> and therefore it cannot be ſo well ſaid that the Water becomes the Blood by this way of Growth and Augmentation, as may be ſaid of the Bread, altho it receives the Impreſſion of the Virtue of Blood.</p>
                        <p>AS to what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> adds that the Miniſters acknowledg theſe Words, <hi>this is my Body,</hi> muſt be either underſtood in a real, or figurative Sence, whence it follows according to him, that <hi>Theophylact</hi> underſtood them in one or the other of theſe. I ſay this Reaſoning is falſe, as well in its Principle, as Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: For the Miniſters do not acknowledg either that we ought, or can underſtand theſe Words, in this Sence of Reality the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> gives them. We all hold that this is an abſurd and impoſſible Sence, and that none but a figurative one can ſubſiſt. But ſuppoſing the Miniſters ſhould ſay what he makes them, why would he have us regulate thereby the Sence of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylact</hi> and other <hi>Greeks.</hi> They have argued on their own Hypotheſis, and not on that of the Miniſters: Whether their Hypotheſis be juſtifiable, or not, is not to be diſputed with the Miniſters, for Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> was never yet told that the <hi>Greeks</hi> were agreed in all things with us. It is ſufficient that on one hand, he be ſhewed in what manner the <hi>Greeks</hi> pretend the proper Sence of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Words is obſerved, and on the other, that this manner, whatſoever it
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:41961:170"/> be, Good, or Bad, Juſtifiable, or Unjuſtifiable, Conformable, or not Conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to what the Miniſters ſay, is directly oppoſite to Tranſubſtantiation, for our only Queſtion is, Whether the <hi>Greeks</hi> believe Tranſubſtantiation or not.</p>
                        <p>THIS is then a mere Illuſion to explain <hi>Theophylact</hi> by what the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſay or not ſay, and it is yet a greater, to tell us as if it were a thing ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly Diſputed between him and us, that <hi>Euthymius excludes the Key of Figure, and does not take the Word EST in the Sence of</hi> Significat; <hi>that 'tis not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we would borrow</hi> Euthymius <hi>his Words to inſtruct a Man in our Opinion, and</hi>

                           <hi>that we are not wont to ſay, that Chriſt gave us not the Figure of his Body, but his Body, becauſe he ſaid, this is my Body.</hi> And thus do Men argue that impoſe on the World, which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> never fails of doing.</p>
                        <p>HAVING produced theſe Arguments, which in my Mind have not proved very ſucceſsful to him, he offers us others, drawn from the Doubts or Difficulties, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> propoſe to themſelves, as ariſing from their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, and which they endeavour to reſolve in the beſt manner they can. <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophylact,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>teſtifies there ariſes naturally a Doubt from what Faith teaches concerning this Myſtery, that the Bread is really the Fleſh of Chriſt, which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 2. c. 9. p. 183.</note> 
                           <hi>he expreſſes in theſe Words.</hi> Quomodo, inquit, neque enim caro videtur; <hi>How can this be? For this Bread does not ſeem to me to be Fleſh: Whence he obſerves the natural Conſequence of this Change muſt be, that the Bread being Fleſh muſt appear to be ſo, and ſeeing it does not, 'tis aſtoniſhing.</hi> Et quomodo, inquit aliquis, non apparet caro ſed Panis? <hi>Now,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>let a man take</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertin's, <hi>or Mr.</hi> Claude's <hi>Gloſs, to expound</hi> Theophylact, <hi>and we ſhall find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more Extravagant. For this is as much as to ſay according to them, if it be true the Bread contains the Virtue of Chriſt's Body, how comes it to paſs, that it does not appear to us to be Fleſh? Whence is it we ſee only Bread and not Fleſh? Is it not ridiculous to make People reaſon after ſo abſurd a manner. And why muſt this Bread containing only the Virtue of Chriſt's Body appear Fleſh, when it is not ſo? Does it follow from the Breads partaking of a ſpiritual Quality of the Fleſh of Chriſt, either morally or phyſically, that it muſt appear Fleſh? Would it not be on the contrary a dreadful Prodigy, if the Fleſh of Chriſt being only in Virtue in the Bread of the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>ſhould appear Fleſh.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>AND this is Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Reaſoning, ſet forth with its uſual Sweetneſs, that is to ſay, of <hi>Extravagancies</hi> and <hi>Abſurdities,</hi> with which he charges both me and Mr. <hi>Aubertin.</hi> I anſwer he is under a Miſtake, and ſuch a kind of Miſtake too, wherein his Reputation is deeply concern'd; for he takes for the Ground of <hi>Theophylact</hi>'s Doubt, that which is on the contrary the Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, as will appear by what follows. Now a Man cannot fall into a greater Error, than to take for the cauſe of a Doubt, that which is the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution thereof, and which makes the Doubt ceaſe. To Diſpel then this vain Shadow, under which he has diſguiſed the Paſſage of <hi>Theophylact,</hi> we need only examine the ſeveral Parts of this Author's Diſcourſe, and ſhow their mutual Dependence. Immediately treating on the Words of Chriſt, he rejects the Sence of Figure. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſay's he, in his Commentary on St. <note place="margin">Comm. in Mat. c. 26.</note> 
                           <hi>Mathew, by theſe Words, this is my Body, ſhows us that the Bread which is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated on the Altar, is the Lord's own Body, and not an Antitype. For he did not ſay, This is the Antitype, but, this is my Body, this Bread being changed by an ineffable Operation, altho it appears to us to be ſtill Bread.</hi> He ſay's the ſame thing on the ſixth Chapter of St. <hi>John,</hi> and the fourteenth of St. <hi>Marc.</hi> So far he aſſerts that the Bread is the Body it ſelf, and Fleſh of Chriſt; but he
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:41961:171"/> does not explain after what manner it is ſo. Now becauſe from this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thus generally conceived, and not explained, there may ariſe two diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; one, how the ſame thing can be Bread and Fleſh; th'other, how it does not appear to us to be Fleſh, but Bread; <hi>Theophylact</hi> propoſes 'em both, <note place="margin">Com. in. Joan.</note> and reſolves 'em. He propoſes the firſt in theſe Terms: <hi>The Bread is changed into our Lord's Fleſh by myſtical Words, by the myſtical Bleſſing, and coming of the Holy Spirit: And let no body be troubled that he muſt believe the Bread is Fleſh.</hi> He reſolves it by the Example of the Bread which Chriſt eat, and which was changed into his Body, and became like unto his Fleſh in augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, and nouriſhing it. <hi>The Lord,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>when as yet in the World, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                           <hi>his Nouriſhment from Bread, this Bread he took, was changed into his Body, and became like unto his Fleſh, and contributed to augment and ſuſtain it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a natural manner, ſo in like ſort this Bread is now changed into our Lord's Fleſh.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IT is plain, this Anſwer ſuppoſes that the Bread is made the Body of Chriſt by way of Augmentation, and by a kind of Aſſimulation, as the Bread which he eat whilſt on earth, became his Body. Now firſt we ſee that this is not the Romane Tranſubſtantiation: The ſubſtance of Bread which the Lord eat, was not changed into the ſame Subſtance which he had before, it was joyned unto it, and made like it: But moreover what relation has this with the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty which <hi>Theophylact</hi> propoſed to himſelf? Is it not evident that it muſt be ſolved after another manner, ſuppoſing he believed Tranſubſtantiation. For it muſt be ſaid that the Bread is not Fleſh, but only as it is really and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially converted into the ſame Subſtance of this Fleſh. The Romiſh Hypotheſis would unavoidably lead him to this; but inſtead of this, he anſwers by an Example wherein Tranſubſtantiation is not concern'd, and this ſhows clearly that he had not this Tranſubſtantiation in his Thoughts.</p>
                        <p>AS to the ſecond Difficulty, which conſiſts in that if the Bread were Fleſh, it would appear Fleſh, as it may equally ſpring both from the Solution which he came from giving to the firſt Doubt, to wit, the Compariſon of the Bread which Chriſt eat, which was changed into his Fleſh; and from the general Propoſition he eſtabliſhed in the beginning, to wit, that the Bread is the Fleſh and the Body it ſelf of Jeſus Chriſt, not his Image; he conſiders it likewiſe as coming from both one and the other of theſe two Principles. He propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it in his Commentaries on St. <hi>John,</hi> as ariſing from the Solution he had given it: For having related this Compariſon of the Bread Chriſt eat, which became his Body, he adds, <hi>how then can it be ſaid? Why does it appear to us to be Bread, and not Fleſh.</hi> In effect, if it be the ſame with the Bread of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,</hi> as that which Chriſt eat, it ſeems it ought appear to us, to be Fleſh as the other did. To this <hi>Theophylact</hi> anſwers, that if it appeared Fleſh to us, we ſhould be ſtruck with Horror at the ſight of it. <hi>It is,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>to the end we may not conceive Horror in the eating of it: For if it appeared to us to be Fleſh, we could not but abhor the Communion. It is then by an effect of God's Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our Weakneſs, that the Myſtical Food appears to us to be ſuch as we are uſed to.</hi> This Anſwer ſuffers us to conclude that 'tis not the Phyſical or Natural from of Fleſh, which is communicated to the Euchariſtical Bread, but the other; For if it received the Phyſical Form, as the Bread Chriſt eat did, it would appear Fleſh as well as that Bread did. All this agrees ſtill very well with the <hi>Greeks</hi> Hypotheſis.</p>
                        <p>BUT ſome will reply, this Anſwer is ſhort, for it does not ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:41961:171"/> what is this other Form which the Euchariſtical Bread receives, and which makes it the Body of Chriſt? I reply, the Anſwer would be ſhort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, had not <hi>Theophylact</hi> clearly explained himſelf thereon in his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary on St. <hi>Marc,</hi> wherein he propoſed the ſame doubt, as ariſing from the general Propoſition, that the Bread is Fleſh. <hi>This Bread,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>is not a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of our Lord's Body, but it is changed into the Lord's Body: The Bread which I ſhall give is my Fleſh. He does not ſay 'tis the Figure of my Fleſh, but my Fleſh. And in another place, if you eat not the Fleſh of the Son of Man.</hi> But it will be replied; <hi>how does it not appear to be Fleſh? O man, 'tis becauſe of thine Infirmities: For becauſe the Bread and Wine are Food familiar to us, and that we are not able to ſuffer Blood and Fleſh before us; God full of Mercy, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion to our Weakneſs, conſerves the Species of Bread and Wine, but changes them into the VIRTUE OF HIS FLESH AND BLOOD.</hi> It is clear he means that our Weakneſs not ſuffering us to eat Bread which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the natural form of Fleſh, God conſerves the Bread and Wine in their proper Species; but to make them his Fleſh and Blood, imprints on them this ſupernatural Virtue. Who ſees not that the whole Scope of his Diſcourſe tends to this; The Bread is the real Fleſh of Chriſt, not its Repreſentation, becauſe there muſt a proper Sence be given to our Lord's Words? But if it really be this Fleſh, why does it not appear Fleſh? It is by an effect of God's Condeſcention, which ſeeing we are not able to bear the ſight of Fleſh and Blood, makes the Bread his Fleſh, not by an Impreſſion of the ſubſtantial Form of Fleſh; but by an Impreſſion of Virtue.</p>
                        <p>IT appears then from the Explication which I now gave to <hi>Theophylact</hi>'s Diſcourſe. <hi>1st.</hi> That Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has been ſtrangely miſtaken when he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that to expound him according to our Sence; he muſt ſay, <hi>if it be ſo that the Bread contains the Virtue of Chriſt's Body, why does it not appear Fleſh to us?</hi> For this Doubt does not ariſe from the Bread's being Fleſh in Virtue; on the contrary, 'tis that which diſſipates the Doubt, and makes it vaniſh: It comes either from the general Propoſition that the Bread is Fleſh, and not the Figure of Fleſh; or from this other Propoſition, that it is Fleſh even as the Bread which Jeſus Chriſt eat was changed into his Fleſh; but the Doubt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves it ſelf by this laſt Propoſition, that it is changed into the Virtue of Fleſh and Blood.</p>
                        <p>SECONDLY, It appears likewiſe from thence, that <hi>Theophylact</hi> had not Tranſubſtantiation in his Thoughts: For if he had it in his Thoughts, he muſt have ſolved the Difficulty in another manner: He muſt have ſaid that the appearance of Bread remains; but that its Subſtance is changed into the Fleſh of Chriſt, and for this Reaſon does not appear Fleſh, but Bread. But yet notwithſtanding the Doubts would not have ceaſed as they do now, for it might be demanded, how this appearance of Bread ſubſiſted alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its natural Subſtance, how our Sences could be deceived by an appearance of Bread, which was not Bread; and by a real ſubſtance of Fleſh, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not Fleſh; how this ſame Subſtance of the Fleſh of Chriſt can be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and on Earth at the ſame time; and ſeveral other ſuch like Queſtions, which are not to be found in <hi>Theophylact</hi>'s Text. <hi>3dly.</hi> It appears likewiſe that <hi>Theophylact</hi> believed, that if the Bread was Fleſh otherwiſe, than by an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Virtue, it muſt needs appear Fleſh. For in ſaying that 'tis in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention to our Weakneſs, that God changes it into the Virtue of his Fleſh; he leaves it to be concluded that otherwiſe our Infirmities would not be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured, and we muſt unavoidably behold Fleſh in its natural Form.</p>
                        <pb n="312" facs="tcp:41961:172"/>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> not liking this change of Virtue, which is found thus deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in proper terms in <hi>Theophylact</hi>'s Diſcourſe, endeavours to give three dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Explications of them, and leaves us at liberty to chooſe either of them. Firſt, that by the virtue of Fleſh, we muſt underſtand the <hi>Reality, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Eſſence</hi> of this Fleſh. The ſecond, that this is a way of ſpeaking, which is uſual with the <hi>Greeks</hi> to ſay <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> the <hi>Force, or Power of Fleſh,</hi> to ſignify <hi>Fleſh full of Efficacy.</hi> The third, <hi>that when two things are joyned together in Truth, and in the Mind of thoſe to whom we ſpeak, it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Theſe 2.</note> 
                           <hi>that in expreſſing them, we denote but one, without excluding the other, and with a deſign to make the other understood, which we do not expreſs by that which we do.</hi> Which he afterwards explains in theſe Terms. <hi>It is certain that the Conſecrated Bread is changed into the Body of Chriſt: It is certain likewiſe that it becomes full of its Virtue and Efficacy. Theſe two Truths are joyned, and are the Conſequences of each other: And therefore it oft happens that Authors do joyntly expreſs them, as does</hi> Euthymius, <hi>who tells us in expreſs Terms, That as Jeſus Chriſt deified the Fleſh he took by a ſupernatural Operation, ſo he changes the Bread and Wine after an ineffable manner into his proper Body, which is the Fountain of Life, and into his proper Blood, and into the Virtue of both one and the other. But as theſe two changes are ſtill joyned in Effect, and the Fathers ſuppoſing they were joyned in the Spirit of the Faithful; It ſufficed them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the one, to make the other underſtood: And thus they tell us a hundred times that the Bread is changed into the Body of Chriſt, without expreſſing it is filled with its Virtue, becauſe one follows the other, and</hi> Theophylact <hi>having told us ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times that the Bread is changed into the Body of Chriſt, tells us once, that 'tis changed into its Strength, as the ſequel of a Myſtery which makes it conceived wholy entire, becauſe the Faith of the Faithful does not ſeparate the virtue of Chriſts Body, from the Body it ſelf, nor his Body from its Virtue, it never having entred into their Minds, that Chriſt's Body was in Heaven, and that we have only in the Euchariſt its Strength and Virtue, whereas they believe that we have only this Strength and Virtue, upon the account of its being really and truly preſent in our Myſteries.</hi> And 'tis by theſe Engines Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> pretends to draw Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation from the Paſſage of <hi>Theophylact.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT in general, all theſe three Explications appear to us to be forced, and neither of 'em to be choſen: There needs not this great ſtir to find <hi>Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact</hi>'s real Meaning. He means no more than what his Expreſſions plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, to wit, <hi>That the Bread and Wine are changed into the Virtue of the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, and he means nothing elſe.</hi> Had he believed a change of <hi>Subſtance,</hi> he would have ſaid ſo: as well as a Change of <hi>Virtue,</hi> and ſo much the rather as I obſerved, that the Difficulty which he propoſed to reſolve, obliged him to explain himſelf clearly about it. Why does not the Bread be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fleſh, appear to be ſo? Becauſe its Subſtance is only changed, and its Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents remain. A Man that believed Tranſubſtantiation muſt needs ſay thus.</p>
                        <p>THE firſt Explication eſpecially, can have no grounds, becauſe that when we ſpeak of the <hi>Virtue</hi> of a thing to ſignify <hi>its Truth, Reality, and inward Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence:</hi> It is only when the Queſtion concerns this Truth, or this Reality in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of its Operation or Effects, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Inſtances confirm what I ſay. For when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, ſpeaking of Hypocrites, that they have <hi>a Form or Appearance of Godlyneſs <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, but that they denied the Power,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, he means, they have only a falſe Appearance of it, a vain Shadow, but not the Reality of it, which is ſeen by its Effects. So when <hi>Heſychius</hi> ſay's
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:41961:172"/> 
                           <hi>that it is to receive the Communion ignorantly, not to know the Virtue and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of it, and to be ignorant that 'tis the Body and Blood of Chriſt according to Truth: That this is to receive the Myſtery, and not know the Virtue of them; he did not mean that the Myſteries were the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> but according to the ſpiritual Underſtanding, which is what he calls the Truth of the Myſtery, it is the Body and Blood of Chriſt, becauſe what offers it ſelf to our ſight, is only the Shadow and Vale of the Myſtery; but that the Divine Object repreſented by theſe ſenſible things, is the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt: Which is what he calls the <hi>Virtue of the Myſtery,</hi> becauſe its whole Operation and Effects depend only on them: As to what he alledges of <hi>Paſchaſius,</hi> beſides that he is an Author who affects Obſcurity, as is uſual with Innovators, and that there is a great deal of Injuſtice in regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Theophylact</hi>'s Sence, by his Expreſſions, beſides this I ſay, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can hinder us from ſaying that when he called the internal Eſſence of things their <hi>Virtue,</hi> it was in reſpect of their Operation and Effects. But this cannot be ſaid of <hi>Theophylact,</hi> for his Diſcourſe does not concern the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> but only to know, why the Bread being the Fleſh of Chriſt, yet does not appear Fleſh. If then he would ſay, it is becauſe the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Bread remains, and that its Subſtance is changed into the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Body of Chriſt, to what purpoſe ſhould he explain himſelf in this manner, <hi>it is changed into the Virtue of the Body.</hi> Why ſhould he ſay <hi>Virtue</hi> for Subſtance, ſeeing that here there was no Queſtion raiſed about the Efficacy of the Sacrament.</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s ſecond Explication, is no better than the firſt. He tells us tis an uſual way of ſpeaking amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> to ſay <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>the Strength, or Power of Fleſh;</hi> to ſignifie the Fleſh full of Efficacy. But not to enter into the Diſcuſſion of his Criticiſm, concerning which much might be ſaid, did he only pretend to prove it by two Verſes of <hi>Horace,</hi> by a Paſſage of <hi>Paſchaſius Ratbert,</hi> and another of St. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s. I ſay that when Authors expreſs themſelves in this manner, <hi>the Virtue of a thing,</hi> to ſignify <hi>a thing full of Virtue or Efficacy,</hi> 'tis only when they conſider this thing under the Idea of its Virtue or Efficacy, and not otherwiſe; Thus when <hi>Horace</hi> ſay's, <hi>The Virtue of</hi> Scipio, <hi>and the Wiſdom of</hi> Lelius: It is becauſe he conſidered them under the Quality of Virtuous and Wiſe, as we call the King <hi>his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> then when we are filled with the Idea of his Greatneſs. It is the ſame in theſe Expreſſions <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>the Force or Rapidity of the River, for a ſwift River,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>the ſtrength of</hi> Hercules, <hi>for the valiant</hi> Hercules, for then they are conſidered under the Idea of their Strength. Our Saviour ſay's, <hi>the Virtue of the Holy Spirit,</hi> when he meant the Effects of the Power of the Holy Spirit on the Apoſtles. St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſay's likewiſe in the ſame Sence, <hi>that the wiſe Men acknowledged the Virtue of God in the weak Body of a Child,</hi> becauſe he deſigned to oppoſe the eternal Power of the Divinity, to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Childhood. But there is no ſuch thing in the Paſſage of <hi>Theophylact,</hi> for he does not conſider the Fleſh of Chriſt in reſpect of the Effects which it diſplays on the Faithful, but ſimply conſiders it in Reference to the Bread which is changed into it, and the Point is not to know, as I have already ſaid, why this Bread produces ſo great Effects; but only why being Fleſh, it does not appear Fleſh, but Bread. So that theſe two pretended Explications of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s are but mere Evaſions, being Groundleſs and Improbable.</p>
                        <p>AS to the third, did ever any man ſee any thing more forc'd, and Illuſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>y, than this whole Diſcourſe he makes to eſtabliſh it. <hi>When the Bread,</hi> ſay's he,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:41961:173"/> 
                           <hi>is changed into the Body of Chriſt, it becomes full of its Virtue and Efficacy.</hi> What means Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> by this? If the Bread be changed into the Subſtance of Chriſt's Fleſh, it ceaſes to be Bread: Now that which ceaſes to be, is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger filled with any thing, becauſe 'tis abſolutely no longer in being. There remains only the external Figure, and when we underſtand that 'tis this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Figure that is filled, we cannot ſay that that which is changed is filled, for 'tis not the Figure that is changed. It is certain when a Mans Head is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very full of Philoſophical Notions, they make him forget himſelf.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>IT ſometimes happens,</hi> adds he, <hi>that Authors expreſs theſe two Truths joyntly together, as</hi> Euthymius <hi>has done.</hi> But I already ſhewed that <hi>Euthymius</hi> in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Bread and Wine are changed into the Body and Blood, and into the Virtue of both; never deſigned thereby to expreſs two different things; but only made uſe of two different Expreſſions, to ſignify one and the ſame thing; the latter of which is only the Explication of the former, his <hi>Et,</hi> being to be taken, for a <hi>that is to ſay.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> goes on and ſay's <hi>that</hi> Theophylact <hi>having ſaid ſeveral times the Bread is changed into the Body of Chriſt, tells us once 'tis changed into his Strength, as an effect of the Myſtery, which makes it conceived intire.</hi> But it is eaſy to anſwer him, that when <hi>Theophylact</hi> ſay's the Bread is changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Body, and that it is changed into the Virtue of the Body, theſe are neither two diſtinct things, nor two parts of the Myſtery, but two Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which ſignify at bottom but one and the ſame thing; with this Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that the one is general, and th'other particular, the one more confuſed, and th'other more diſtinct, the one, which gives way in ſome ſort to the Doubt by its generality, and th'other which reſolves it. It is certain he has ſaid ſeveral times the Bread is changed into the Body, and only once, 'that 'tis changed into the Virtue of the Body, but it is alſo true, that he never ſaid it is changed into the Subſtance of the Body. If he only once ſpake of the Change of Virtue, this once is ſufficient to ſhew his meaning. Others have mentioned it as well as he, as <hi>Theodotus, Cyrillus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Victor</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, Eutychius, Euthymius, Ely de Crete.</hi> Who could ever be perſwaded all theſe Authors (who lived in divers times) have conſpired together to ſay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>Virtue,</hi> and never <hi>Subſtance,</hi> altho they had in their Thoughts a Change of <hi>Subſtance,</hi> and not of <hi>Virtue.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE Language of the <hi>Greeks</hi> is Conformable to that of <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> his Adverſaries, as he ſhews us himſelf in his Commentary on St. <hi>Mathew.</hi> They ſaid the Bread was changed into the Virtue of the Fleſh of Chriſt, and <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſius</hi> is not ſo nice in his Language as Mr. <hi>Arnaud.</hi> He neither ſay's the Virtue ſignifies Verity, Reality, internal Eſſence, nor that the Virtue of the Fleſh, ſignifies the Fleſh full of Virtue, nor that 'tis only one part of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery which ſignifies the other. All theſe Turnings were not in faſhion in his time: He very honeſtly takes this Term in the true Sence of thoſe that uſed it. <hi>I am aſtoniſhed,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>at what ſome ſay now,</hi> viz. <hi>that the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>is not</hi>

                           <hi>communicated to the Water of Baptiſm, and the Oyl of Confirmation.</hi> It ſeems to me here's a manifeſt Contradiction, for if the Faithful do not ſeparate the Virtue of Chriſt's Body, from the Body it ſelf, that is to ſay according as he underſtands it from the Subſtance of his Body: How does the Water of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and the Oyl of Confirmation contain the Virtue of this Body, ſeeing 'tis out of Doubt that they contain not the Subſtance of them? But whence has he learned ſuch a profound kind of Doctrine, that the Faith of the Faithful does not ſeparate the Virtue of Chriſt's Body, from the Body it ſelf? Does not this Virtue accompany the Word of God which St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>the Power of God to Salvation,</hi> and in which, notwithſtanding there is not to be imagined a Preſence of the Subſtance of Chriſt's Body? Does he not know that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers teach, We eat our Saviour's Fleſh, as well in the hearing of the Word, as in the Participation of Baptiſm, which can only be underſtood of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ſeparated from the Subſtance? If Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſay's that he underſtands this as meant only of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> beſides that his Terms are general, and in manner of a Principle, which he afterwards applies to the <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this I ſay, this does not at all reſolve the Queſtion, ſeeing our Debate is, Whether the Virtue of the Body is in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> together with the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or whether it be in it alone, and without the Subſtance. Wherefore muſt not the Faithful who acknowledg in other Particulars this Virtue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Subſtance, acknowledg the ſame thing in the <hi>Eucharist</hi>?</p>
                        <p>AND this is what I had to ſay to the Paſſage of <hi>Theophylact,</hi> and which may likewiſe ſerve for an Illuſtration to what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> alledges out of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Methonienſis.</hi> This Author wrote a Treatiſe which is inſerted in the <note place="margin">Bibl.

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:41961:174"/> Doubts touching the Virtue of Baptiſm: <hi>Is this then this great Myſtery which Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor yet hath entred into the Heart of Man to conceive? I ſee the ſame Water which I ſee every Day, is this that which muſt cleanſe me?</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> muſt not imagine it is ſo eaſy a matter for weak and prophane Perſons, to believe a ſupernatural Virtue to be communicated to the Bread and Wine. We have already ſeen that <hi>Cyrillus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Ely de Creté,</hi> having told us that God changes the Bread into the Virtue of his Body; add, <hi>that we muſt not doubt of it, ſeeing Chriſt himſelf ſay's it,</hi> which ſhows that this is as much a Subject of Doubt, as any thing elſe.</p>
                        <p>BUT there is no neceſſity of expounding in this Sence the Doubt of thoſe of whom <hi>Nicholas Methonienſis</hi> ſpeaks: His Expreſſions muſt not be altered. They doubted whether the Bread and Wine were the Body and Blood of Chriſt, and this Doubt aroſe from the general and uſual Expreſſions of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who poſitively affirm it. What can be concluded hence? The <hi>Greeks</hi> then underſtand theſe general Expreſſions in a Sence of Tranſubſtantiation, or real Preſence. I deny it, and that with Reaſon; for this does not follow: But it will be replied, theſe Doubters at leaſt believed their Church, took them in this Sence, and 'tis likely this was the Occaſion of their Doubt. Which I alſo deny, for if theſe were their Thoughts, why did they not tell us ſo? Why could not they ſay they doubted of the Truth of this Doctrine, that the Bread and Wine are changed into the Subſtance of the Body and Blood of Chriſt. To what purpoſe ſo many Words? This Propoſition, <hi>the Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> offended them; and which way ſoever they turn'd it, it could not ſeem to them capable of a rational Sence. Whether this Doubt aroſe thro want of a thro-Conſideration, or whether in effect they had exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the matter, or had conſidered the Propoſition, either confuſedly in it ſelf, or in the Expoſition, the <hi>Greeks</hi> gave of it, is more than we know, for <hi>Nicolas Methonienſis</hi> ſay's nothing of it, and we cannot inform our ſelves elſewhere. This is a matter of Fact, on which every Man may make his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, but yet this Principle muſt remain undenyable, that their Doubt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe from this Propoſition, <hi>the Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and not from this other, <hi>the Bread is Tranſubſtantiated into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>LET Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſhew us if he pleaſes, how it happens that between theſe two Doubts which <hi>Theophylact</hi> and <hi>Nicolas Methonienſis</hi> propoſe, there ariſes never a one touching the ſubſtantial Converſion; for ſuppoſing the <hi>Greeks</hi> believed it, it could not be, but ſome muſt doubt and ſay, how is the Subſtance of Bread changed into that of the Body of Chriſt; even as they ſay'd, how is Bread Fleſh? How is Bread the Body? The Languages, which <note place="margin">Lib. 2. c. 13. p. 223.</note> according to Mr. <hi>Arnaud, are not ſo barren but they can furniſh us with Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to ſay, I doubt whether the Bread contains the Virtue of Chriſt's Body, I doubt whether it is the Figure of the Body of Chriſt?</hi> Can they not likewiſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them with proper Terms, who would ſay, <hi>I doubt whether the Subſtance of Bread is changed into the Subſtance of Chriſt's Body</hi>?</p>
                        <p>THERE is nothing then in the Doubt of theſe People which <hi>Nicholas Methonienſis</hi> handles, which can favour Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Cauſe. Neither is there any thing in his Anſwer which will do him any Kindneſs. <hi>Nicolaus Methoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſis</hi> ſays, <hi>that the Bread is changed into the Body of Chriſt. That this Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Sacrifice takes its Original from our Lord himſelf: That we muſt not deſpiſe what has been taught us by this Divine Mouth which cannot lye: That 'twas he himſelf told us, this is my Body, this is my Blood, and if you eat not the Fleſh of</hi>
                           <pb n="317" facs="tcp:41961:174"/> 
                           <hi>the Son of Man, nor drink his Blood, you have no Life in you. That we muſt not charge him with want of Power, ſeeing he is Almighty: That his Body was born of a Virgin above the courſe of Nature, and above the Thoughts and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of Men.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is ſo well ſatisfied with theſe Expreſſions, that he cries out in a Tranſport of Joy, <hi>that they are juſt, natural, and befitting</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 226.</note> 
                           <hi>a Biſhop to Utter, that believes Tranſubſtantiation, and Refutes thoſe that do not!</hi> But what is there in all this, which does not agree with the Sentiment of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> being ſuch as I have repreſented it, in the thirteenth Chapter of the foregoing Book? The Bread is changed into the Body of Chriſt, by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his ſupernatural Virtue, and is made this Body by way of Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: This is an Effect of his almighty Power, which acts above the Courſe of Nature; But it does not follow that this is a Tranſubſtantiation. Had <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus Methonienſis</hi> meant a Change of Subſtance, why could he not ſay ſo, the Tongues which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has ſo inriched when the <hi>Virtue of the Body</hi> was in Queſtion, muſt they immediately become ſo poor again, when the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerns that of Subſtance? Could not they furniſh this Biſhop with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Terms, to ſay that the Subſtance of Bread is changed into that of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? Which is what he ought to find in <hi>Nicholas</hi> his Expreſſions to bear him out in his Exultations. But Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> can find matter of Triumph when he pleaſes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>NICOLAUS Methonienſis</hi> continuing his Diſcourſe, adds, <hi>perhaps you doubt of this Myſtery, and do not Believe it becauſe you do not ſee Fleſh and Blood.</hi> He means according to Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> ſay's Mr. <hi>Arnaud, perhaps you do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi>

                           <hi>the Bread and Wine contain the Virtue of Chriſt's Body and Blood, becauſe you do not ſee Fleſh and Blood; as if there muſt appear Fleſh and Blood, that we may believe the Bread and Wine contain the Virtue of them. Theſe Peoples Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning,</hi> adds he, <hi>would conſiſt according to Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>in a very pleaſant Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if the Bread and Wine Contain'd the Virtue of Chriſt's Body, there would appear Fleſh and Blood in the Euchariſt, but there does not appear Fleſh and Blood; Therefore they do not contain the Virtue thereof.</hi> He enhaunceth this Remark by an Example taken from my Book, which contains, ſay's he, morally my Virtue, ſo that it may be demanded why my Perſon does not appear in all the Chambers wherein my Book is read.</p>
                        <p>THIS Diſcourſe is ſo full of Error, that I can ſcarce believe it is Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi>'s own. <hi>1ſt.</hi> Suppoſing we do attribute to theſe Dubitants the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he has formed, he cannot call it <hi>a pleaſant and ridiculous Argument,</hi> as he has done, without contradicting himſelf, and deriding his own Maxim, which he laid down in his Chapter touching <hi>Theophylact, That the Faith of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>

                           <hi>doth never ſeparate the Virtue of Chriſt's Body, from the Body it ſelf, nor his Body from his Virtue, and that it never entred into their Thoughts the Body of Chriſt was in Heaven, and that we receive only in the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>its Strength and Virtue, whereas they believe we receive only this Strength and Virtue, from its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing really and truly preſent in our Myſteries.</hi> Suppoſing that <hi>Nicolaus Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nienſis</hi> his Doubters, reaſoned on the Principle of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Believers, their Argument would contain nothing but what is natural and reaſonable. For if the Virtue of Chriſt's Body be only in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> upon the account of his Body being really and truly Preſent in it, it naturally follows there muſt appear Fleſh therein, ſeeing the Virtue thereof cannot but be accompanied by this Fleſh, according to Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> and his Faithful. This Reaſoning muſt be wholly grounded on two Propoſitions, the one, that whereſoever the Body of Chriſt is ſubſtantially preſent, there muſt appear Fleſh, this is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:41961:175"/> Conſequence; th'other, that the Virtue of this Body is only in the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,</hi> becauſe the Body it ſelf is ſubſtantially in it, this is Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Faith. If this Reaſoning be <hi>Pleaſant</hi> and <hi>Ridiculous,</hi> it cannot be ſo upon the account of the firſt Propoſition; for as I ſaid, it is ſelf Evident. It muſt be ſo then by reaſon of the ſecond, that is to ſay, upon the Account of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Faith. Is it not ſtrange Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſhould forget himſelf ſo ſoon as ever he has leap'd out of one Chapter into another, and ridicule himſelf. I confeſs it may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that a Man, altho otherwiſe conſiderative may fall into Contradiction; for there are few Perſons but what are lyable to Miſtakes; But it is ſtrange a Man ſhould combat and fall foul on himſelf, becauſe that when we are ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly intent on any Subject, the Ideas thereof return, and Attention furniſhes us with that Matter which offered not it ſelf at firſt. But that ſuch a man of Parts as Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> ſhould Contradict and Confute himſelf, and Scoff at his own Aſſertions in the ſame Book, at three Chapters Diſtance, is in my Mind a little amazing.</p>
                        <p>II. BUT moreover, 'tis certain Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has been plainly miſtaken in the Arguing which he attributes according to us, to <hi>Nicolaus Methonienſis</hi> his Dubitants. For we never told him their Doubt was grounded on the Bread's being the Body of Chriſt in Virtue. <hi>Perhaps,</hi> ſay's <hi>Nicolaus Methonienſis, Ye doubt of this Myſtery, and do not believe it, becauſe ye do not ſee Fleſh and Blood in it.</hi> Their Doubt was grounded on the general Propoſition of the <hi>Greeks:</hi> That the Bread and Wine were the Body and Blood of Chriſt. <hi>Nicolas</hi> ſay's, perhaps this Propoſition appeared to them incredible, becauſe they did not ſee Fleſh and Blood in the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> We ſhould know whether theſe Doubters acknowledged, this was in effect the real Cauſe of their Doubt; but ſuppoſing it were, all that can be concluded thence, is that they would Reaſon in this ſort, If the Bread be the Body of Chriſt it muſt appear Fleſh; But it does not, therefore it is not Fleſh. This Reaſoning oppoſes the Expreſſion of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that the Bread is the Body of Chriſt, as alſo the Example which they gave of it, to wit, of the Bread which our Saviour eat; but it does not diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the Expoſition which they gave of it, which is, that it is the Body of Chriſt in Virtue; on the contrary we have already obſerved, that <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylact</hi> uſes this Expoſition for the ſolving of the Objection contained in this Reaſoning: Which plainly ſhews that whilſt this Propoſition, <hi>the Bread is the Body of Chriſt,</hi> ſtands alone, and unexplained; it may give occaſion to Ignorant People to form this Objection, but as ſoon as 'tis explained and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in what Sence the <hi>Greeks</hi> underſtand it, the Doubt vaniſhes.</p>
                        <p>AND this will more plainly appear, if we conſider the Anſwer which <hi>Nicolaus Methonienſis</hi> made to thoſe that doubted, for it comes very near to that of <hi>Theophylact. God,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>reſpecting our Weakneſs, leſt we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Horror at the Pledges of Eternal Life, as being not able to indure the ſight of Fleſh and Blood, does therefore deliver to us things familiar to our Nature, and has joyned to them his Divinity, ſaying, this is my Body, this is my Blood.</hi> This Anſwer does in a manner explain in what Sence the <hi>Greeks</hi> believed the Bread was the Body of Chriſt, to wit, by its Union with the Divinity, which does very well ſolve the Argument of the Doubters, and bereaves it of its Strength. For if it be the Body of Chriſt only by this means, to wit, by its Union with the Divinity, there is no longer occaſion to ſay it ſhould appear Fleſh.</p>
                        <p>IT is then clear that this whole Diſpute of <hi>Nicolaus Methonienſis</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws Tranſubſtantiation, as well as that of <hi>Theophylact.</hi> For as to thoſe
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:41961:175"/> that doubted, had they known the Greek Church taught that the Subſtance of Bread is changed into that of the Body, they would have grounded their Objection, not on the general Propoſition, <hi>that the Bread is the Body;</hi> but on the particular one, to wit, <hi>that the Bread is changed into the Subſtance of the Body,</hi> whence it more ſtrongly and diſtinctly follows that it ought to appear Fleſh after the Change. And as to the Anſwer return'd them, they muſt have been told that the Subſtance only is changed, and that the Accidents of Bread remain to ſerve as a Vail to the Fleſh of Chriſt; This is what ought to be anſwered on the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of Tranſubſtantiation, and not that the Bread is joyned to the Divinity. This Anſwer would be abſurd if we ſuppoſe Tranſubſtantiation, of the Difficulty would ſtill remain, Why the Bread becoming the Subſtance of our Lord's proper Fleſh, it does not appear Fleſh? Yet <hi>Nicolaus Methonienſis</hi> will have theſe Objectors reſt ſatified with his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and extends not their Doubts any farther.</p>

It is certain this is all can be concluded thence, and yet Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has not fail'd to draw this Profeſſion of Faith to his Advantage: But ſeeing he deſigned to make a Proof of it, it ſeems to me, he ought at leaſt to rehearſe truly the Terms of it, and not alter them as he has done in his Verſion. <hi>I believe,</hi> ſay's the Convert, <hi>and confeſs the Bread and Wine which</hi>

                           <hi>I believe, I confeſs that the Bread and Wine myſtically Conſecrated by the Chriſtians, and of which they partake in the Celebration of the Holy Myſteries, are in truth the Body and Blood of our Lord, being changed by his Divine Virtue, in a manner not to be perceived by our Eyes, and diſcernible only to the Mind, but</hi>

Theſe two Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes being thus diſtinguiſhed, it is clear the firſt ſuppoſes that 'tis Bread and Wine; and this Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would conceal by confounding them in one. <hi>2dly.</hi> Inſtead of rendring <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>AND yet with all theſe Alterations Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> can conclude nothing from this Profeſſion of Faith, unleſs it be, that the Bread and Wine are in truth the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and that they are changed by his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Virtue: But this is not the Point we diſputed on: They are then chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in reſpect of their Subſtance: It is this Conſequence which we deny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In Effect, whether the Bread and Wine are the Body and Blood of Chriſt by a change of Virtue, and by way of Augmentation, as the <hi>Greeks</hi> explain it, or otherwiſe; it is certain that they are ſo truly, and not falſly; So th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now this ſuppoſes on one hand that they are ſtill Bread and Wine, and on the other, that we muſt not proceed ſo far as to a change of Subſtance.</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> then advertiſes the World to no purpoſe, <hi>That theſe kind of Writings are deſign'd to repreſent the General, Publick, and Univerſal Sentiments of the Church, and not the Particular Sentiment of Authors. That they contain an</hi>

                           <hi>Converted</hi> Sarracens <hi>believe that the Bread and Wine were not truly the Body and Blood of Christ, but only his Figure indued with their Virtue.</hi> This is not the Point; the Queſtion is to know whether they were taught the Converſion of Subſtances, which is what he ought to ſhow, but this he will be never able
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:41961:176"/> to do. For, for to teach that the Bread and Wine are really the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, (which is what is preciſely contain'd in this Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith) is not as (as I have already ſaid) the teaching the Converſion of Subſtances. Moreover I never told him the modern <hi>Greeks</hi> aſſerted the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt</hi> to be a Figure: And as to the Change of Virtue we do not prove it, it is true by this Profeſſion of Faith, but we prove it by other Teſtimonies, which are ſo plain and expreſſive that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> can give no ſolid Anſwer to them.</p>
                        <p>THERE only remain now of all thoſe pretended Proofs of Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud,</hi> ſome Paſſages out of <hi>Cabaſilas</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Theſſalonica, Simeon</hi> Biſhop alſo of <hi>Theſſalonica, Jeremias</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and ſome other Greek Authors. They all ſay near upon the ſame thing, which is, <hi>That the Bread and Wine are the Body and Blood of Chriſt: This very Body and Blood. That they are changed into this Body and Blood.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> muſt diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe himſelf once for all, touching the Thoughts he has, that from theſe kind of Expreſſions may be concluded the Doctrine of the Converſion of Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: For ſo far are we from granting this Concluſion to be good, that we pretend we have Reaſon to draw a contrary Conſequence. In effect. <hi>1ſt.</hi> There is nothing more uſual in Authors than to ſay, That <hi>the Poor are Jeſus Chriſt, even Chriſt himſelf, that the Church is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, the very Body of Jeſus Chriſt, that we are changed into Jeſus Chriſt, changed into his Body, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into him, changed into his Fleſh:</hi> and ſuch like ways of ſpeaking, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of which are infinite. It is then a great Abuſe to pretend theſe Terms are to be underſtood in a Sence of Identity and ſubſtantial Converſion, as they term it. For (as I ſaid elſewhere,) theſe Expreſſions being lyable to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in divers particular Sences, and ſeeing they may be taken in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and indiſtinct one, there can be no Reaſon for the taking them, in the Sence which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> gives them.</p>
                        <p>II. THE Converſion of the Subſtances of Bread and Wine into thoſe of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, does of it ſelf, form ſo preciſe and diſtinct a Sence, that when Authors would aſſert it, they explain it in clear and diſtinct Terms, which anſwer the diſtinct determinate Conception they have of it. Whence it follows, that if the Greek Authors had on this Subject the ſame Belief as the Roman Church, they would explain themſelves ſo clearly, that there would be no need of running to the Baron of <hi>Spartaris,</hi> nor <hi>Payſius Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garidius,</hi> nor yet to the ſix Syrian Prieſts to make us underſtand it.</p>
                        <p>FOR whilſt he produces no other kind of Paſſages but ſuch as theſe, we ſhall have ſtill Reaſon to conclude from hence, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not believe Tranſubſtantiation, becauſe if they did believe it, they would without doubt ſpeak otherwiſe of it.</p>
                        <p>III. BUT ſuppoſing theſe Reaſons Invalid, we have ſhewed (when we treated of the real Belief of the <hi>Greeks)</hi> in what Sence they underſtand theſe Expreſſions. In effect, if we compare the Doctrine of the <hi>Greeks</hi> with that of the <hi>Latins,</hi> and throly comprehend what they hold in common, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they differ, we ſhall eaſily perceive Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Sophiſm, for whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he alledges from Greek Authors, reſpects this Equivocal part of their Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, which he believed to be like that of the <hi>Latins,</hi> altho at bottom 'tis not ſo; but he has ſtudiouſly avoided the relating any thing concerning this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Part, by which the two Hypotheſis's diſtinguiſh themſelves, and vary
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:41961:177"/> from one another. The <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> agree in theſe general Expreſſions, <hi>The Bread is made the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, The Bread is changed into the Body of Christ, it becomes the very Body, the proper Body, the real Body of Chriſt. They are not two Bodies, but one Body.</hi> So far you ſee they hold the ſame Language.</p>
                        <p>BUT go farther, ask them whether the nature of Bread ceaſes to be. The <hi>Latins</hi> anſwer, there remains nothing of its Subſtance, nor Matter, nor inward Form, but only the Accidents. The <hi>Greeks</hi> on the contrary ſay, That the Bread is joyned to the Divinity, that from this Union reſults one compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of two Natures, that there is made a Compoſition of Bread and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit. Ask the <hi>Latins</hi> how the Bread is made the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; They Anſwer, by the Converſion of its whole Subſtance, into the Subſtance which this Body had before the Converſion. The <hi>Greeks</hi> on the contrary ſay, the Bread becomes an Augmentation of the natural Body of our Lord, and is made by this means his Body: Ask them what Change the Bread receives; the <hi>Latins</hi> ſay it is a real Tranſubſtantiation, (that is to ſay) the change of one Subſtance into another. The <hi>Greeks</hi> on the contrary anſwer, that it is a Sanctification which the Bread receives, and that it is changed into the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Virtue of Chriſt's Body. Ask the <hi>Latins</hi> how the Bread becomes the real Body, the very Body, the proper Body of our Lord born of the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> They anſwer, 'tis becauſe in effect the ſame numerical Subſtance, without any Difference. The <hi>Greeks</hi> on the contrary ſay, that 'tis becauſe an Augmentation makes not another Body, than that which receives Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and they make uſe of the Example of a Child, which Eating, and Drinking and Growing by this means, has not two Bodies, but one.</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> then has in vain, collected all the Paſſages of <hi>Cabaſilas</hi> which aſſert, <hi>The Gifts are changed into the Body and Blood of Chriſt, that the Bread is</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 8.</note> 
                           <hi>the very Body of our Saviour, the Sacrifice offered for the Salvation of the World, that the Lord is ſeen and handled by means of the Holy and Dreadful Myſteries, and that we receive him in the Euchariſt.</hi> Theſe Expreſſions are common both to the <hi>Latins</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> from whence he can conclude nothing, to the Prejudice of theſe Differences we have obſerved, and which decide the Queſtion.</p>
                        <p>IT is in vain he tells us, that <hi>Cabaſilas Diſputing againſt the</hi> Latins, <hi>on the Subject of this Prayer which they make after the Conſecration:</hi> Jube ſurſum ferri dona haec in manu angeli ad ſupercaeleſte tuum Altare: <hi>Reaſons on theſe four Principles which include the real Preſence, and Tranſubſtantiation. 1ſt. That we ought not to wiſh the Body of Chriſt be taken up from us. 2ly. That the Body of Chriſt being in Heaven and on Earth, we ought not to deſire it ſhould be carried up into Heaven, becauſe it is there already. 3dly. That it cannot be offered by Angels, becauſe it is above Angels. 4ly. That we cannot without Impiety wiſh the Gifts a greater Dignity, ſeeing they are the Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>AS to what concerns the firſt of theſe: <hi>Cabaſilas</hi> ſay's only, <hi>We muſt not pray that the Holy Gifts be taken away from us, but on the contrary, that they may remain with us, and muſt believe they do ſo, becauſe it is thus that Chriſt is with us to the end of the World:</hi> Hitherto we ſee neither Tranſubſtantiation, nor <note place="margin">Cabaſ. expoſ. Liturg. c. 30.</note> real Preſence. As to the <hi>2d. Cabaſilas</hi> ſay's, <hi>That if the</hi> Latins <hi>acknowledged it to be the Body of Chriſt, they muſt believe he is with us, and that he is above the Heavens, ſeated at the right Hand of the Father, in a manner known to him,</hi> which ſtill ſuppoſes neither real Preſence, nor Tranſubſtantiation. For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:41961:177"/> to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> which is on the Earth, being the Growth of the Body of Chriſt, is one and the ſame Body with that in Heaven. So that in manner, the ſame Body is in Heaven and on Earth; In Heaven, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of its natural Subſtance, and on Earth, in reſpect of the Myſtery, which is its Growth; which is far from the Sence of the <hi>Latins,</hi> and does not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any Tranſubſtantiation. As to the <hi>3d. How,</hi> ſay's <hi>Cabaſilas, can that be carried up by an Angel which is above all Principalities and Powers, and above every Name.</hi> But, methinks this would be to extend the uſe of Conſequences too far, to conclude from hence that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is the Body of Chriſt in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of Subſtance. For it is ſufficient to eſtabliſh the Truth of what <hi>Caba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilas</hi> ſay's, that the Bread is the Body of Chriſt in Virtue, and by way of Growth, as we have already obſerved the <hi>Greeks</hi> explain it, ſeeing it is true that this Dignity raiſes it up in ſome Sence above the Angels themſelves, not in reſpect of its Nature or Subſtance, but in reſpect of the Virtue which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies it, which is the ſupernatural Virtue of our Lord's Body. As to the <hi>4th.</hi> It is certain that <hi>Cabaſilas</hi> has had reaſon to ſay that if the <hi>Latins</hi> deſired the Gifts might after their Conſecration receive ſome new Dignity, and a Change into a better State, their Prayer would be impious, ſeeing they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged they were already the Body of Chriſt. <hi>For,</hi> as he afterwards adds, <hi>to what more excellent or Holy State can we believe they paſs into?</hi> His Reaſoning is good, but I do not ſee it includes (as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> tells us) the real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and Tranſubſtantiation: He ought to ſhew us this, and not aſſert it without Proof; for it may very well be ſaid in the Sence of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that the Bread is capable of no higher a Dignity, than that of receiving the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Virtue of Chriſt's Body, and to be made this Body by way of Growth and Augmentation.</p>
                        <p>IT is moreover in Vain Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> endeavours to ſhew that in the Sence of <hi>Cabaſilas</hi> Chriſt does not really dye in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> for we never im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted <note place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 8.</note> to this Author ſo ſtrange a Doctrine: Neither have we ween deceiv'd touching the Participles <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, which is to ſay that <hi>Cabaſilas</hi> means that the Body has been ſlain here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, and not at preſent. But this does not hinder it from being true, as I ſaid in my Anſwer to the <hi>Perpetuity, that</hi> Cabaſilas <hi>has reſpect to the Body of Chriſt in the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>as dead,</hi> that is to ſay under a reſpect or quality of <note place="margin">Anſwer to the <hi>2d</hi> Treat. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note> Death. Which appears by what he ſay's, <hi>that it is not an Image or Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a Sacrifice, but a real Sacrifice, not of Bread, but of the Body of Chriſt,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Cabaſ. expoſ. Lit. cap. 32.</note> 
                           <hi>and that there is but one Sacrifice of the Lamb, of him which was once offered.</hi> Whence it follows that Chriſt is in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> as Dead, and Sacrificed on the Croſs, which is preciſely what I ſaid.</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will ſay that the Conſequence which I draw, to wit, that Chriſt is not ſubſtantially preſent in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> is contrary to <hi>Cabaſilas</hi> his Diſcourſe, who aſſures us, <hi>That the Bread is changed into the thing Sacrificed, altho the Sacrifice is not preſently offered;</hi> But Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> having never well <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> comprehended the Hypotheſis of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> it is no marvel if he has miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:41961:178"/> 
                           <hi>Cabaſilas</hi> his Sence in this Diſcourſe which he makes of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in his thirty ſecond Chapter. The <hi>Greeks</hi> will have the Bread paſs thro all the Degrees of the <hi>Oeconomy,</hi> thro which the Body of Chriſt has paſſed, that as the Holy Spirit came upon the Subſtance of the Holy Virgin, ſo does he come upon the Bread; that as the Body of Chriſt was in a corruptible ſtate, Crucifi'd, and Buried; ſo in like manner the Bread is firſt Corruptible, lifted up as it were upon a Croſs, and buried in our Bodies, as in a Sepulchre. That, in fine, it becomes incorruptible as the Body of Chriſt was after his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which they eſtabliſh by this Reaſon, that the Bread is an augmentation of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; and that as Nature obſerves on the Food which nouriſhes us, and augments our Body, the ſame order ſhe kept in the firſt matter from which we were formed. So Grace obſerves in the Euchariſtical Bread, the ſame order ſhe obſerves in the Natural Body. By this means they will have the Bread become firſt the Body of Chriſt, in aſmuch as 'tis Mortal and Corruptible, that it be afterwards this dead Body; and in fine, this Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible and Raiſed Body. <hi>Cabaſilas</hi> his Sence then is, that when the Bread is myſtically ſacrificed, it is made the dead Body of Jeſus Chriſt, as he ſpeaks himſelf, <hi>the Lamb ſlain,</hi> not that the Body ſuffers Death in this Moment, but becauſe in this Moment the Bread paſſes thro the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of Death. And thus the Bread is changed into the dead Body of our Lord, not that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our dyes in effect, but becauſe the Bread which is the Growth of his Body, is then changed into this Body, in as much as it ſuffered Death heretofore. And this is <hi>Cabaſilas</hi> his real Sence, which is conformable to the Hypotheſis of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and not that which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> attributes to him.</p>
                        <p>HE likewiſe uſes to no purpoſe ſeveral Paſſages out of <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica.</hi> They ſay nothing but what I already often anſwered, to wit, <hi>That the Bread is the real Body of Jeſus Chriſt, that it is the very Body of Chriſt,</hi> and I ſhewed in what Sence the <hi>Greeks</hi> uſe theſe Expreſſions, and therefore will not any more repeat it. I likewiſe anſwered what he alledged touching the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and the unconſecrated Particles.</p>
                        <p>AS to <hi>Jeremias</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> we may well wonder that he ſhould ſo confidently offer him us as a Perſon that teaches Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeeing that not only <hi>Jeremias</hi> holds the ſame Language as the others, but aſſerts ſeveral things which oppoſes the Roman Doctrine. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving according to his Cuſtom impertinently related ſeveral hiſtorical Paſſages, <note place="margin">Lib. 4. c. 4.</note> tells us, <hi>That the Article of the</hi> Ausbourg <hi>Confeſſion, which reſpects the Sacrament, expreſly aſſerting the real Preſence, but not mentioning Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remias <hi>anſwers, that Point is handled in it very briefly and obſcurely,</hi> and adds, <hi>that the Catholick Church holds the Bread is changed into the very Body and Blood of our Lord thro the Holy Spirit.</hi> So that then <hi>Jeremias</hi> held Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: And thus does Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> draw his Conſequences; But he is too quick. Some Proteſtants in <hi>Germany</hi> ſent the <hi>Auſbourg</hi> Confeſſion to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> without any Commentary or Expoſition on it. The Patriarch examining its tenth Article, which runs thus, <hi>Touching the Lord's Supper, they hold the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt are really preſent in it, and are diſtributed to thoſe that participate thereof, and condemn the Opinion of thoſe that hold the contrary:</hi> He ſay's, <hi>This Article treats of the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per very briefly, and to ſay the Truth, ſomewhat obſcurely; For,</hi> adds he, <hi>we are told ſeveral things of you which we do not approve.</hi> To ſay hereupon that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> underſtood this Article in the Sence of the real Preſence, and that the <hi>Greeks</hi> could not be ignorant of it, ſignifies nothing. For it appears that
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:41961:178"/> the Patriarch only conſidered the Expreſſions of the Article barely as they are laid down, and found them obſcure. And as to thoſe things which were told him of them on this Subject, and which he diſapproved, he does not ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify them. When then he adds, <hi>That the Catholick Church holds, the Bread is changed into the Body and Blood of our Lord thro the Spirit.</hi> It is clear his Deſign is without proceeding any farther into the Examination of their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, to tell them that of his Church, and oppoſe it againſt their Article, ſo that we muſt always return to the Inquiry whether by theſe Expreſſions, <hi>The Bread is changed into the real Body,</hi> he means Tranſubſtantiation, or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Change by way of Augmentation, and Impreſſion of Virtue; for 'tis certain, the Article of the <hi>Auſbourg</hi> Confeſſion reſpects neither of theſe Changes.</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> tells us, <hi>This was a proper place wherein to aſſert the Body and</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 361.</note> 
                           <hi>Blood of Chriſt are not really preſent in the Sacrament, ſeeing only their Virtue is in it.</hi> I anſwer, a preſence of Virtue, is a real Preſence of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, even as the Sun is really preſent with us by the Efficacy of its Beams, ſo that <hi>Jeremias</hi> had no reaſon to oppoſe the reality of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; but 'twas better ſaid by him, that the Terms of the Confeſſion were Ambiguous, and that they ought to acknowledg clearly, the Body and Blood are ſubſtantially preſent in it, ſuppoſing he believed this ſubſtantial Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> adds, <hi>That the Patriarch does not ſay the Bread is changed in</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">p. 362.</note> 
                           <hi>Virtue, Power and Efficacy.</hi> I anſwer, neither does he ſay 'tis changed in <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> and there is this Difference betwixt Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> and I, that I add it was not neceſſary that <hi>Jeremias</hi> ſhould explain himſelf touching this change of Virtue, becauſe the <hi>Greeks</hi> who preceded him, had already plainly done it; but the ſame cannot be ſaid touching the change of Subſtance, for not one of the <hi>Greeks</hi> ever mentioned it any more than he, ſo that he was neceſſarily obliged clearly to expreſs it, if he intended it ſhould be underſtood.</p>
                        <p>BUT Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> further ſay's, <hi>The Divines of</hi> Wittemberg, <hi>and</hi> Tubinga, <hi>believed upon the Anſwer of the Patriarch, that he taught the real Preſence and</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">p. 370.</note> 
                           <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> When this were true we need not be aſtoniſhed thereat: For it might well be that Divines who held the Conſubſtantiation ſhould take the Words of <hi>Jeremias</hi> in a Sence which oppoſed only one part of their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, rather than in another which would wholly overthrow it. Their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judication ſignifies nothing, to the Expoſition which the <hi>Greeks</hi> make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their own Opinion.</p>
                        <p>BUT Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſay's moreover, <hi>If the Divines of</hi> Wittemberg <hi>Miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Patriarchs Sence, it lay upon him to rectify their Miſtakes.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, there cannot be any Advantage made of <hi>Jeremias</hi>'s Silence in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. For it is certain that in theſe Divines firſt anſwer, they reckon amongſt the Points in which they agreed with the Patriarch, this, <hi>That the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Supper of our Lord, unites us to him, in as much as we truly partake therein of his Fleſh and Blood:</hi> But theſe were the proper Expreſſions which this Patriarch uſed, and ſo far there was no reaſon to ſay they charged him with believing what he did not, ſeeing they only repeated what he ſaid. It is likewiſe true they denyed the Bread was changed therein, which they grounded on the Teſtimony of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who calls it Bread; yet did they make uſe of the ſame Term <hi>Jeremias</hi> did, which is that of <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, without
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:41961:179"/> the leaſt mention of a change of Subſtance. So that ſo far <hi>Jeremias</hi> had no cauſe to tell 'em they miſtook his Words: Neither does he do it in his Reply or ſecond Anſwer, but ſtill continues to ſay, <hi>The Bread is changed,</hi> without proceeding any farther. It is true, in fine, that the Divines having replyed to <hi>Jeremias</hi> his ſecond Letter, they expreſly oppoſe the change of Subſtance, and ſeem thereby to ſuppoſe they had taken the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> of <hi>Jeremias</hi> in the Sence of a real Tranſubſtantiation, which might then oblige this Patriarch to explain himſelf more clearly than he had done in his former Writings. But it is alſo true that he returned them no particular Anſwer touching the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> He contented himſelf with telling them in general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Sacraments, <hi>That ſeeing they admitted only ſome of them, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over erroneouſly perverted and changed the Expreſſions of the ancient and modern Doctrin to obtain their Aim,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>They therefore deſerved not the Title of Divines.</hi> Which ſufficiently ſhews his Complaint againſt them, for their miſunderſtanding of theſe Terms, in underſtanding them of a change of Subſtance, and at the ſame time certifying them, that for his Part he would not deviate from the general and uſual Expreſſions of his Church.</p>
                        <p>IT is certain there is in theſe Writings of <hi>Jeremias,</hi> ſuch Matters which cannot agree with the Roman Tranſubſtantiation, as that which we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready related when we treated on the real Belief of the <hi>Greeks, That God has given us the Sacraments double, that is to ſay, conſiſting on one Hand of the Grace of the Holy Spirit, and on the other, of ſenſible things, which are Water, Oyl, Bread, and the Chalice by which our Souls are ſanctifi'd;</hi> For a Man that ſpeaks thus, clearly ſhews he underſtands the Subſtance of Bread remains. We may likewiſe reckon in this Rank what he ſays concerning the Church, <hi>That ſhe is ſet forth to us in the Myſteries, not as in the Symbols;</hi> But as the Members are in the <hi>Heart, and the Branches of a Tree in the Root,</hi> or as the Branches <hi>in the Vine according to our Saviour's Words. For here is not only a bare Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Name, or relation of Reſemblance, but the Identity of the thing it ſelf: For the Myſteries are really the Body and Blood of Chriſt, and they are not changed into our Body, but we are changed into them, the ſtrongeſt part prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Iron when put in the Fire, becomes Fire it ſelf, but the Fire becomes not Iron. As then when the Iron is red-hot, we perceive no more Iron, but Fire, the Fire diſpelling all the Proprieties of Iron, ſo he that beholds Chriſt's Church, in as much as it is united to him, and partakes of his Fleſh, beholds nothing elſe but the Body of our Lord.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THIS Diſcourſe is taken <hi>Verbatim</hi> out of <hi>Cabaſilas,</hi> as I have obſerved elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and ſhews the Change of Bread and Wine, muſt not be urged as if they underſtood it of a Change of Subſtance, ſeeing he uſes the ſame Term in reſpect of the Communicants, ſaying, <hi>We are changed into the Myſteries.</hi> They likewiſe ſhew us we muſt not take in a Counter-Sence what he ſay's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Myſteries, being <hi>really the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſeeing he tells us the Church <hi>is the very Body of our Lord.</hi> I alledged theſe laſt Words in my Anſwer to the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> and ſay'd, <hi>That</hi> Jeremias <hi>ſpeaks of the Church which has received the Impreſſion of the Spirit of Chriſt.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> accuſes me of Falſifying this Paſſage: But this Accuſation comes from his being out of Humor. The original Words I recited are theſe <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>he will perceive nothing elſe but our Lord's Body:</hi> And as to what I ſaid, that he ſpeaks of the Church which has received the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Spirit of Chriſt, I affirm this is his Sence, and that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>
                           <pb n="327" facs="tcp:41961:179"/> (as prejudiced as he is) cannot give it any other: For to what relates this Compariſon of Fire which changes the Iron, but to the Impreſſion of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt on the Church, and this Union of the Church with Chriſt, but to his ſpiritual and myſtical Union? It is true he ſay's, <hi>That 'tis in as much as ſhe is partaker of his Fleſh:</hi> But this does not in any ſort change his Sence. For 'tis from the myſtical Participation of his Fleſh that comes the Impreſſion of his Spirit, and it is the Impreſſion of his Spirit which effects this admirable Change. Theſe two things are ſubalternate, but not contrary to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: So that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> impertinently charges me with falſifying the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of <hi>Jeremias.</hi> But it is not the ſame with this other Paſſage which <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſius</hi> alledged, and concerning which I have complained of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> may ſay if he pleaſes, <hi>That my Complaint is unreaſonable;</hi> yet will it be found both Juſt and Reaſonable. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſius</hi> was a Perſon who making outward Profeſſion of the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet wrote in favour of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> under the ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Peace and Agreement. To ſoften what we believe is hard in the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, he aſſures us that almoſt all the <hi>Greeks</hi> believe it, and inſtances <hi>Jeremias</hi> who teaches according to what he ſay's, <hi>That the Bread is neither a Figure, nor an</hi> Azyme, <hi>but the real Body of Chriſt contained under the ſpecies of leavened Bread.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> alledges this <hi>Forbeſius</hi> as a Perſon whoſe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony ought to be of great weight with us, being a Proteſtant. The cauſe then of my Complaint is, that we muſt have a falſe Tranſlation of <hi>Jeremias</hi> impoſed upon us, under the Name of a Proteſtant, without telling us what kind of Man this Proteſtant was. When we make uſe of a Witneſs, we ought certainly to conſider what he is, and if it appears there be juſt Exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, we muſt not offer him; and when we would uſe a Paſſage which he alledges, we muſt take care his Tranſlation be true. It is to no purpoſe to ſay, <hi>We are not obliged to juſtify the Tranſlations of Proteſtants, and that if he be miſtaken 'tis his Fault.</hi> This might be indeed alledged, ſuppoſing the <note place="margin">P. 365.</note> Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> had diſputed againſt <hi>Forbeſius,</hi> or were ignorant who this <hi>Forbeſius</hi> was; but this Mans Character ſufficiently ſhews it ſelf by the bare reading of his Book. Neither does it ſignify any thing to ſay, <hi>That</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſius <hi>is not the Author of this Tranſlation, but Tranſcribed it</hi> Verbatim <hi>from</hi> Socolovius. Neither is it leſs a Deceit in <hi>Forbeſius</hi> himſelf, who ought not to make us Believe that <hi>Jeremias</hi> ſaid what he did not, and when a Perſon that pretends to be of our Communion deceives us, we have right to inveigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Let us come then to the Point, and inquire whether the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of <hi>Jeremias</hi> be falſe. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſay's 'tis not, and I affirm it is: The Queſtion will be decided by the reading of <hi>Jeremias</hi> his own Words. <hi>The Bread,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>of the Lord's Body, which is adminiſtred by the Prieſts, is neither a Type, nor an</hi> Azyme, <hi>but it is</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>a leavened Loaf, and the very Body of our Lord,</hi> and the Tranſlation runs, <hi>Illud ipſum verum Chriſti corpus, ſub ſpeciebus fermentati panis contentum, The Body it ſelf, the real Body of Chriſt CONTAINED UNDER THE SPECIES OF LEAVENED BREAD.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> affirms that this is not a Falſification, becauſe <hi>Jeremias</hi> his true Sence is repreſented in it. For ſay's he, theſe Words, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, are capable of two different <note place="margin">P. 366.</note> Sences. Firſt, This Bread is called <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> 
                           <hi>Leavened, becauſe it remains in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect leavened Bread, and that it is only the Body of Chriſt, in Figure or Virtue. Secondly, It is called by this Name of leavened Bread, becauſe it was originally leavened Bread, and does ſtill appear ſo, altho it be the Body of our Lord. But the</hi>
                           <pb n="328" facs="tcp:41961:180"/> 
                           <hi>firſt of theſe Sences has been ſeveral times excluded by</hi> Jeremias <hi>his own Words, wherein he clearly aſſerted that after the Conſecration the leavend Bread is changed into our Lord's real Body, that it is not a Figure, but our Lords Body, that it is this Fleſh concerning which he ſpeaks; The Bread which I ſhall give you is my Fleſh. It is excluded in what follows ſundry different ways, and by the very Words of that paſſage which aſſerts it is our Lord's Body. Whence it follows it is not then really leavened Bread.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I anſwer, that this pretended Sence which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> attributes to <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mias</hi> is preciſely the Point in Queſtion. Now whilſt a matter is in Diſpute, we muſt never tranſlate a Paſſage according to the Sence of one of the Parties which th'other denies him. To deal ſincerely, the proper and natural Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Terms muſt be kept, and every man left at his liberty to judg of them. For when men tranſlate according to the Pretention of one Party, they are no longer the Words of this Author, but the Prejudication of this Party, and conſequently an Alteration, even when the Prejudication of this Party ſhould be juſt and reaſonable in the Main. Moreover Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is miſtaken, if he believes the other Paſſages of <hi>Jeremias</hi> determine a Sence of ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Reality, for according to the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the Bread ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains Bread in Subſtance, altho it be changed into the Body of Chriſt, and be the very Body of Chriſt, and not a Figure, as we have often already decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whence it follows the Tranſlation in queſtion cannot be juſtified.</p>
                        <p>A Man of never ſo mean Capacity may perceive that <hi>Jeremias</hi> his Sence, is not that which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> attributes to him. For in the ſame place where he ſay's, <hi>The Bread is changed into the real Body of Chriſt, and the Wine into his Blood,</hi> and wherein he alledges the Words of Chriſt which tell us, not, <hi>This is an</hi> Azyme, <hi>or this is the Figure of my Body, but this is my Body;</hi> He adds by way of Explication, <hi>This is not to ſay that the Fleſh which our Saviour then had, was given to be eaten by his Diſciples, nor his Blood to be drunk, nor that now in this ſacred Ordinance our Lord's Body deſcends from Heaven: This would be Blaſphemy. But then and now by Prayers and the Grace of the almighty Spirit, which operates in the Myſteries by means of the Holy Oriſons, the Bread is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into our Lord's real Body and Blood.</hi> Theſe Words being applyed to the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis</hi> of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that the Bread remaining Bread, and receiving the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Holy Spirit, is changed into the Body of Chriſt by way of Augmentation, are clear, and void of Difficulty. But if we apply them to the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the <hi>Latins,</hi> who affirm the Subſtance of Bread is changed into the natural Fleſh of Chriſt, and becomes the Same numerical Fleſh which our Lord had when on Earth; In what Sence ſhall we underſtand that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Jeremias,</hi> namely that the Fleſh which Chriſt had then, was not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to be eaten by his Diſciples? For if we grant Tranſubſtantiation, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Diſciples eat the ſame Fleſh which Chriſt then had, and <hi>Jeremias</hi> his Propoſition can not ſubſiſt. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> endeavours but in vain, to expound <hi>Jeremias</hi> his Diſcourſe in ſaying, <hi>That Chriſt gave not to be eaten by his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples the Fleſh which he had, in ceaſing to have it, and to appear before them in his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual manner, in cutting his Body into Morſels, or having no other place of Abode than his Apoſtles Stomach.</hi> To make us receive this Gloſs, it muſt be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on <hi>Jeremias</hi> his own Words, and not on Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Imagination. Theſe Corrections and fine Explications hinder not, but that the Patriarch's Propoſition is abſolute and contrary to the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation. For that which <hi>Jeremias</hi> denies, is not that our Saviour diſappeared before his Diſciples, nor cut his Fleſh into Morſels, but that he gave them to eat
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:41961:180"/> the Fleſh he then had. The Queſtion reſpects not the manner in which our Lord gave his Fleſh to be eaten, but whether he did give it, and <hi>Jeremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> aſſerts he did not. What likelyhood is there that a Man who believes Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, would thus roughly offer a Negative which is directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to his Belief? What likelyhood is there he would offer it in the ſame place and Diſcourſe wherein he aſſerts Tranſubſtantiation, without explaining, and leſſening the Offence, which might be taken at his Words? But in ſhort, how is it probable he would treat as Blaſphemous the Propoſition contrary to his Negative? Of theſe two Propoſitions, <hi>Chriſt gave to be eaten by his Diſciples the Fleſh he bore, and Chriſt gave not the Fleſh he bare to his Diſciples to eat.</hi> The firſt would be the only true one according to the Letter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gloſs and Commentary, ſuppoſing Tranſubſtantiation. Th'other taken litterally would be falſe and heretical, and to make it tolerable, it muſt have Expoſitions and Molifications contrary to what the Letter bears. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is forced to change the firſt and natural Sence of the Terms, and impoſe on them a forced and unuſual one. Who can then imagine that a Man who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved Tranſubſtantiation, or the real Preſence, and poſitively aſſerted it, ſhould be ſo ſenceleſs as to condemn the firſt of theſe Propoſitions which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly contains his Belief, to condemn it I ſay as Blaſphemous, and eſtabliſh the ſecond as the only true one, without uſing any Corrective or Illuſtration? This is wholly improbable.</p>
                        <p>AND this is what I had to ſay concerning <hi>Jeremias.</hi> There remains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more of all Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s pretended Proofs, than the Paſſages taken out of ſome common Authors, wherein there being nothing extraordinary, and containing only that the Bread is the Body of Chriſt, and that it is changed into his Body: The ſame Anſwer being applyed to them will be ſufficient.</p>

The Queſtion being to know whether theſe Doctrines were ever believed and taught in the Chriſtian Church, and eſpecially in <hi>Greece,</hi> there is no other direct way than that of taking Tradition from the Source, and to paſs on from the firſt Century to the ſecond, from the ſecond to the third, and ſo on
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:41961:181"/> to the laſt. If he thought this Method tedious, he would have done better to have abridged it in ſhewing theſe Doctrines were taught in the firſt ſix Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, and ſuppoſe the ſame in thoſe that followed, than to ſhew them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed from the eleventh and ſeventh, whereby to ſuppoſe the ſame in the ſix foregoing Centuries. To ſpeak ſincerely there ought to be neither of theſe Suppoſitions made; for it does not abſolutely follow from a Point's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing held in the firſt Ages, that it has been likewiſe held in the laſt, neither does it any more follow from a Points being held in the laſt, that it was ſo in the firſt. This does not follow in reſpect of Fact: Yet it is certain that in reſpect of Right, which is far more conſiderable than Fact, 'tis more advantageous to ſhew a Doctrine in the beginnings of Tradition, than in the ſequels of it. For it rather follows from a Doctrine's being held in the beginnings of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it ought to be held ſtill, than it does follow from its being held at preſent, or ſince the eleventh, or ſeventh Century, that it ought to be held, or that it was held in effect in the firſt Ages of the Church. Why then has Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> divided his Tradition into three parts; one ſince the eleventh Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to this preſent, th'other ſince the ſeventh to the tenth, and the third, from the firſt Century to the ſixth, ſeeing Tradition ought to be taken ſucceſſively in order? Why has he in his Diviſion made the laſt part the firſt, ſeeing in effect it is the laſt in order? Why in ſhort, thus injure his Cauſe in ſpending all his time upon the two leaſt important, and which ſignify nothing, as to the main of our Queſtion, and remit the moſt important to another time, when his Conveniency will ſerve him to conſider them? Howſoever we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to follow him every where, and therefore ſhall examine here his ſeventh Book, becauſe it treats ſtill of the Belief of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> For by this means the Readers will ſee in order whatſoever Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has alledged in relation to this Church.</p>
                        <p>THE Publick having nothing to do with our perſonal Quarrels, and the Cauſe which I defend, depending neither on what I am, or am not, I ſhall therefore paſs by all the Invectives with which the firſt Chapter is filled. The firſt thing which appears in it is my Picture, which cannot but be well done, coming from his Hands; for perſons Characters are the chief Weapons Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> and his Friends uſe in their Diſputes. But he may deſcribe me how he pleaſes, for I ſhall not be much moved thereat. Thoſe that read our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, will do us both right I hope. I ſhall only ſay then that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has captiouſly abuſed my Words touching the eight firſt Centuries when I called them, <hi>The Churches happy Days, peaceable and bleſſed Days, wherein the Paſtors took care to instruct their Flocks, and remove all the Difficulties which might ariſe</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Anſwer to the <hi>2d.</hi> Treat. 2, <hi>p. c.</hi> 3.</note> 
                           <hi>from the Sacrament's being commonly called the Body of Chriſt. 1ſt.</hi> I joyned all theſe Centuries together, when I ſpake of them in this ſort, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> only conſiders the two laſt of them, taking no notice of the other ſix, as if what I ſaid of theſe two laſt were to be taken alone and apart. <hi>2dly.</hi> That altho the two laſt are comprehended amongſt the number of the eight, yet I never meant that the Title <hi>of happy Days, Days of Peace and Bleſſing,</hi> belongs equally to all of them. The happy Days have an end, and altho their laſt Hours which draw neareſt to Night, are darker than thoſe which preceded them, yet are we wont to comprehend them amongſt the reſt, under the Name of <hi>happy Day,</hi> becauſe when we diſtribute the Sence of theſe kind of Expreſſions to all the Parts, or Hours; rational Perſons make this Diſtribution proportionably to what each of them deſerves. May not that Perſon be juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly derided for his Impertinency that carps at the calling of <hi>a happy Day</hi> a time wherein there's ſcarcely any longer Light, under pretence that the laſt Hour,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:41961:181"/> which approaches nearer the Night, is darker than the reſt. Now this Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> exactly does, he pretends 'tis impertinently that I call the eight firſt Centuries, <hi>The Churches happy Days,</hi> ſeeing the other Miniſters aſſert the ſeventh and eighth, that is to ſay, the two laſt were Ages of Ignorance and Superſtition. To diſſipate all theſe Subtilties, we need but diſtinguiſh theſe Centuries in two reſpects, in which we may conſider them, either by comparing them with the preceeding, or following Ages. In the firſt they were Ages of Ignorance, and Superſtition. And in the ſecond, they were the laſt Hours of the Churches happy Days, or the approaches of a Night, that is to ſay in one Word, that altho Knowledg and Zeal ſuffered very much Diminution in them, and ſeveral Errors troubled the Purity of Religion, yet this was nothing in compariſon of what followed afterwards. This is the Judgment I think we ought to make of them in general. But in particular, in reſpect of the Myſtery of the Euchariſt, I firmly believe that the Doctrine of the real Preſence and Tranſubſtantiation, were not then eſtabliſhed in the Church during theſe two Centuries; we may indeed meet with ſome hard Expreſſions, and ſuch as are contrary to thoſe of the preceeding Ages, but no ſubſtantial Converſion. We ſhall find the care of inſtructing the People in the ſound Knowledg of the Sacrament greatly ſlackned in compariſon of the preceeding Ages, yet were they not wholy ignorant how the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is the Body of Chriſt; to wit, in that it is the Sacrament or Myſtery of it. It was in this Sence I underſtood the ſeventh and eighth Centuries were compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended amongſt the Churches happy Days. Let any Man judg now what Reaſon Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has to repreſent me as a Perſon, <hi>That never reſpect</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 7. c. 1. p. 614.</note> 
                           <hi>things as they are in Effect, but only as I would have them, that has no regard to Truth, nor Probability, but only the advantaging of my Cauſe, that diſpoſes of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Paſſages and real Events with more liberty than Adventures are dealt out in Romances, that builds Caſtles in the Ayr, and makes all Men in the World Sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, provided they ſpeak and think according to my Deſires and Pretenſions, that prefers the ſmalleſt Reaſons, before the strongeſt and cleareſt Proofs, and propoſes all this in a confident inſulting manner, giving myſelf thoſe Applauſes which I would willingly receive from others, and treating my Adverſaries with Contempt and Diſdain.</hi> And here is the Tempeſt which has followed my Sun-ſhine, <hi>my happy Days.</hi> But I am ſorry Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſhould be thus angry upon no occaſion: Howſoever we will Examine the Paſſages he has offered.</p>
                        <p>THE firſt is a Paſſage taken out of <hi>Anaſtatius Sinaite,</hi> wherein a Monk argues againſt Hereticks who aſſerted Chriſt's Body was incorruptible before his Reſurrection. To prove that it was Corruptible, he takes it for granted by his Adverſaries, <hi>That the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>is really the true Body and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Anaſt. Sin. <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>not mere Bread, ſuch as is ſold in the Market; nor a Figure, ſuch as was the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the paſchal Lamb amongſt the Jews.</hi> To this Principle he adds ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is, <hi>That the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>is corruptible, as Experience ſhews us;</hi> and from theſe two Propoſitions he concludes, <hi>That the Body of Chriſt was Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible before his Reſurrection.</hi> Every Man ſees this Reaſoning is grounded on this Suppoſition, <hi>That the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>is the Body of Chriſt, ſuch as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Reſurrection,</hi> that is to ſay in the ſame State. Now it is likewiſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that this Suppoſition is wholy inconſiſtent with the Doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, and that of the ſubſtantial Preſence. For beſides that, 'tis both fooliſh and impious to imagine that our Lord's Body which is riſen out of its State of Humiliation deſcends into it again, and exiſts ſtill Mortal, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible and Paſſible, as it was heretofore: This is moreover directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his Sacramental State, wherein we muſt neceſſarily ſuppoſe it, if we
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:41961:182"/> would have it to be in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> in proper Subſtance. For it is not to be imagined that a Body which exiſts after the manner of a Spirit impalpable and indiviſible, which can be neither ſeen nor touched, ſhould be at the ſame time Mortal, Corruptible, and Paſſible, as our Saviour's Body was before his Reſurrection: Theſe two States are inconſiſtent with each other; whence it follows that whatſoever otherwiſe the Sence of this Author might be, he held neither Tranſubſtantiation, nor the Reality which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holds.</p>
                        <p>YET if we believe Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> he is a Witneſs for him. For as ſoon as ever he finds in any Paſſage that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is not a Figure, but the true Body of Chriſt, he requires no more for the making of a Proof, altho he ſees otherwiſe ſeveral things abſolutely contrary to him. One of the uſual Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with which he impoſes on his Readers; is, that when he offers any Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage importing what I now mentioned, or ſomething like it, he ſets himſelf to ſhew not that 'tis the Romane Tranſubſtantiation therein contained, but that 'tis not our Doctrine. And thus has he done in that Paſſage of <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi>'s, <hi>Can any Man,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>that has but the leaſt ſpark of Sence, and believes the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 625.</note> Euchariſt <hi>to be only a Figure of Chriſt's Body, and not the real Body of Chriſt, Expreſs this his Opinion by theſe Terms. The</hi> Euchariſt <hi>is not the Figure, but really the true Body of Chriſt. Can any Calviniſt in the World refuſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg this Diſcourſe overthrows his Doctrine?</hi> And I ſay, can there be any Man that has but the leaſt dram of Sence, that believes the Body of Chriſt exiſts in the <hi>Eucharist</hi> after the manner of a Spirit, and is therein in a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental State, and yet expreſſes this his Belief in ſaying the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is ſubject to Corruption; and concluding from thence that the Body of Chriſt was then Corruptible before his Reſurrection? Is there ever a one of Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi>'s Friends that can contain himſelf from believing this Diſcourſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrows his Doctrine? When I ſpeak in this manner, I keep to the State of our Queſtion, and deceive no body; But when Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſpeaks as he does, he wanders from the Point in hand, and deludes his Readers.</p>
                        <p>WHATSOEVER <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> his Doctrine may be, 'tis certain 'tis not that of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which cannot conſiſt with the Principle on which <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> argues. <hi>He expreſſes himſelf,</hi> ſay's Mr. <hi>Arnaud, a little crabbedly towards the end of his Diſcourſe, in making uſe of weak Arguments, not only here, but in almoſt all parts of his whole Diſcourſe.</hi> But if Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> be forced to confeſs that this man's Expreſſions are of hard digeſtion, when applyed to the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> Why may not I as well ſay they are ſo, being applyed to our <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> and conſequently they muſt not be urged againſt us? If <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtaſius</hi> could not carefully conſider the Conſequence he drew himſelf, how could he foreſee that which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would one Day draw from his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe? If it be uſual with <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> to argue weakly, why may it not alſo be uſual with him to Diſcourſe with little foreſight? Why muſt Advantage be taken from ſome of his Expreſſions againſt us, and we withheld from tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any againſt Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> from the whole Sequel of his Diſcourſe, and Coherence of his Thoughts, which a Man more minds than his Terms, or manner of expreſſing himſelf?</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> endeavours, but all in vain, to molify <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi>'s Sence, in ſaying, <hi>That he concludes the Body of Chriſt was corruptible before his Paſſion,</hi>

                           <hi>ſeeing he ſuffers ſtill in the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>an apparent Corruption, by the ſenſible Cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ruption of the Species, which are the Symbol of the State wherein he was before</hi>
                           <pb n="333" facs="tcp:41961:182"/> 
                           <hi>his Death. This Arguing,</hi> adds he, <hi>is very weak and roughly Expreſſed, but 'tis no unuſual thing for this Author to Reaſon weakly, and it would be but a bad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to conclude that an Argument is not his, becauſe 'tis weak. It is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that it be not extravagant in the higheſt Degree, as is that which</hi> Aubertin <hi>attributes to him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>ANASTASIUS</hi> his Argument according to Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> muſt be put in this Form. The Body of Chriſt before his Reſurrection was ſuch, as is in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> the Symbol of the State wherein he was before his Death; But this Symbol is corruptible: Therefore the Body of Chriſt was then Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible. This Argument is like that which Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi> imputes to him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mr. <hi>Arnaud. That which happens to the Figure of Chriſt's Body;</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">P. 629.</note> 
                           <hi>happened to his Body before his Paſſion. Now it happens to the Bread which is the Figure of it, to be ſubject to Corruption: The Body then of Jeſus Chriſt was Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible before his Paſſion.</hi> Take the Word Figure from this Argument, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert that of Symbol, which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has uſed in his, and the two Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are the ſame. Yet he will have his to be good, and Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly Extravagant.</p>
                        <p>BUT, it will be perhaps replyed, theſe two Arguments which in reſpect of Terms are alike, yet do differ in Sence; For Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> by the Symbol, means the Accidents or Species which cover the Body, and Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi> by the Figure underſtands a real Subſtance of Bread. So that howſoever alike theſe Arguments do at firſt appear, one of 'em may be reaſonable, and th'o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Extravagant. I grant all this; but I ſay if Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Argument be good, Mr. <hi>Aubertins</hi> is ſo likewiſe, and that if there be any Extravagancy in either of them, it muſt be in the firſt, and not in the ſecond. Why muſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtaſius</hi> rather argue on the State of the corruptible Species, than on that of the corruptible Bread? His Arguing, take we it how we will, muſt be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on two Qualities attributed to the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> one, <hi>That it is a Sign,</hi> and th'other, <hi>That it is a corruptible Sign,</hi> and from hence he will conclude that Chriſt's Body before his Reſurrection was Corruptible as well as its Sign. Now theſe two Qualities of <hi>Sign</hi> and <hi>Corruptible,</hi> are found as well, or rather better in the <hi>Bread</hi> which <hi>Aubertin</hi> means, than in the <hi>Accidents,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi>'s Species. It will no ways avail to ſay that <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> denies the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt</hi> to be a Figure, and that thus he would contradict himſelf, ſaying on one hand that it is not a Figure, and ſuppoſing on the other that it is one. This I ſay ſignifies nothing, for 'tis only changing the Term of Figure, into that of Symbol, which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> uſes, and which he believed not to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the Rejection of the Word Figure. Neither ſignifies it any thing to ſay <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> aſſures us the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is the real Body, which hinders us from underſtanding by the Term of <hi>Symbol,</hi> contained in his Argument, that 'tis Bread in Subſtance. For I deny that by the true Body he mentions, we muſt underſtand the Body in proper Subſtance. It is then certain that if we may attribute Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Argument to this Author, we may as well attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to him that of Mr. <hi>Aubertin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT I ſay moreover, that if there be any Extravagancy in either of theſe two Arguments, it will be found to be rather in that which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes to him, than the other: Which we ſhall ſoon find if we conſider what means in <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> his Diſcourſe the Term of <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> according to Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Commentary; for it ſignifies, the <hi>Incorruptible Body, Inviſible and Impaſſible of Chriſt, under the Corruptible Species of Bread and Wine. Anaſtaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
                           <pb n="334" facs="tcp:41961:183"/> then will Reaſon after this manner, <hi>The Body of Chriſt before his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was immediately Corruptible in it ſelf.</hi> Why? <hi>Becauſe now in the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>it is Incorruptible in it ſelf, and Corruptible in reſpect of the Species which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it.</hi> Was ever ſuch abſurd Arguing known? Would not the Heretick <hi>Gayanite</hi> ſay the contrary hence followed; for ſeeing our Lord is Incorruptible in himſelf in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> this is a Token he was ſo before his Reſurrection. And as to the Species, being only Appearances of Bread, the Corruption which happens to them, is no more than an appearance of Corruption, which can at fartheſt but figurate an apparent Corruption in our Lord's Body before his Reſurrection; which does not differ from the Doctrine of theſe Hereticks. Moreover <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> eſtabliſhes in his Argument this Principle, <hi>That an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Nature can neither be Cut, nor Wounded in the Side and Hands, nor Pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor put to Death, nor Eaten; That it can neither be held, nor touched.</hi> Now is it not a moſt extream folly to ſtrengthen this by inſtancing the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> that is to ſay the real Body of Chriſt which is Cut, Pierced, Chewed, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Appearances which cover it, and which are yet incorruptible. For this is juſt as if a Man ſhould prove 'tis Night in pointing to the Sun ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In effect, if we introduce the Heretick defending himſelf againſt <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſius</hi> his Propoſition, by the Example of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and ſaying, I diſtinguiſh an incorruptible Nature can neither be Hurt, nor Cut, nor Pierced, nor put to Death, immediately and really in it ſelf: I acknowledg it, in reſpect of the Appearances which cover it, and I prove my Negative by the Example of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> wherein the Body of Chriſt wholy incorruptible as it is, is yet Cut, Chewed, Pierced, in reſpect of the Appearances which are to it inſtead of a Vail. Should (I ſay) the Heretick be brought in Diſputing againſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtaſiu</hi>'s Principle in this manner, he would make a very juſt and reaſonable Anſwer, whence it appears that this Example of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> if taken in the Sence Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> gives it, is an extravagancy and Folly in <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> his own Mouth.</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> then may be pleaſed to acknowledg that he cannot rely on this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> neither juſtify the other Evaſion; which is, <hi>That</hi> Anaſtaſius <hi>believed this whiteneſs, and other ſenſible Accidents of the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>to be the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 631.</note> 
                           <hi>Accidents of the Body of Chriſt, and ſo that when the Bread is broken, it is the Body of Chriſt that is broken.</hi> By the Body of Chriſt Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> underſtands not the Myſtical Body only, but the Natural Body in proper Subſtance. Now what greater Extravagancy can we charge a Man with, than to impute to him the Belief, that the Subſtance of the Body is in Effect, of the ſame Form, and Figure as the Bread in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> that 'tis divided, and broken in ſeveral Particles, as the Bread is divided; that each Particle is a part of this Body, and that the Subſtance of this Body has really the Savour and Colour which Bread has? And ſeeing we muſt believe the Concomitancy, in the ſame manner as the Subſtance of Bread will be liquid, and fluid as Wine in the Cup, ſo that of the Blood will be in the other Species, hard and ſolid as Bread. In Truth, if <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> could have this Sentiment, we muſt ſay he was a Perſon unfit to be inſtanced in this Diſpute, add Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> cannot render him more contemptible than in attributing to him ſuch kind of Fooleries. What he alledges concerning <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that he believed the Divinity had a Body, is lyable to be queſtioned. There are abundance of Paſſages in this Author which will not ſuffer us to entertain ſuch a Thought of him, and which oblige us to expound in a good Sence what he has otherwiſe expreſſed a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle roughly. <hi>Theodoret</hi> makes the <hi>Euthychiens</hi> fall into Contradictions it is true, but they are different from the Extravagancy with which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>
                           <pb n="335" facs="tcp:41961:183"/> charges <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> for they do not immediately diſcover themſelves, whereas th'others preſently manifeſt themſelves. In ſhort, if Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> cannot make uſe and advantage of his Authors, unleſs he accuſe them firſt of Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and afterwards excuſe them by Example of the Extravagancies of others: Let me tell him, he muſt get better Witneſſes, and not think to weary us out with the Language of Perſons, who neither know what they ſay, nor what they believe.</p>
                        <p>WAS there ever any thing more impertinent than <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> imputes to him be true? He concludes that the Body of Chriſt was corruptible before his Reſurrection (that is to ſay) whilſt he was in the World, becauſe it is corruptible in the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> Now to the end his State in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> may be of Conſequence, to that wherein he was before his Reſurrection; It follows that when he was in the World, he was in it under the Senſible Accidents of Bread, intirely ſuch as he is in the <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> Which is to ſay, that when he Talked, Walked, and Converſed, he did all theſe things under the form of Bread. For unleſs this be ſo, there can be no Conſequence drawn from one to the other. <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> could not have denyed that the incorruptible Body of Chriſt could not take on it a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Form, ſeeing he knew that this Body is now incorruptible in Heaven, and that yet according to the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> attributes to him, it becomes every Day corruptible in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> which cannot be but by changing its Form. It muſt needs be then that <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> ſuppoſed the Body of Chriſt was in the World, in the ſame Form 'tis now in the Sacrament, for ſuppoſing it changes its Form, I underſtand not the Concluſion. The Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick <hi>Gaynite</hi> might ſtill alledg, that as it does not follow this Body is corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Heaven, altho it be ſo in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> neither does it follow that it was corruptible during the time he was on Earth; and that 'tis the Form he takes upon him in the Sacrament that renders him corruptible. And thus <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſius</hi> his Argument concludes nothing, unleſs we ſuppoſe Chriſt's Body had abſolutely the ſame Form when he was converſant on Earth, that it has now in the Sacrament. Now this Suppoſition being the greateſt Degree of Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (there being no Man of Sence that will own it,) we may eaſily then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what Judgment to make of <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> handles him.</p>
                        <p>BUT 'tis certain by what I now ſaid that <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> believed neither Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, nor the real Preſence, for had he believed it, he would never have reaſoned as he does, nor ſuppoſed (as he has done) a Principle altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inconſiſtent with the Romane Doctrine.</p>
                        <p>BUT what is then this Author's Sence? I anſwer, that when he ſay's the <hi>Eucharist</hi> is not <hi>common Bread, ſuch as is ſold in the Market:</hi> His meaning is manifeſt; to wit, that it is conſecrated Bread; when he adds, <hi>That it is not a Figure as that of the He-goat, which the Jews offered:</hi> It is clear he does not abſolutely reject the Figure, but in the Sence of a legal Figure, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented Chriſt only obſcurely and imperfectly, whereas the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is a Myſtery, which clearly and perfectly repreſents the whole <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of Chriſt's Incarnation, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> himſelf acknowledges, <hi>That altho the</hi> Greeks <hi>deny the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>to be the Figure of Chriſt's Body, yet do they affirm it</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 630.</note> 
                           <hi>is a Repreſentation of the Myſteries of his Life, and that the ſame Authors which teach the one, teach the other.</hi> So that ſo far, there is nothing in <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi>'s Diſcourſe but what is eaſy. When he adds, <hi>That it is the real Body of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> He means that it is the Myſtery of his Natural Body, which not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:41961:184"/> is ſo perfect a Repreſentation of it, that one may ſay it is the true Body, and not a Figure; but which even has received the ſupernatural Form thereof, or if you will, the Character of it, which is its Virtue, in the ſame Sence that we ſay of Wax, which has received the Impreſſion of the King's Seal, that it is his real Seal. If we find any roughneſs in this Expreſſion, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> finds the ſame in the Sequel of his Diſcourſe, and that we have ſhewed that what he calls Roughneſs is meer Abſurdity. Whence it follows that it is more reaſonable to ſuffer that which is only a bare Rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Offenſiveneſs in the Terms, and which moreover does well agree with <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> his Reaſoning, than that wherein common Sence is not to be found. We muſt likewiſe remember the Expoſition which the <hi>Greeks</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do give to theſe kind of Expreſſions, that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is the true Body, the Body it ſelf, the proper Body of Chriſt; to wit, inaſmuch as it is an Augmentation thereof which makes not another Body, but is the ſame, as we have already ſhewed in the foregoing Book. We muſt know, in fine, that the <hi>Eutychiens</hi> againſt whom <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> Diſputes were wont to attribute to Chriſt in their Diſcourſes when urged, no other than a phantaſtical and imaginary Body, and not a real humane Body, which obliged <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> to ſay that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is the real Body of Chriſt, that is to ſay, the Myſtery, not of a chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical, but real Body.</p>
                        <p>THIS being thus cleared up, the Sence of <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> his Argument lyes open before us. He means, that ſeeing the Bread is a Myſtery in which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the whole <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of Chriſt's Incarnation, being as it is corruptible, it muſt neceſſarily be concluded, that the Body of Chriſt was in like manner corruptible before his Reſurrection, becauſe the Bread was the Myſtery of the Body before its Reſurrection, and that the ſame <hi>Oeconomy</hi> which was obſerved touching the natural Body, whil'ſt it was in the World, is obſerved in the Bread. Let but <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> his Diſcourſe be compared with that of <hi>Zonaras,</hi> which I related in the ninth Chapter of the foregoing Book, and <hi>Damaſcen</hi>'s in the ſhort Homily which I likewiſe mentioned in the Chapter touching the Belief of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and with what I ſaid in the eighth Chapter of this Book, for the explaining <hi>Cabaſilas</hi> his Sence, and there will appear no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in it.</p>
                        <p>AS to that other Paſſage of <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> propoſed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Author diſputes againſt an Heretick called <hi>Timotheus,</hi> who affirmed <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 634.</note> the Nature of Chriſt after the Incarnation, to be the only Divinity. We muſt make the ſame Judgment of it as the former. For as to what he ſay's, <hi>That the Divinity cannot be Detained, Chewed, Divided, Changed, Cut,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as is the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>and that we muſt according to this Hereticks Doctrine deny the</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt <hi>to be in truth Chriſt's viſible, terreſtial, and created Body and Blood;</hi> He means that the Accidents which happen to the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> being in no wiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Divinity of Chriſt who is not ſubject to Change and Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but only to his Body, we muſt therefore ſay the Bread does not paſs through the ſame <hi>Oeconomy</hi> under which our Saviour paſſed; whence it follows that it could not be ſaid as it is, that the Bread was in truth the Body and Blood of Chriſt, being ſaid to be ſo only upon the account of the Unity and Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of this <hi>Oeconomy.</hi> Had he believed Tranſubſtantiation, how could he miſs telling his Adverſary, 'tis not to be imagined the Subſtance of Bread is really changed into the very Subſtance of the Divinity, and that he muſt of neceſſity either deny what the whole Church believes; to wit, the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Subſtance of Bread, or fall into this other Abſurdity of maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:41961:184"/> that this Converſion is made in the Divine Nature? Common Sence leads him to this, and yet we find no ſuch thing in all his Diſcourſe.</p>
                        <p>AFTER <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> comes <hi>Germain</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi> has placed him according to the common Opinion in the eighth Century; but in effect, there is more likelyhood, according to <hi>Allatius</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that he lived in the twelveth, and the Reflections Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> makes on this Subject, ſeem to me juſt enough to be followed till we have greater Certainty. But howſoever this Author ſay's no more than, <hi>That the Bread is changed into the Body of Chriſt, and that it is his Body.</hi> To which we have <note place="margin">Lib. 7. c. 3.</note> ſo often already anſwered that it will be needleſs to ſay any more. Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> ſets to Phyloſophiſing on ſome Paſſages which Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi> alledged in his Favour, but this is an Illuſion; for when what Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi> alledges concerning <hi>Germane</hi> to ſhow that 'tis contrary to Tranſubſtantiation, ſhould not be Concluſive, 'twould not thence follow he believed it, nor Taught it, if this does not appear elſewhere from good Proofs, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to produce ſuch, without ſuppoſing it is ſufficient he Refutes Mr. <hi>Auber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>'s Conſequences: For Refuting is not Proving.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>GERMAIN</hi> ſufficiently ſhews us towards the end of his Treatiſe, in what Sence he underſtood the Bread to be the Body of Chriſt. <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſay's <note place="margin">Germ. Theor. rer. Eccleſ ſub finem.</note> he, <hi>ſprinkling the People with the Blood of Goats and Heifers,</hi> ſaid, <hi>This is the Blood of the Covenant. But our Saviour Chriſt has given his own proper Body, and ſhed his own Blood, and given us the Cup of the new Teſtament;</hi> ſaying, <hi>This is my Body which was broken for you, this is my Blood ſhed for the Remiſſion of your Sins. As often then as ye eat this Bread and drink of this Cup, ye declare my Death and Reſurrection. Thus believing then we eat the Bread and drink of the Cup, as of the Fleſh of God, declaring thereby the Death and Reſurrection of our Lord Jeſus Christ.</hi> We have already obſerved in the foregoing Book, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> do often uſe this Expreſſion, <hi>As the Fleſh, As the Body,</hi> to molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy and abate in ſome ſort their uſual way of ſpeaking, which is, that the Bread is the Body of Chriſt, and to ſignify that the Bread is to us inſtead of this Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. It appears from the ſequel of <hi>Germain</hi>'s Diſcourſe, his Sence is, that for the better applying our Minds to the Death and Reſurrection of our Lord, we eat the Bread and drink of the Cup, in the ſtead of his Body and Blood.</p>
                        <p>AS to <hi>John Damaſcen,</hi> the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> having alledged him as a Witneſs of the Doctrine of the ancient Church. I ſaid, <hi>He ought not</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Anſwer to the <hi>2d.</hi> Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpet. c.</hi> 2.</note> 
                           <hi>to produce the Teſtimony of a Perſon whom we except againſt, and that with good Cauſe, ſeeing he was one of the firſt that left the common Road of the Churches Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and betook himſelf to affected and ſingular ones, which are at as great diſtance from the Roman Church as the reformed one.</hi> Now this Exception is ſo juſt in reſpect of the Queſtion concerning the Sentiment of the ancient Church, that excepting Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> I do not believe there is any Man, how little Converſant ſoever in the Writings of the Fathers, but grants it. For all the Ancient Fathers term the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> a Figure or Repreſentation of our Lord's Body, and <hi>Damaſcen</hi> not only deny's that it is one, but alſo that the Fathers thus termed it after Conſecration. He is one of the firſt that brought into Credit the Compariſon of Food which changes it ſelf into our Bodies, whereby to explain the Change which happens to the Bread, in as much as it is made an Augmentation of the Body of Chriſt, that of the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin which the Holy Spirit overſhadowed, and that of Wood united to the Fire. His Expreſſions being compared with thoſe of the Ancients, are wholly extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary.
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:41961:185"/> He tells us that the Sacramental Bread, and the Body born of the Virgin, are but one and the ſame Body, becauſe the Bread is an Augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Body, and that the ſame <hi>Oeconomy</hi> has been obſerved in both. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Damaſcen</hi> was not the firſt that had theſe kind of Conceptions, ſeeing we have met with ſomething like this in <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> his Diſcourſe, and if I miſtake not, ſome Trace of this in <hi>Gregory de Nyſſes</hi> his Catechiſm; but howſoever it muſt be acknowledged I had reaſon to call theſe Conceptions <hi>Affected</hi> and <hi>Singular</hi> in reſpect of the uſual Expreſſions of the Fathers, and to ſay, they vary as much from the Doctrine of the Romane Church as ours.</p>
                        <p>YET to hear only Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> a Man would imagine that <hi>Damaſcen</hi> clearly taught Tranſubſtantiation. To prove it he alledges theſe ſame Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of his fourth Book touching the true Orthodox Faith wich has been a thouſand times canvaſs'd by Controvertiſts, and which conclude nothing. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcen</hi> ſay's, <hi>That God makes the Bread the Body of Chriſt, and the Wine his Blood, that it is an effect of his Almighty Power, which has created all things; that ſeeing the Lord took his Body from the pure and immaculate Blood of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, we muſt not doubt but he can change the Bread into his Body, and the Wine into his Blood; that if we demand how this Change happens, he anſwers, that this is wrought by the Holy Spirit, that the Word of God is True and Almighty; but that the manner is Incomprehenſible. But yet it may be rationally ſay'd, that as the Bread and Wine (wherewith a Man is nouriſhed) are changed into his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo that they become another Body than that which they were before; ſo the Bread and Wine mixt with Water, are changed into the Body and Blood of Chriſt in awonderful manner, by Prayer and Deſcent of the Holy Spirit, and that they are not two different Bodies, but one and the ſame Body.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>HAD not <hi>Damaſcen</hi> expreſſed himſelf as he has done, it would be to no purpoſe for us to tell Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> the Change he ſpeaks of is not Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, ſeeing his Sence is that the Bread becomes a growth of our Lord's Body, and is made by this means one with this Body, that this is the effect he attributes to the Holy Spirit, and Almighty Power of God, acting above Nature, and not that of a real Converſion of the Subſtance of Bread into the ſame Subſtance which the Body had before: Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would not fail to term this Extravagancy and Dotage. But ſeeing we ſay no more in this matter than what is grounded on <hi>Damaſcen</hi>'s own Words, as it appears by what we related when we treated on the real Belief of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> This Illuſtration will be ſufficient, without proceeding any farther, to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant this long Chapter which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has written touching the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocal Expreſſions of this Author. In effect, let him ſay as long as he pleaſes, <hi>That the Point here concerns neither Figure nor Virtue, that this effect</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 7. c. 3. p. 650. 651.</note> 
                           <hi>which ſurpaſſes humane Conception is in</hi> Damaſcen'<hi>s Sence this;</hi> to wit, <hi>That the Bread is made the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, that it is the Body really united to the Divinity, the Body taken from the Virgin, becauſe the Bread and Wine are chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Body and Blood of God. That</hi> Damaſcen <hi>ſpeaks of it as if he deſigned to refute expreſly all the Attempts and Shifts of the Miniſters, ſome of whom turn his Words into a change of Virtue, and others to an Imaginary Union of the Holy Siprit, with the Bread remaining Bread. That the Fathers have expreſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after two different manners, that is to ſay, ſometimes as Philoſophers, and otherwhiles as Divines.</hi> All this ſignifies nothing, conſidering the Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which <hi>Damaſcen</hi> himſelf hath given us of his own Sence, in his Letter to <hi>Zacharias</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Doarus,</hi> and Homily at the end of it. Theſe two Pieces publiſhed by the Abbot <hi>Billius,</hi> and which were acknowledged for

                        <argument>
                           <p>An Examination of the Advantages which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> draws from the two Councils held in <hi>Greece</hi> in the eighth Century, upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Images, the one at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and th'other at <hi>Nice.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IT cannot without doubt but trouble good People to ſee how Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſuffers his Pen to be guided by his Paſſion, and fills up his Book with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, ſo ill becoming a Man of his Age and Profeſſion; making them continually the Subject of his Eloquence: Yet in truth are we obliged to him for this way of proceeding, not only for that thereby he gives us Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to exerciſe our Chriſtian Patience, but does alſo himſelf furniſh us with an aſſured means of bringing his Chapters into a leſſer Compaſs. And to this end we ſhall paſs by all his perſonal Reflections as Matters which concern not our Diſpute. Let us then conſider thoſe four terrible Chapters wherein he Treats of the two Councils which were held in the eighth Century, the one at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> againſt Images, and the other at <hi>Nice</hi> for them.</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> begins with the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> that is to ſay with a Writing <note place="margin">Lib. 7. c. 5. p. 661.</note> which the Fathers of this Council cauſed to be read in the ſixth Seſſion, from whence he forms theſe five Propoſitions. <hi>1ſt. That the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>was not called by the Name of Image or Figure, by the Apoſtles and Fathers after Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration. 2dly. That they have called it the Body it ſelf, and the Blood it ſelf. 3dly. That the Gifts are properly Body and Blood. 4ly. That they are not Images, but Body and Blood. 5ly. That it is impoſſible they ſhould be both the Image and Body of Chriſt, ſo that being the Body, they are not the Image.</hi> He moreover tells us that <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> made uſe of the ſame Reaſoning to ſhew the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is not an Image. That <hi>John Damaſcen</hi> likewiſe uſed it, and <hi>Nicephorus</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> concludes after the ſame manner, that the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist</hi> is not the Image of Chriſt, becauſe it is his Body. Whereupon Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> cries out, <hi>Theſe are the very things wherein Arguments are uſeleſs, and wherein the Impreſſion of Truth appears ſo plainly, that thoſe that deny it are</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">P. 663.</note> 
                           <hi>to be regarded as Perſons no longer to be reaſoned with.</hi> But how clear ſoever his Motives may be, we can aſſure him this comes from his Prejudice, and not from the Truth. The Underſtanding of all theſe Diſcourſes of the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the <hi>Iconoclaſtes,</hi> depends only on the knowing in what Sence they meant the <hi>Euchariſt is properly the Body and Blood of Chriſt.</hi> For this Point being once diſpatched, we ſhall ſoon perceive why they denyed it was an Image, and wherefore they thus reaſoned, that being an Image, it could not be the Body.
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:41961:186"/> We muſt obſerve all theſe <hi>Greeks</hi> have followed the Opinion of <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcen,</hi> and ſpeak as he does; that they borrow all his Conceptions and Expreſſions, as appears by the Writing which was read in the ſecond Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice,</hi> by the Fragment of <hi>Theodorus Graptus,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s own Author <hi>Nicephorus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>NOW after the Notices <hi>Damaſcen</hi> has given us, we can no longer doubt but their Sence is, that the Bread and Wine are made the Body and Blood of Chriſt, inaſmuch as that receiving the Supernatural Virtue of this Body and Blood, they are a Growth and Augmentation thereof, and therefore are not two Bodies, but one and the ſame Body, the proper Body of Chriſt, as the Food becomes our proper Body.</p>
                        <p>AND this will appear from the bare reading of a Paſſage in <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Allat. de Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. Occid. &amp; Orient. Perp. Conſenſ. Lib. 3. cap. 15.</note> which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> himſelf has related and taken from <hi>Allatius: And if it be needful,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>to explain theſe things, by what paſſes in our ſelves, as the Bread, Wine, and Water are naturally changed into the Body and Blood of thoſe that eat and drink them, and become not another Body, ſo theſe Gifts by the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of him that Officiates, and Deſcent of the Holy Spirit are changed ſupernatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the Body and Blood of Chriſt. For this is the Contents of the Priest's Prayer, and we do not underſtand they are two Bodies; but we believe it be but one and the ſame Body.</hi> And this is the <hi>Greeks Hypotheſis,</hi> the Bread is made the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Body of Chriſt, as the Meat we eat becomes our Body; to wit, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it is united to it, and receives its Form, increaſes and augments it.</p>
                        <p>THE ſame will appear if we compare the Diſcourſes of the Fathers of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with the Cenſure paſt on them in the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> The Fathers of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> called the <hi>Euchariſt, a choſen Matter, a Subſtance of Bread.</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Nice</hi> were not offended thereat; Neither at the others calling the <hi>Euchariſt, Bread filled with the Holy Spirit, an Oblation tranſlated from a common State, to a State of Holyneſs, a Body made Divine by a Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Grace:</hi> So far they agree. But when the Fathers of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> call the Bread <hi>an Image,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Nice</hi> could not ſuffer it, neither could they bear with them in ſaying it is the Body <hi>by Inſtitution.</hi> Why do they make this Difference, but becauſe theſe firſt Expreſſions which are contrary to Tranſubſtantiation and the ſubſtantial Preſence, yet do not contradict their <hi>Hypothefis</hi> of <hi>Augmentation</hi> by an Impreſſion of Virtue, whereas the others oppoſe it? For they do not ſay the Food is the <hi>Image</hi> of our Body, nor our Body by <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> but that it becomes our <hi>Proper</hi> Body, not <hi>another;</hi> but the <hi>ſame</hi> we had before.</p>
                        <p>THIS Point being thus cleared up, it is eaſy to perceive why theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons deny'd the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to be an Image. For it was not becauſe they believed the Subſtance of Bread did not remain, or imagined it 'twas abſolutely and by a numerical Identity (as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſpeaks) the ſame ſubſtance of the Natural Body; but becauſe they believed that the Bread keeping its proper Subſtance became the proper Body of our Lord by this way of Growth or Augmentation, in receiving the Impreſſion of his Supernatural Virtue, ſo that in this Reſpect it was the ſame thing with them, whether the Bread was <hi>Virtually</hi> the Body of Chriſt, or <hi>properly.</hi> They found then that the ſimple Notion of <hi>Image</hi> was inconſiſtent with that of Propriety, and thereupon
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:41961:186"/> denyed the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to be an Image or Repreſentation.</p>
                        <p>THEY Argued from the ſame Principle, when they ſaid 'tis not poſſible theſe Gifts could be both, <hi>The Body, and the Image of the Body, and being the Body, they could not be the Image of them.</hi> For they believed the Term of <hi>Image</hi> excluded this <hi>propriety of Virtue</hi> which they eſtabliſhed, and that to call them Image, was to regard them in no other manner than that wherein they were before their Conſecration.</p>
                        <p>IT is eaſy to perceive that their Arguing on the Diſcourſe of the Fathers of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> is but a mere Sophiſm.

                        </p>
                        <p>I Anſwer <hi>Nicephorus</hi> his Sence is, that to exclude the Notion of Image, <hi>we muſt ſay it is the thing it ſelf:</hi> And on the contrary to eſtabliſh it, there muſt be no means left to ſay, <hi>it is the thing it ſelf.</hi> Now altho the Son hath the ſame Nature and Eſſence as the Father, yet we cannot ſay he is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for they are different Perſons: So the Son may be well called the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Father.

                        <p>BUT to proceed, I ſay it is not ſufficient to ſhew what the Fathers taught concerning Baptiſm and Oyl; it muſt be ſhewed that <hi>Nicephorus</hi> and the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> have expreſly called them <hi>Images of the Holy Spirit,</hi> for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe there can be nothing concluded in reſpect of them. <hi>They knew,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>that they are the Figure of the Holy Spirit according to the Fathers.</hi> But they might likewiſe as well know that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is the Figure, and Image of the Body of Chriſt according to the Fathers, and yet they for all that deny it, and affirm none of the Fathers ſo term it after Conſecration. Moreover <hi>Nicephorus</hi> and the Fathers of <hi>Nice</hi> may tell him, that whatſoever Virtue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies Baptiſm and Oyl, yet they are not made the Growth of the Holy Spirit, as the Bread and Wine of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> are made the Growth of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, and conſequently they are not Virtually the ſame thing.</p>
                        <p>WHAT Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> adds, <hi>That they themſelves made uſe of the Miracles</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                           <hi>wrought by Images, to eſtabliſh the Worſhip of them, and that the Author of the Theory of Eccleſiaſtical Matters,</hi> ſay's, <hi>That the unconſecrated Bread, which is the Type of the Virgin</hi> Mary'<hi>s Body, communicated to thoſe that participated of it an ineffable Benediction.</hi> This I ſay, does not deſerve an Anſwer, for it does not appear theſe People ever attributed to Images a ſupernatural Virtue, ordinarily reſiding in them, which might make them ſay that the Images are changed into the Virtue of Chriſt, or his Saints; much leſs that the Image is a Growth of Chriſt or his Saints. And as to the Bread which according to <hi>Germain</hi> is the Type of the Virgin <hi>Marry</hi>'s Body, the ineffable Benediction which he ſay's it communicates, is not the Virtue of the Virgin's Body, of which it is the Type.</p>
                        <p>NEITHER does it in fine, ſignify any thing to ſay, <hi>That the Figure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">P. 665.</note> 
                           <hi>it ſelf to the Original, and not to the Virtue; that it is oppoſite to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, that 'tis from the Original from which 'tis diſtinguiſhed, that when it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of Virtue, it is by Accident, and that 'tis every whit as ridiculous to ſay a Figure ceaſes to be a Figure, becauſe it becomes Efficacious, as to ſay a Statue ceaſes to be a Statue when it is gilt.</hi> For it is true that the firſt and moſt natural Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is between the Figure and the Original, and that the Figure is only oppoſed to the Virtue, inaſmuch as that by the Impreſſion of Virtue, a thing becomes in ſome ſort the Original in a proper Sence. Thus the Food we eat becomes in ſome ſort in a proper Sence the Body we had before, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho it be in effect of a diſtinct Subſtance, or Matter, ſeeing it is not the ſame Subſtance, or the ſame Matter in number, but an addition to our former Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, yet do we oppoſe it to the Figure, and ſay 'tis not the Image of our Body, but our Body, our proper Body, the very Body which we had before and not another. Now it is thus the Fathers of <hi>Nice</hi> oppoſe the Figure to the Euchariſtical Bread, and ſay it ceaſes to be a Figure; to wit, then when by the Impreſſion of the ſupernatural Virtue of our Lord's Body it becomes
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:41961:188"/> this proper Body, not another, as we have already a thouſand times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>
                        <p>AND this is what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has ſaid of moſt Moment touching the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and other Adverſaries of the <hi>Iconoclaſtes.</hi> What he after adds conſiſts only in Repetitions, or Matters of ſmall Importance, and <note place="margin">Lib. 7. c. 6. p. 678.</note> which may be eaſily Refuted by his own Words. For Example, what he ſay's touching the Water of Baptiſm, and Oyl, that they are Figures which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Virtue, is an Objection he has ſeveral times made, and which we have already anſwered. What he ſay's touching <hi>the State of an Image, that it has</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">C. 6. p. 674.</note> 
                           <hi>not any Inconſiſtency in it ſelf, neither Real nor Apparent, with a Conſecration which would fill the Bread and Wine with the Virtue of Chriſt's Body,</hi> has been already refuted; For in the Sence of the <hi>Greeks</hi> the State of Image is Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, with what the Bread and Wine become by the Impreſſion they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the Virtue of Chriſt's Body, becauſe they become in a certain Sence, the proper Body and Blood of Chriſt. So that whatſoever Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſay's in general touching the two States, the one <hi>Conſiſtent,</hi> and the other <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent,</hi> has no Foundation. We know there are Conſiſtent and Inconſiſtent States; but the Queſtion is whither the <hi>Greeks</hi> might not believe without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Extravagant and Senceleſs, that there was an Inconſiſtency between theſe two Expreſſions, <hi>The</hi> Euchariſt <hi>is the Image of the Body of Chriſt, and the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>is the proper Body of Chriſt,</hi> altho they underſtood a Propriety by an Impreſſion of Virtue. I confeſs there is not between theſe two States of Image, and proper Body in the Sence wherein thoſe of <hi>Nice</hi> underſtood them, a real Inconſiſtancy; But we muſt likewiſe acknowledg that there is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent one, eſpecially when 'tis made to conſiſt only in the Terms, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve theſe <hi>Greeks</hi> have made it. If Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will have them make it to conſiſt in the ſame thing, beſides that this Difference will be of ſmall Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as to the Main, I need only offer him what himſelf has told us concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> and others, who denyed the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> was a Figure. <hi>That</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 7. c. 2. p. 630.</note> 
                           <hi>theſe were not two inconſiſtent Principles, nor two contrary Expreſſions in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of thoſe Times, to ſay that the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>is not the Figure of Chriſt's Body, and yet a Repreſentation of the Myſteries of his Life, and that the ſame Authors that teach the one, teach us likewiſe the other.</hi> I need only tell him that in the ſame Place wherein they earneſtly deny the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to be an Image, they acknowledg it is a Symbol, and that <hi>Damaſcen</hi> himſelf who will not ſuffer it to be called an Image or Type, yet aſſures us that the ſame <hi>Oeconomy</hi> which was obſerved in Chriſt's natural Body, is obſerved in the Bread; which eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheth a true Reſemblance at bottom. I need only offer him the Expoſition <hi>Beſſarion</hi> makes of <hi>Damaſcen</hi>'s Words. <hi>By the Figure,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>he means a</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Beſſarion de de Sacram. Euchariſt.</note> 
                           <hi>Shadow which is no more than a Figure barely ſignifying another Subject,</hi> yet without having any Subſtance for acting.</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> anſwering this Paſſage of <hi>Beſſarion,</hi> which I offered againſt the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> ſay's, <hi>That</hi> Beſſarion <hi>had reaſon to ſay St.</hi> John Damaſcen, <hi>in denying the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>to be a Figure, means a bare Figure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">C. 6. p. 680.</note> 
                           <hi>Efficacy. Not that he pretends an efficacious Figure is not a Figure; but he ſuppoſes to ſay the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>is the Sign of Jeſus Chriſt, and not his Body; is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as to ſay it is a bare Figure without Virtue and Efficacy, becauſe the Quality of a Figure does not include any Virtue, and that it would have no other which could give it this Virtue. So that according to</hi> Beſſarion <hi>'tis certain that</hi> Damaſcen <hi>in denying the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>to be a Figure of Jeſus Christ, means by the Word Figure a Shadow, and a Figure without Efficacy, becauſe that in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>
                           <pb n="345" facs="tcp:41961:188"/> 
                           <hi>if the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>be a bare Figure, it would be a Figure without Efficacy, and there would be no place of Scripture which could prove this Efficacy, as we will ſhew elſewhere. This Propoſition then is true in one Sence, if the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>were but a Figure, it would be but an empty Figure. But this is not true in any Sence, ſeeing if the Figure were an Efficacious Figure, it would not be a Figure.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>HE means it is impoſſible to attribute any Virtue to the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> if it be not acknowledged the Body of Chriſt in Subſtance. But <hi>1ſt.</hi> This Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is falſe in it ſelf, and the contrary may be proved by an Inſtance from Scripture, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>The Power of God to Salvation, Rom.</hi> 1. And by the Example of Baptiſm, which is accompanied with the Virtue of Chriſt's Blood, and which according to the Scripture is the Laver of our Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In effect, to apply to us the ſupernatural Virtue of the Body of Chriſt, it is not neceſſary that the Subſtance of this Body be locally in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> it is ſufficient that his Spirit be in it, and operates therein. <hi>2ly.</hi> It is falſe, there is no Paſſage of Scripture whereby to prove this Efficacy. That which our Saviour himſelf ſay's, <hi>Do this in Remembrance of me;</hi> and what St. <hi>Paul</hi> adds, <hi>That as often as we eat of this Bread, and drink of this Cup, we ſhew forth the Lord's Death till he comes;</hi> this I ſay includes the Communication of his Virtue. For Chriſt and his Death, are not Objects of a mere hiſtorical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. It is the ſame with this Divine Saviour as with the Sun; which it is impoſſible to behold without being inlightned by it, and cheared with its Rays. <hi>If we behold him,</hi> ſay's one of the Prophets, <hi>we are inlightned by him.</hi> To declare his Death as we ought, is without doubt an Action inſeparable from the feeling of his Efficacy; and that Man who deny's this Truth, knows lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Chriſt. <hi>3ly.</hi> Neither is it true that <hi>Damaſcen</hi> oppoſes thoſe that deny the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to be the Body of Chriſt in Subſtance, and ſay it is only ſo in Virtue, neither is it true <hi>Beſſarion</hi> imputes to him this Reaſoning, <hi>Were not the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>the proper Subſtance of Chriſt's Body, it would be no more than a mere Figure without Virtue and Efficacy.</hi> This is one of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits which has no Grounds either in the Paſſage of <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> nor in that of <hi>Beſſarion. Beſſarion</hi> indeed would have <hi>Damaſcen</hi> to believe Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the ſubſtantial Preſence; for being a Cardinal in the Roman Church, 'tis no marvel he maintained not the contrary; but he does not ſay <hi>Damaſcen</hi> argued as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſuppoſes. <hi>4ly.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does himſelf furniſh us wherewithal to diſſipate all his Subtilties touching the Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> for we need only apply to the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> what he ſay's concerning <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> in making theſe Fathers argue after this manner; <hi>To ſay the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>is an Image of Chriſt, is the ſame as to ſay 'tis no more than a bare Image without any Efficacy, becauſe the Quality of an Image includes not any Virtue, and the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>cannot have elſewhere this Virtue, there being no place of Scripture which attributes it to it, nor from whence it can be concluded. Now the</hi> Icono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claſtes <hi>affirm the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>to be an Image. They ſay then that 'tis a bare Image without Virtue and Efficacy, and conſequently they contradict themſelves, when they afterwards call it the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; for if it be a mere Image, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Virtually this Body.</hi> This Reaſoning attributed to the Fathers of <hi>Nice,</hi> would be better grounded than that which he Imputes to <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it does not appear <hi>Damaſcen</hi> Diſputes againſt Perſons that Expounded the Words of Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body</hi> in this Sence, <hi>This is the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of my Body;</hi> whereas it appears that the <hi>Iconoclaſtes</hi> had Expounded them in this Sence, <hi>This is the Image of my Body;</hi> whence it follows they might been told better than they have been by <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> that having no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paſſage of Scripture whereby to prove it was the Body of Chriſt in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:41961:189"/> it was no more according to them, than a mere Image without any Efficacy.</p>
                        <p>AS to what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſay's, <hi>That altho</hi> Paſchaſius <hi>his Adverſaries Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded</hi>

                           <hi>theſe Words, The Body of Jeſus Chriſt, the Virtue of Jeſus Chriſt, yet did they not ſay it was the Body it ſelf, that they made not uſe of this Principle, the Figure is not the Original, to ſhew the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>was the Original and not the Figure; That they did not make this ridiculous Argument, The</hi> Euchariſt <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Virtue of Chriſt's Body; It is not then the Figure of it.</hi> I anſwer, we Cited not <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> his Adverſaries for that purpoſe.

But this does not hinder but that by the Term of Body, they underſtood the Virtue of the Body. <hi>Had their Error,</hi> ſay's Mr. <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                           <hi>Arnaud, led them to underſtand by the Word Body, the Figure and Virtue, common Sence would have forced 'em to explain themſelves in proper Terms, to make themſelves underſtood.</hi> But I ſay the <hi>Greeks</hi> do explain themſelves in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Terms. <hi>Ely de Crete</hi> who aſſiſted at the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> does not he <note place="margin">Com. in Greg.

                        <p>IT were better in my Mind to reſerve theſe Proclamations he ſpeaks of, to publiſh to the World there ought no more of thoſe Paſſages of the Fathers to be alledged, ſeeing they are ſo troubleſom to Mr. <hi>Arnaud.</hi> For ſeeing I have incurred his Indignation, for quoting a Paſſage out of <hi>Facundus,</hi> it is fitting the World ſhould henceforward know how to avoid offending him. <hi>This Paſſage,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>of</hi> Facundus <hi>muſt be brought in every where right or wrong.—The Queſtion is whether the Term of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt may</hi>

To contain the Myſtery of Chriſt's Body, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:41961:189"/> the Virtue of it, are two Expreſſions which ſignify at bottom the ſame thing in <hi>Facundus</hi> his Sence, and it is upon good Grounds we have alledged him.

                           <hi>propoſe my Doubts, and muſt be known to be a Perſon extream modeſt, otherwiſe all People will wonder ſo eaſy a matter ſhould ſtartle me, that I conſult not common Sence, touching what I ought to ſay, and that my Head is ſo full of Calviniſtical Subtilities, that I cannot ſpeak after the rate of other Men.</hi> He afterwards <note place="margin">Ibid. c. 7.</note> falls upon a Diſcourſe which takes up ſix great Pages, which amount to this; <hi>That when the Judgment of Reaſon or Faith, is contrary to the Ideas of Sence and Concupiſcence, there is form'd two ſorts of Languages which ſubſiſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the one Conformable to the Ideas of Sence and Concupiſcence, and the other to Faith and Reaſon.</hi> To eſtabliſh this Principle he ſay's, <hi>That Faith changes the Judgment of Sence and Concupiſcence, and ſhews us that what we call Good is a real Evil, that our Evils are reall Goods, that thoſe who are called Happy, are really Miſerable; the Rich, Poor; the Poor, Rich; the Wiſe, Foolls; the Prudent, Imprudent; and the Knowing, Ignorant.</hi> He adds, <hi>That Philoſophy oft overthrows the common Notions of things: That the Thomiſts affirm Matter has no Exiſtence, that a dead Body has nothing in common with a living one, that ſome Philoſophers of this Age teach that Animals are only Machins, and Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, and ſenſible Qualities are not in the things themſelves, but are the Impreſſions of our Sences. That ſeveral of the moſt profound Aſtrologers believe with</hi> Copernicus, <hi>that the Sun and Stars are unmovable, and that 'tis the Earth which by its various Motions makes Day and Night, and Variety of Seaſons.</hi> He tells us afterwards, <hi>That there is in all theſe things a two-fold Language, the one according to Appearance, and the other according to Truth. That 'tis the ſame in reſpect of the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>Faith correcting in it the Ideas of Sence, and from thence comes this twofold Language, the one by which we call the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>Bread, Subſtance of Bread, Matter of Bread, and the other by which we call it the Body of Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>NOT to proceed without profiting by Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Advertiſement, leſt he ſhould accuſe me of Dulneſs: I ſhall venture again humbly to offer the Doubts wherewith common Sence furniſhes me after Conſultation with it, againſt his pretended Solution. <hi>1ſt.</hi> It ſeems to me to contain all the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of a Mind perplext and tormented with Study, how to extricate it ſelf out of a Difficulty, through which it can find no natural Paſſage. What rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has the Ideas of Concupiſcence, the Philoſophy of the Thomiſts, Carteſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Coperniciens, with the Diſcourſe of theſe good Greek Biſhops who lived in the eighth Century, and who without doubt had none of this Philoſophy in their Heads? Who can Imagine that their Expreſſions which are plain and
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:41961:190"/> ſimple, ſhould be grounded on the Model of theſe twofold Languages, that is to ſay, on an Obſervation which ſcarcely ever any Perſon before thought of, ſo remote are theſe twofold Languages from the Sight and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Uſe of the World? In truth, I could never imagine the Ideas of Concupiſcence, the dead Bodies of the Thomiſts, nor the Impreſſions, or Automates of the Cartheſians, and <hi>Copernicus</hi> his Syſtems, ſhould ever be brought into our Diſpute, to decide the Queſtion, whether the <hi>Greeks</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Tranſubſtantiation or not.</p>
                        <p>II. WHAT likelyhood is there that Biſhops aſſembled in Council, whoſe Words were to regulate the Peoples Faith, and whom it behooved moreover to ſpeak diſcreetly, having Adverſaries at their Backs, ſhould lay aſide the Style of Religion, if we believe Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> to take up that of Sence, which Religion condemns? That they ſhould call the <hi>Eucharist</hi> without any Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, <hi>a Matter, and Subſtance of Bread,</hi> conſidering it even after Conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without adding to it either any Expoſition or Mollification, and expoſe themſelves ſo imprudently to the Reproaches of their Enemies, from whom they could expect no Favour nor Support, and who waited for an Occaſion to render them Odious to the People.</p>
                        <p>III. BUT how came it to paſs their Adverſaries, (who, that they might cenſure them touching the Term of Image, dared aſſert contrary to the Truth, that none of the Fathers gave the Term of Image to the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> after Conſecration,) were ſo mild and favourable as to pardon them of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bread,</hi> were their Faith in effect that of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that it is no longer the Subſtance of Bread? Did they do this upon the account of the Thomiſts dead Bodies, the Carteſians Automates, or <hi>Corpernicus</hi> his Syſtem?</p>
                        <p>IV. IF we examine theſe Inſtances of a twofold Language which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> propoſes, we ſhall find they are all Defective, either in reſpect of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or in the Application he makes of them: It is not true Religion abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely teaches that what we call Goods, are real Evils; and that our Evils are real Goods; nor that it turns Felicity into Miſery, Riches into Poverty, Poverty into Riches, Wiſdom into Folly, Prudence into Imprudence, and Knowledg into Ignorance. Religion teaches that theſe things are, in Effect and in themſelves, what we term them, becauſe they are either Bleſſings and God's temporal Favours, or Chaſtiſements and Afflictions which come from his Hand; and ſo far its Language agrees very well with the uſual Speech of Men. But it alſo ſhews us that theſe things change their Name and Nature by the good, or bad Uſe which is made of them; that Riches become real Poverty; Happineſs, Miſery; Wiſdom, Folly; Prudence, Imprudence; and Science, Ignorance; to the Vicious who corrupt theſe Gifts of God, and change their natural Deſtination, that Afflictions likewiſe become Benefits; Poverty, Riches; Miſery, Felicity, to a Virtuous Perſon, and one that fears God. If Concupiſcence would oppoſe it ſelf againſt this Language, and ſpeak otherwiſe, Religion will not let her: So that the double Language that there is in reſpect of theſe things, is grounded not on the Ideas of Concupiſcence, but on Truth it ſelf. When we call Riches, Goods; and Afflictions, Evils; we conſider what they are in their own Nature, and when we call them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, we conſider 'em in relation to what they are by Accident. Theſe two Languages agree very well, and they are both proper and true, the Ideas of Concupiſcence having no part therein. Beſides Religion moreover conſiders
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:41961:190"/> temporal Goods and Evils, either abſolutely in themſelves, or by Compariſon with Spiritual Goods and Evils. In the firſt reſpect it tells us that theſe are Goods and Evils, as they are in effect. In the ſecond ſhe can hardly give them that Name, becauſe they are not conſiderable in compariſon of eternal Goods or Evils. If Concupiſcence oppoſes it ſelf againſt this Language, and ſpeaks otherwiſe, Religion reſtrains Her. It is then certain that the double Language is grounded on various Reſpects, and is ever true: But it is not the ſame with the Point in hand. For ſuppoſing Tranſubſtantiation we cannot in any reſpect call the conſecrated <hi>Euchariſt a Subſtance of Bread,</hi> nor ſay that <hi>we Offer the Subſtance of Bread,</hi> and that <hi>the Subſtance of Bread is the Image of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But Religion will Condemn theſe Expreſſions as Falſe in every Sence, and contrary to that Faith which injoyns us to believe the Subſtance of Bread does no longer remain. To ſay that by the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bread is meant, <hi>the bare Figure and Reſemblance thereof,</hi> as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> does: This cannot be, for the Subſtance, and the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Appearance are two Terms directly oppoſite in the Language of Men; and to ſay <hi>the Subſtance of Bread,</hi> is as much as to ſay Real, and not barely Bread in Appearance. Moreover the Fathers of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> compare this Subſtance of Bread, with the Humane Subſtance which Chriſt aſſumed. <hi>As our Lord,</hi> ſay they, <hi>took on him the Matter only, or Humane Subſtance, without the Perſonal Subſiſtence, ſo he commanded us to Offer an Image, a choſen Matter, that is to ſay the Subſtance of Bread;</hi> which ſhews they took the Term of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> in a proper Sence, and not for a ſimple Appearance. In fine, they ſay that <hi>as the Humane Subſtance which Chriſt aſſumed has not the Perſonal Subſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo this Subſtance has not the Form or Humane Figure,</hi> which clearly ſhews that as by the Humane Subſtance they meant a Subject capable of having perſonal Subſiſtence, ſo they likewiſe underſtood by the Subſtance uſed in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> a real Subject which may have a Form or humane Figure, and conſequently a real Subſtance, capable of Repreſenting an external Form and Figure.</p>
                        <p>TO ſay likewiſe as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does, that this is the Language of Sence, which is contrary to the Judgment of Faith, is as much as if he had ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. For if Faith rectified the Language of Sence, it would not ſuffer its Expreſſions to be Regulated by the Falſity of their Teſtimony, and much leſs in a Decree of Council, whoſe Expreſſions according to Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Maxims, or the Church he is of, muſt ſerve for a Law to Poſterity not only for well Speaking, but likewiſe for well Believing. We ought then keep to the Language of Faith, not that of Sence, againſt which we muſt on the contrary Precaution our ſelves to prevent being ſurpriz'd by it. When the Chriſtian Religion came into the World, and reform'd the Abuſes of Men, who believed their Idols were Gods; She at the ſame time Corrected their Expreſſions. She no longer ſuffered Men to ſpeak of <hi>Gods</hi> in the Plural, nor of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> and theſe other falſe Divinities as formerly; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Pulpit, and Sermons, or in the Decrees of Councils.</p>
                        <p>AS to the Example of Philoſophers, we muſt not wonder if they accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate their Expreſſions to the Language of other Men, altho it be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their Hypotheſes. For they are not the Maſters of it, the neceſſity of making themſelves underſtood, and the fear of paſſing for Extravagants ſhould they affect a new Style, obliges them to expreſs themſelves as the World does, ſeeing they cannot make it unlearn their Language, and accuſtom it ſelf to ſpeak according to their Opinions. This ſhews their
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:41961:191"/> Opinions did not reign when humane Language eſtabliſhed it ſelf, and that moreover at this Day they are not Popular; but this does not ſhew 'twas the ſame in the Chriſtian Religion, in reſpect of the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> The Language of the Church touching this Myſtery was not found ready made, it was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Sentiments Men began to have of it, as ſoon as ever 'twas Mention'd. Suppoſing then that from the firſt riſe of Chriſtianity it were believed the Teſtimony of our Senſes was Falſe and Deceitful, and that the Subſtance of Bread was really changed into that of the Body of Chriſt; Men would have avoided ſpeaking according to Senſe, and Religion which was the Maſter of it, would never have ſuffer'd it. And ſo much the rather, (if the Suppoſition be made which I mentioned,) it muſt be neceſſarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that this Myſtery is popular, there being none of the People but ought to know that the Subſtance which he receives, is not that of Bread, but of the Body of Chriſt. Beſides this, there is a great deal of Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Religion and Philoſophy; Philoſophical Opinions do not ſo greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the World in general, nor in particular thoſe that hold them, that Men ought to be ſo much troubled about common Expreſſions, how contrary ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may be to theſe Opinions, and lyable to Error. No Man will be damned for believing a dead Body is the material Part of Man which remains, that Animals are not Automates, but real living Bodies, nor that Colours really in the Objects, nor for believing the Sun and Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment move, and not the Earth. Theſe Cartheſians and Coperniciens have not yet aſſerted their Sentiments to be neceſſary to Salvation, nor obligatory on the Conſcience. So that if the contrary Sentiments be erroneous, they are not believed to be ſo dangerous as that humane Speech muſt be therefore altered. But if Chriſtian Religion has propoſed Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, or the Subſtantial Preſence, it is to be ſuppoſed ſhe has offered it as an Article of Faith neceſſary to be Believed in order to Salvation, as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle which obliges the Conſcience, and rejected the contrary Opinion as a damnable Error, inconſiſtent with Salvation, and conſequently ſhe ought to warn Men touching the Expreſſions, and not leave to our Sences; that is to ſay, to Cheats and Impoſtors, the Power of making a Council ſay in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of Faith, that we offer in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> a Subſtance of Bread.</p>
                        <p>TO ſay in fine, this Council only <hi>denoted the Matter of the</hi> Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does, is an Unjuſtifiable Evaſion. For when we deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">P. 693.</note> the Matter of it, by the Term of <hi>Subſtance of Bread,</hi> we conſider it before its Conſecration, ſuppoſing 'tis believed that by the Conſecration 'tis no more the Subſtance of Bread, but that of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. Yet theſe Fathers conſidered it after the Conſecration, as appears by their whole Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Thoſe of <hi>Nice</hi> have thus obſerved it, for they cenſure them for call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> an Image after Conſecration. Now in the ſame place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thoſe of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> call it Image, they call it likewiſe a Subſtance of Bread. If the Cenſure of thoſe of <hi>Nice</hi> be juſt, the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> muſt be, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> an <hi>Image</hi> after Conſecration. What likelyhood is there Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſhould at this time underſtand better the Sence of this Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> than the Fathers of <hi>Nice</hi> who had amongſt them ſeveral Biſhops that Aſſiſted at that Aſſembly, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others him who preſided over it? But I will grant the Nicene Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were miſtaken, and that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> underſtands the Point better than they; yet it is certain they ought to have Cenſured the Expreſſion of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bread,</hi> ſeeing they could not take it but as ſpoken of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> after its Conſecration. Theſe of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> call the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> in the ſame
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:41961:191"/> Place and Period, <hi>Image and Subſtance of Bread.</hi> They take the Name of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, as a Quality attributed to the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> after Conſecration. They muſt then neceſſarily have taken the Subſtance of Bread, as an Attribute applyed likewiſe to the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> after the Conſecration: Yet thoſe of <hi>Nice</hi> Cenſure the firſt, and do not in any manner Cenſure the other; they are Offended at the one, and not at the other; which concludes as I already ſaid, that their <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> was not Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
                        <p>THE Biſhops of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> comparing the <hi>Eucharist</hi> with Chriſt's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <note place="margin">C. 7. p. 6, 6.</note> Body, ſay that <hi>as the natural Body is Holy, being made Divine; ſo that which is his Body by Inſtitution, to wit, his Image is Holy</hi>

There, ſay they, the natural Fleſh was Anointed with the Holy Spirit: Here his Image, to wit, the Bread is filled with the Holy Spirit. The Queſtion then is concerning a Sanctification which the Bread receives in quality of the Image of our Lord's natural Fleſh, and this Sanctification is the Grace of the Holy Spirit where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Bread is filled.

                        <p>I am ſorry I have been forced to entertain the Reader with theſe gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Niceties, which I ſuppoſe cannot be very pleaſing; but beſides that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> having charged me with a Falſification, I was obliged to juſtify my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: There will redound hence this Advantage, to wit, that the Sence of this Council will more plainly appear, and the ſolid Advantages we draw thence. They make two Bodies of Chriſt, the one his natural Body, th'other his Body by Inſtitution; the one is his natural Fleſh, th'other is the Image of his natural Fleſh; the one a humane Subſtance, th'other a choſen Matter, namely the Subſtance of Bread; the one is Holy by a Sanctification which is naturally pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar unto it, the other is raiſed from a common State to a State of Holyneſs; the one is the natural Fleſh of Chriſt anointed by the Holy Spirit, the other is Bread indued with the Holy Spirit. There is not any thing in all this that can agree with Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Conceptions.</p>
                        <p>NO more then is there in the Fathers calling the <hi>Euchariſt, not a deceitful Image of Chriſt's Fleſh,</hi> in oppoſition to the Images which they called Deceitful. <note place="margin">C. 7. p. 698.</note> To underſtand rightly their Sence, we muſt ſuppoſe with Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> that they ſaid the Images of their Adverſaries were deceitful, either becauſe they repreſented the Humanity ſeparated from the Divinity, and ſubſiſting by it ſelf, (if it were ſaid they were only Images of the Humanity, they leaned to the Error of the <hi>Neſtorians)</hi> or becauſe they repreſented the Divinity Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and indiſtinct from the Humanity, if it were ſaid they expreſſed our Saviour intire, thus they led to the Error of the <hi>Eutychiens</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded the two Natures. So far Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is not miſtaken; but he has not been ſo happy in Diſcovering how they underſtood the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> was not a deceitful Image. For it is certain that in reſpect of the Error of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> their Sence is, that as the humane Subſtance in our Saviour had no perſonal Subſiſtance, ſo likewiſe his Image, to wit, the Subſtance of Bread, has not the Form and humane Figure of it, altho it ſeems that an Image ſhould have them: So that by this it repreſented the humane Nature not as a Perſon, but as a Nature bereav'd of its Perſonality, and thus it differed from the Error of the Neſtorians: Which is what they Expreſs in theſe Terms; <hi>As our Lord took on him the Matter only or humane Subſtance, without the perſonal Subſiſtance, ſo he has commanded us to offer an Image, a choſen Matter, that is to ſay the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bread, not having the Form or humane Figure.</hi> And in reſpect of the Error of the Eutychiens they would have, that as the Body of Chriſt was not Aboliſhed, nor Confounded with the Divinity, but Sanctified and made
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:41961:192"/> Divine by means of the hypoſtatical Union; ſo the Bread is Sanctified and Deified by the Holy Spirit: Which is what they expreſſed by theſe Terms, <hi>As by Virtue of the Union our Saviour deified the Fleſh he took by a Sanctification, which is naturally proper to him; ſo likewiſe he would have the Bread in the</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, <hi>as being not the deceitful Image of his natural Fleſh, to be made a Divine Body by the coming of the Holy Spirit, the Oblation being by means of the Prieſt transferred from a common State, to a State of Holyneſs.</hi> Now this does neceſſarily ſuppoſe that the Subſtance of Bread Subſiſts, to repreſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Eutychus</hi> the Subſtance of the humane Nature in the hypoſtatical Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Moreover this is not one of my metaphyſical Speculations, as Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">P. 669.</note> is pleaſed to expreſs himſelf; it is the Doctrine of the Fathers, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of thoſe who diſputed againſt <hi>Eutychus,</hi> and I expreſly obſerved it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for this effect cited <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Theodoret, Gelaſius,</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> of <hi>Antioch.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has thought good in relating my Words to cut off this Clauſe, for fear the Readers ſhould ſee that the Sence I attributed to the Fathers of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and which he is pleaſed to call a metaphyſical Speculation of Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> is in effect, a Doctrine commonly received in the Greek Church.</p>
                        <p>I drew Advantage from the Council's ſaying that <hi>our Saviour choſe a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which does not repreſent any humane Shape, leſt Idolatry ſhould be thereby Introduced:</hi> And pretended that in whatſoever ſort theſe Words were Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, they were Inconſiſtent with the Belief of the real Preſence. Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> Anſwers that this Paſſage <hi>is capable of three Sences. The Firſt, That</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 7. c. 7. p. 700. 701.</note> 
                           <hi>God would not let the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>have a humane Shape, leſt it ſhould be adored. The 2d. That he would not ſuffer the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>to have a humane Form, leſt Men ſhould commit Idolatry in Adoring it under this humane Figure, altho it be no Idolatry to Worſhip it under the Figure of Bread. The 3d. That he would not let the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>have a humane Form, leſt the due Worſhip which would be given it under this humane Figure, ſhould carry Men forth to Adore I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of Wood and Stone, which being not our Saviour as the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>is, could not be Worſhiped without Idolatry. The firſt,</hi> adds he, <hi>of theſe Sences is that which the Calviniſts give to the Words of the</hi> Iconoclaſtes. <hi>The 2. Is a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Sence, and that which never any Perſon yet Imagined. The 3d. Is the Sence which the Catholicks give them. Hereupon Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>to eſtabliſh his firſt Sence, Declames at large againſt the 2d. which is not a Sence, but an abſurd I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination which he has form'd.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>HAD Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſincerely related all that I ſaid on this Subject, and not maim'd my Diſcourſe, and produced but ſome part thereof disjoynted from the reſt, that he might turn it into a wrong Sence: It would have been eaſily perceived that I offered theſe two laſt Sences, and ſhewed that both of 'em were Inconſiſtent, with the Suppoſition of the ſubſtantial Preſence. That I afterwards eſtabliſhed the true Sence of theſe Words, in ſuppoſing the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt</hi> to be an Image really diſtinct from our Lord's Body. I neither attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> nor to any body elſe any Sence. I only propoſed the two which might be given to theſe Words upon ſuppoſal of the real Preſence, and ſhewed that neither of them were juſtifiable. I am not at all troubled at Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s calling the Second an <hi>abſurd Imagination;</hi> I hold it to be ſo as well as he, and as ſuch I have refuted it. But the Laſt is no leſs abſurd than the Second: For the due Worſhip which would be given to the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> if it had a humane Shape, would not induce Men to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Images of Wood and Stone. The Difference would be appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:41961:193"/> for the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> would be the Body of Chriſt, the Image of Wood not ſo: The Adoration of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> would not be then grounded on the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Shape or Figure, but on the ſubſtantial Preſence of Chriſt's Body. Moreover what can be more Ridiculous than the Opinion which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> Imputes to theſe People, which is, that our Saviour would have propoſed his Body really in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> clothed with another humane Figure than his own natural Form: <hi>Otherwiſe,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>it would not be an Image, but our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himſelf without any Vail.</hi> It is true, but this ſhould make him compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that they underſtood the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> was not the proper Subſtance of this Body, but an Image which is of another Subſtance than its Original. For a Man cannot be guilty of a greater Abſurdity than to imagine our Saviour's Body is really in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> in a humane Shape, not his own; but a borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one. Theſe kind of Imaginations reſide not in the Minds of reaſonable People. But ſuppoſing this was their Sence, how could they ſay that our Saviour would not take upon him any other humane Shape than his own to prevent Idolatry? Might not their Adverſaries tell them on the contrary that this very Conſideration ought to prevail on us the more to make Images? For the Original of our Saviour's Body, in whatſoever State it is, takes Men off from Images, but it would carry them further off from them if it had a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Figure, whatſoever it were, for this is what our Eyes ſeek in Images, and if they found this Figure joyned with the Original, they need not ſearch it elſewhere. I confeſs that the Original Speaking, Moving it ſelf, and Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under its own proper Figure, would better produce this Effect; but this does not hinder but that it may produce it likewiſe, having a ſimple borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Figure, without Speech and Action, ſeeing that alſo Images have neither Speech nor Action, and that the Figure they have is no leſs a borrowed Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, than that which the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> would have. It is certain that this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Devotion which ſeeks after Repreſentations, and viſible Lineaments, would be more ſatisfied in beholding a humane Shape whatſoever it were, applyed on the Original it ſelf, than to behold one repreſented on Cloth, or the Walls of a Houſe. It muſt then be acknowledged that the true Sence of this Council ſuppoſes the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to be an Image really diſtinct from the Body of Chriſt, and that our Saviour has choſen for this a Matter, or a Subſtance which has not a humane Figure, leſt this Reſemblance ſhould carry Men forth to render to the Image that which is only due to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and to make others like it, of other matters, to Adore them. Whoſoever ſhall compare my Expoſition with that of Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> will ſoon acknowledg that mine is Natural, Free, and according to good Sence, whereas his is For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and Violent, and imputes to Perſons ſuch a kind of Arguing as is abſurd and groundleſs.</p>

                           <hi>BUT,</hi> ſay's Mr. <hi>Arnaud, the</hi> Iconoclaſtes <hi>Adored the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>with a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">C. 7. p. 702.</note> 
                           <hi>Adoration: For</hi> Stephen <hi>the Younger ſaid to</hi> Conſtantin Copronymus, <hi>Do not you deſign likewiſe to caſt out of the Church the Antitypes of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, ſeeing they contain the true Image of them, and we Adore and Kiſs them, and are Sanctified by receiving them?</hi> Stephen <hi>proves the Worſhip of Images by a Principle common to the</hi> Iconoclaſtes. <hi>Now according to them, all Worſhip rendred to Images is a real Adoration, and is due to God only, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently they gave to the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>a Worſhip which they ſuppoſed due only to God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT could not Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> foreſee, that we may argue exactly contrary, and ſay <hi>Stephen</hi> proves the relative Adoration of Images by that of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt.</hi>
                           <pb n="355" facs="tcp:41961:193"/> Neither of them then gave the <hi>Eucharist</hi> any other than a relative Adoration, and conſequently they neither of them believed, that it was the Body of Chriſt in proper Subſtance. <hi>But,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>the</hi> Iconoclaſtes <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged but one only Adoration, which is, that which is due to God alone, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                           <hi>they gave the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>a Worſhip which they ſuppoſed due only to God.</hi> There cannot be a weaker Argument; <hi>Stephen</hi> does not only prove the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Adoration of Images, by the Example of that which is given the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,</hi> but likewiſe by the Example of that which is given to the Croſs, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Veſtments and Veſſels. If Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Conſequence be good, we muſt ſay likewiſe that the <hi>Iconoclaſtes</hi> rendred to all theſe things a Worſhip which they acknowledged to be only due to God alone, which is not eaſy to believe. It muſt then be neceſſarily acknowledged either that the <hi>Iconoclaſtes</hi> rejected not abſolutely the diſtinction of the two Adorations; the one Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, and the other Relative, or that they acknowledged not the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour given to the Croſs, Sacred Veſtments, and the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> was a real Adoration, and there is a greater likelyhood in the laſt, than in the other. So that <hi>Stephen</hi> proves well the relative Adoration of Images, by the relative Adoration of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and other ſacred things; but this is not by a Principle common to the <hi>Iconoclaſtes</hi> and their Adverſaries, but only by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Ceremonies which were common to them both, and which were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly expounded by both Parties.</p>

Whence it follows that altho the Writing which was read in the Council condemned the Uſe of this Term, yet <hi>Stephen</hi> (who was engaged in the ſame Affair as the Author of this Writing) made uſe of it; which ſhews that this Doctrine, that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is not an Image or Figure, was

                        <p>BUT to return to the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> it is granted 'twas <hi>Taraſus</hi> who (before he accepted of the See of <hi>Conſtantinople,)</hi> obtained a Promiſe from the Empreſs <hi>Iréne</hi> that there ſhould be a Council called; but this does not hinder but it may be ſaid, <hi>That he was not ſetled in this See till he had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from</hi> Iréne <hi>the Convocation of this Synod.</hi> But whether it was at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt or not, that <hi>Iréne</hi> did it, it little matters; for it is ſtill certain they were agreed in it; and this Condition on which he is ſaid to accept of that See, ſhews only that he was far engaged to maintain the Cauſe of Images, and already became a Party. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> cannot deny that <hi>Taraſus</hi> had already declared himſelf in the Letter he wrote to Pope <hi>Adrian.</hi> Neither can he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more deny the Pope anſwered him he would not conſent to his Election to the Patriarchate, unleſs he Re-eſtabliſhed the Worſhip of Images. All this is expreſly contained in <hi>Adrian</hi>'s Letters, and thence may juſtly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that this Perſon was not at his own Liberty when he preſided in this Council, and could at fartheſt be conſidered only as the Head of a Party, which was at that time the ſtrongeſt, as being upheld by the Empreſs <hi>Iréne,</hi> and her chief Miniſter <hi>Stauracius.</hi> Now this by good right makes void whatſoever <hi>Taraſus</hi> did afterwards.</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> cannot deny but that the two Monks <hi>Thomas,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> whom the Council ever called <hi>The Vicars, or Repreſentatives of the Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Sees in the Eaſt,</hi> were ſent by ſome Hermit of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and not by the Patriarchs of <hi>Antioch, Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> nor by the Conſent of the Patriarchal, or other Churches. Whence it appears this Council could not rightly call it ſelf Univerſal, nor be preferred above that of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> altho ſo eſteemed by the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> who tells us as a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Matter, that all the Patriarchs were there preſent.</p>
                        <p>

                           <hi>give them the Place of the Patriarchs.</hi> If it were a mere Favour of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, then the Preſence of theſe Men ought not to be made a Ground for the calling this an oecumenical Council; and by this means to give it the greater Authority. The Author then of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> had no reaſon ſo loudly to
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:41961:194"/> proclame, that all the Patriarchs were preſent at it. For it is Abſurd to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Patriarchs aſſiſted at it, under Pretence there was given <hi>by mere Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> the Place of Patriarchs to two Religious, who had neither Order nor Miſſion from theſe Patriarchs. <hi>Yet this Favour,</hi> adds Mr. <hi>Arnaud, was</hi>

Whether this was for Fear, or out of reſpect of the Trouble which might thereby happen to the Church, I did not affirm; and therefore Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> had no reaſon to charge me with Falſity.</p>

                           <hi>Religious, ſeeing on the contrary theſe Religious who were gathered together per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded them to return:</hi> This is ſtill wrangling about a Trifle. When we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed this Relation, we were not ſo curious to inquire whether their Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to return preceded the Aſſembly, or whether it was the Aſſembly that adviſed them to it. The Letters Inform us, that they immediately met with two of their old Friends, to whom they diſcovered themſelves, that thoſe Friends joyfully Received them; <hi>But Concealed 'em for fear of the Enemies of the Croſs, that being diſcreet they would not make known their Arrival, nor Counſel them to perform the Voyage they had undertaken.</hi> So that here I think is the Deſign of their Return half Reſolved upon, thro the Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of theſe two Friends.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>IT is falſe,</hi> ſay's Mr. <hi>Arnaud, that they aſſembled theſe Religious after</hi>

                           <hi>it was from theſe Religious that they underſtood it.</hi> The Care their Friends took in immediately concealing them for fear of the Enemies of the Croſs, not daring to truſt any Body with the News of their Arrival, nor to aſſiſt them in their Voyage, ſufficiently convinced them of their Danger in going farther. Now this is ſet down in the Religiouſe's Letters as a matter which preceded their Aſſembly.</p>
                        <p>

                           <hi>ſix in number. This is a ſilly Fancy of Mr.</hi> Claude: <hi>For there was a great number of Religious then in</hi> Paleſtine, <hi>and therefore I ſee no reaſon why there ſhould be no more than five or ſix aſſembled upon an Affair of ſo great Importance.</hi> But this is not ſo ſilly neither: For ſeeing the two Friends we now mentioned, were forced to hide the Deputies for fear of the Infidels, 'tis very likely they called no great Aſſembly for this Affair, how important ſoever it was. The Letter of the Religious informs us that theſe two Friends having ſecured the Deputies, haſtned to the Religious, <hi>whom they ſecretly aſſembled, and Swore them firſt to keep ſecret the Affair they had to communicate to them.</hi> This I think ſufficiently ſhews that the Aſſembly was but ſmall, and could not exceed the number of five or ſix; for a numerous Aſſembly would not well agree with this great Fear and Secret.</p>

Neither can Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſay theſe Monks ſpake thus only in mere Modeſty, and that their Words are not to be taken in a ſtrict Sence. For beſides that the Modeſty of learned Men does never proceed to this Exceſs, as to call themſelves Ignorant and Unskilful Perſons: 'tis to be conſidered the other Religious did not gainſay but that they were really ſuch as they termed themſelves: They Anſwer that God will manifeſt his Power by their Weakneſs. Is it then Raſhneſs and Injuſtice in me to ſpeak according to the Expreſſions of this Letter?

                           <hi>Allatius,</hi> excuſe the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> He ought not to aſſert any thing in a matter of this Importance, without a careful Examination of it, for 'tis not the Examples of others that will excuſe ſuch kind of Faults as theſe. Moreover there is a conſiderable Difference between the Tranſlation of <hi>Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landus, Combefis,</hi> and <hi>Allatius,</hi> and that of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> They Tranſlate, <hi>Trinaque genuflexione adorans:</hi> This <hi>adorans</hi> is an Addition to the Letter, and an Explication of what may be pretended the <hi>genuflexion</hi> ſignifies, but 'tis not a ſpoyling of the Sence, for 'tis certain that in this Occaſion the <hi>genuflexion</hi> is an Adoration. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> needed not Expatiate in long Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes and Diſtinctions to prove it; We grant it. All that can be ſaid in this Reſpect is, that <hi>Bollandus, Combefis,</hi> and <hi>Allatius,</hi> have rather performed the Office of Paraphraſtiſts, than that of Tranſlators. The Paraphraſtiſts do not only Explain the Terms, but the Matters Repreſented by them: They inlarge upon Matters, and when two Notions are joyned together by any Dependance, they paſs eaſily from one to the other; this is allowable in them. But Tranſlators muſt be more exact, they muſt faithfully render the Expreſſions as much as the Idiom of the Language they Tranſlate in will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them. They ought eſpecially to keep to the firſt Sence and Notion which the Letter gives them, and never take the Liberty to paſs over from one Sence to another, or from one Idea to another, whatſoever Coherence and Dependence there may ſeem to be betwixt them: For this is not permitted them. A Paraphraſtiſt may for Inſtance very well ſay on our Saviour's Words to <hi>Judas: Doſt thou betray the Son of Man with a Kiſs, in doing him Homage, and ſhewing him Reſpect and Friendſhip.</hi> This does explain that which the Kiſs given to our Saviour does naturally Signify, and a Man paſſes thus from one Idea to another. But ſhould a Tranſlator pretend to this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, it would be juſtly denyed him. A Paraphraſtiſt may make our Lord ſay, <hi>I am the Spiritual and Myſtical Light of the World inlightning others.</hi> A Tranſlator cannot; for altho this be the true Sence of the Word <hi>Light,</hi> yet 'tis a ſecond and explicatory Sence, which is not exactly the firſt Notion which the Letter gives. We muſt ſay the ſame that when <hi>Bollandus, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>befis,</hi> and <hi>Allatius</hi> have Tranſlated, <hi>Trinaque genuum flexione adorans:</hi> They were Paraphraſtiſts, not Tranſlators, and kept not the Character they took upon them: They cannot be excuſed by ſaying as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does, that <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuflexion</hi> in a Matter of Religion is an Act of Adoration. For altho this be true, this is not the firſt Idea which the Letter of the Greek Text gives. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="360" facs="tcp:41961:196"/> has done no more than the Evangeliſts did: For as to St.</hi> Luke's <hi>ſaying, That the leprous Perſon fell flat on his Face before our Saviour Chriſt: And St.</hi>

Had the Tranſlation of <hi>Mons</hi> rendred theſe Words of St. <hi>Luke, kneeled down, or worſhiped him,</hi> inſtead of <hi>falling on the Ground,</hi> it might be juſtly blamed; and that Man ill underſtands the Rules of Tranſlation, who allows in himſelf or others this Liberty.</p>
                        <p>SO far concerning <hi>Bollandus, Combefis,</hi> and <hi>Allatius:</hi> But the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> did not think good to ſtop here: Beſides the Addition of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion which is not in the Greek Text, he has proceeded to the altering the Sence in determining it. For he Tranſlates, <hi>And WORSHIPING it in bending thrice the Knee, and with folded Hands, you ſhall receive into your Mouth the Sacred Body of Jeſus Chriſt our God.</hi> He has written this Word <hi>Worſhiping</hi> in great Characters, to ſhew that thereon depends the Deciſion of the Queſtion, as referring it ſelf to the Body of Chriſt which we receive into our Mouths; that is to ſay, to the Sacrament it ſelf. Th'others left it at the Readers Liberty to refer this Adoration to God, or our Saviour in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: But the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> judged not this ſufficient, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would have it only relate to the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> Now this is an inexcuſable Depravation: For what Right has this Author to add an Expreſſion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine moreover the Sence of it, by an Article which hinders us from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding it any otherwiſe than he pleaſes. Is it fairly done of a Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor who cites a Paſſage in a Diſpute to deal thus. <hi>It is apparent,</hi> ſay's Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud, that in this Paſſage theſe Genuflexions refer themſelves to our Saviour</hi>

                           <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Which I deny, if by the Body of Chriſt he means the Sacrament; provided Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> can ſay, <hi>it is Apparent, it is Clear, or it is Falſe,</hi> the Matter is decided, he has done enough. But why is this apparent? Is not there more likelyhood on the contrary that theſe three Genuflexions reſpect the three Perſons of the Trinity, to whom is ſung the <hi>Triſagion? This An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is,</hi> again ſay's he, <hi>Ridiculous;</hi> why Ridiculous? <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>that ſinging of Pſalms, or of the</hi> Triſagion, <hi>rehearſing the Creed, and folding the Hands, are ſeveral Parts of the whole Ceremony injoyned by the Biſhop, all of which reſpect the Bleſſed Sacrament, and ſerve as a Preparation for its Reception, and not to one another.</hi> It is true they all reſpect the Celebration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Action, and ſerve for a Preparation to the Communion; but that they all refer themſelves to the Sacrament, that is to ſay, to the Object which is preſent before our Eyes, as ſo many marks of Reverence given to it; this cannot be truly ſaid, for the <hi>Triſagion</hi> is adreſſed to the Holy Trinity, and not to the Sacrament. What alſo hinders but that the three Genuflexions may be made in Honour of the three Perſons? Thoſe that know the Temper of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> need not be told what great Lovers of Myſteries they are in all things, as <hi>Combeſis</hi> does ſomewhere obſerve; <hi>Graeci,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>ſunt valde myſtici;</hi> it is then very likely that the number of three in their Kneelings has a myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Reaſon and refers it ſelf to three Perſons.

The Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> ſhall bring in his Prejudication into his Tranſlations, and add unto them what he pleaſes; and having thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated them to his Sence, he may give 'em me for good and ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Proofs, and I muſt not have the Liberty to charge his Tranſlations with Falſity, till I have ſhowed his Prejudications to be Falſe. Is there the leaſt Dram of Equity in this? After this rate Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> may Tranſlate thus the Words of Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body in proper Subſtance;</hi> For this Tranſlation is agreeable to his Prejudication, he may alledg them to me in this Form as a good and excellent Proof; and if I tell him his Tranſlation is Falſe, and that 'tis not thus in the Original, he may maintain againſt me that I have not the Liberty to charge his Tranſlation as Falſe, till ſuch time as I have proved that the Term of Body, does not ſignify the Body in proper Subſtance: And the Laws of Controverſie being as well for the Benefit of the one Party, as the other; I will render the ſame Words, <hi>This Bread is the ſign of my Body;</hi> and producing my Tranſlation as an expreſs Proof of my Sentiment, I will likewiſe tell him that he muſt not Accuſe my Tranſlation as Falſe, till he has proved that by the Term of Body, when the Queſtion concerns the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we muſt not underſtand the Sign of Chriſt's Body.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>BUT,</hi> adds he, <hi>as this is an unjuſtifyable Pretenſion</hi> (to wit, the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that the Term of Body does not ſignify the true Body) <hi>and is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly confuted by all the</hi> Greeks <hi>of our time, in ſuppoſing the Words of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt ſignify the real Body of Chriſt, we have had reaſon to ſuppoſe that thoſe of bending the Knee, ſignify a real Adoration:</hi> What weak Arguing is here? Suppoſe theſe three Genuflexions refer themſelves to the Body of Chriſt which we receive into our Mouths; Suppoſe that by the Term of Body, we muſt underſtand the Body in proper Subſtance; Then Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Tranſlation will be tolerable. There is ſo great Irregularity in all this, that the plain Repetition of it is enough to Confute it.</p>
                        <p>AND thus have we conſidered whatſoever Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has propoſed of any Weight in his ſeventh Book, and in his ſecond, third, and fourth, touching the <hi>Greeks,</hi> to perſwade the World that Tranſubſtantiation is one of their Doctrines. We have met with ſeveral Deluſions, and many Paralogiſms, which are the two Characters of a Perſon that is deceived himſelf, and would have others to be deceived with him. He has not been ſparing of his fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Hiſtories, falſe Suppoſitions, ſtarcht Prefaces, Amplifications, Exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in a Word, of any of the Artifices of Rhetorick; and that which is moſt ſtrange, is, he has never leſs ſhunned the ſlipping into theſe Defaults, then when he has himſelf moſt unjuſtly accuſed me of them. I take no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his Invectives, and Sharpneſs with which he has ſtuffed his Diſcourſes to render 'em more taking and agreeable, nor of that common Cuſtom of his, of taking in a contrary Sence the moſt ſolid Matters, to make them ſeem Ridiculous. All which has not hindred but that I have done the three things I took upon me to prove; The firſt to ſhew that altho it were true the <hi>Greeks</hi> believed Tranſubſtantiation, it would not thence follow that this Doctrine has been perpetually in the Church. The other, That the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not in effect hold Tranſubſtantiation, nor Adore the <hi>Euchariſt:</hi> And the Third, That all Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Efforts to prove the contrary Propoſition are Ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:41961:197"/> and that the greateſt part of his Proofs conclude directly againſt himſelf: The Firſt of theſe has been eſtabliſhed by ſolid Reflections on evident mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact; The Second by good Proofs; And the Third by pertinent An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, and moſt natural Conſequences.</p>
                        <p>IT only remains now to be concluded from this whole Diſpute, that Tranſubſtantiation and the ſubſtantial Preſence are in effect an Innovation of the <hi>Latins,</hi> and not the ancient Doctrines of Chriſtianity, ſeeing they are not found eſtabliſhed in the Greek Church. This Concluſion is as every Man may ſee directly oppoſite to that of Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> but if compared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it will be ſoon found that mine is drawn from my Principle with far greater Evidence, and Neceſſity, than the other follows from his. For, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the <hi>Greeks</hi> do believe the Converſion of Subſtances, it cannot hence follow that this Doctrine has been perpetually held by that Church, as we made appear in our ſecond Book. But if they do not believe it, it is a plain ſign that it was neither Believed nor ſo much as heard of by the two Churches before their Separation. If the <hi>Greeks</hi> do now at this day believe this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, having not done ſo heretofore, we cannot marvel thereat, conſidering their Condition (as it has been repreſented by us) ſince the eleventh Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, and the unwearied Pains the <hi>Latins</hi> have taken for the Propogation of the Doctrines of the Roman Church in the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> to which end they have uſed, and do ſtill uſe all kind of Means. But ſuppoſing they believed it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, it is hard to conceive they have ceaſed believing it, becauſe it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally more Difficult for Men to give over believing what they did once Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, than to begin to believe what they did not Believe, and becauſe likewiſe the leaſt Effect this aforementioned Commerce of the <hi>Latins</hi> with the <hi>Greeks</hi> could Produce, would be to Cheriſh and Preſerve a Doctrine of this Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance amongſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> themſelves, and to hinder its being Loſt.</p>

                           <note place="margin">lib. 5. C. 1. p. 423.</note> 
                           <hi>large, as well for that the Fallacious arguings which Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>makes thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, deſerve to be repreſented; as that alſo, the Opinion of the</hi> Moſcovites <hi>appeared to him very Conſiderable in this matter.</hi> To ſpeak plainly, theſe are meer frivolous Pretences, as it will appear in the ſequel, and unleſs he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined this Multiplication of Objects would contribute ſomething to his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and make it more Illuſtrious; there can be no reaſon alledged for the mentioning of the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> apart, for if it be true theſe People profeſs to follow the Greek Religion, (as he ſay's;) aſſoon as ever we are ſatisfied of the Doctrine of theſe laſt, we need not trouble our ſelves any longer, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Belief of the others.

                        <p>TO begin with the ſtate of theſe People, <hi>Moſcovia</hi> is a great Nation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the Chriſtian Religion, but otherwiſe extream Barbarous and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Doctrines of Chriſtianity.

                           <hi>Baptiſm, and the outward Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion.</hi> They refer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon all Accounts to their Prince as to their Oracle, ſaying when they be asked touching any Point, <hi>That God and their Great Czar know it, and that 'tis by the eſpecial Grace of their Czar, they are in Health, and can ſit on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back.</hi> One of their Chief Maxims is to ſuffer no Preachers amongſt them, and in Effect they have none, but content themſelves with the reading of the Pſalms, ſome Chapters of the Scripture, and S. <hi>Athanaſius</hi>'s Creed; to which they ſometimes add an Homely of S. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> or the Life of ſome of their Saints. Mr. <hi>Olearius</hi> adds, <hi>That one of their Prieſts ſetting himſelf to Preach, and exhort the People out of the word of God to the duty of Prayer, the Patriarch depoſed him together with ſome other Prieſts who followed his Example; that he excommunicated them and ſent them into</hi> Siberia,</p>
                        <p>THERE are neither Accademy's nor Colledges amongſt them, and it would be a Crime puniſhable by the Laws of that Kingdom, for a man to <note place="margin">Poſſev. ubi ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra.</note> apply himſelf to the ſtudy of Sciences. They have only ſome ſmall Schools wherein they teach Children to Write and Read, and perhaps a little Greek and Latine in one Corner of the Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>HENCE it is their Eccleſiaſticks are ſo Prodigiouſly ignorant that <note place="margin">Olear.

                        <p>THEIR Superſtition is no leſs than their Ignorance, witneſs their calling <note place="margin">Olear.

                        <p>I could willingly forbear mentioning things of this Nature, did not I find that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> in his Diſcourſes concerning theſe People, ſeems to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent us with an Idea of the moſt happy and flouriſhing People in the World.</p>
                        <p>

                           <note place="margin">Lib. 5. C. 1. p. 423.</note> 
                           <hi>This is a Nation which has ever had but little Commerce with the reſt of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the World, few Perſons Voyaging into thoſe parts, and few</hi> Moſcovites <hi>into</hi> Aſia <hi>and</hi> Europe. <hi>There was never in this Country a mixture of Perſons of divers Communions. It cannot be ſay'd the</hi> Latins <hi>have brought over their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions here by</hi> Croiſados; <hi>and 'tis obſerved by all Authors that theſe People are exceeding careful to preſerve their ancient Cuſtoms, and Doctrines. In fine, there is no Country in the World more tenacious of their Opinions, and which leſs eaſily admits a new one. The Church of this Kingdom is a Church purely Greek, and owes it's Converſion to the Greek Church, having received from her the Doctrine ſhe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes. There are ſcarcely any other Books read amongſt them, than ſome Greek Fathers tranſlated into the</hi> Sclavonian <hi>Tongue. The writings of theſe Fathers are expounded amongſt them; they have no other Sentiments than thoſe which Nature imprints in their Minds.</hi> Will not a man be apt to ſay in reading this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, that this Land is a kind of ſpiritual <hi>Canaan</hi>?</p>
                        <p>BUT what ſignifies diſguiſing of things at this rate? Beſides what I now related touching the Ignorance, and Superſtitions reigning in this Church; we need only obſerve what judgment <hi>Poſſevin</hi> who lived ſeveral years in <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covia</hi> makes of them. <hi>In reſpect of Schiſm,</hi> ſay's he, it <hi>cannot be imagin'd how deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Poſſev. de reb. Moſcov. p. 24.</note> 
                           <hi>they are ingaged in it, holding their Opinions for inviolable Maxims,</hi> or rather, <hi>adding ſtill ſomthing to them, than abating any of them. It is the ſame with the</hi> Moſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites <hi>as with thoſe who once have wandred from the Unity of a Principle, the forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they go, the more they multiply their Errors, juſt as may be obſerved in the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators of our times. The</hi> Moſcovites <hi>having receiv'd their Schiſm from the</hi> Greeks <hi>have departed from 'em, and having no Books, nor Learning they therefore abound with impertinencies.</hi> And yet according to Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> this is the only Country in the World for conſerving a Doctrine already eſtabliſhed, and the leaſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to embrace a new Opinion.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41961:199"/> him, he found the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> had erred from the Doctrine and Ceremonies of the Greek Church; and from that time, they had no more Recourſe to the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> for his Confirmation of the Metropolitain of <hi>Moſcovia.</hi> In another place, he obſerves expreſsly that they differ in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 38.</note> things from the <hi>Latins:</hi> Which cauſed <hi>Sacranus</hi> the Channon of <hi>Cracovia,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Elucid. error. ritus. Ruth. Joan.

                        <p>THIS pretended firmneſs which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> attributes to them, has not hindred the Greek Religion, from being corrupted amongſt them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has it hindred the <hi>Latins</hi> from uſing their utmoſt Endeavors, to introduce their Doctrines amongſt them; nor <hi>Poſſevin</hi> from laying his Deſigns in Order thereunto.

Now can it ſeem ſtrange to us if with all theſe Machins, and by abuſing the Ignorance and ſtupidity of theſe People, they have been made to believe that <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation</hi> is a Doctrine of the Greek Religion, and conſequently one of theirs?

                           <hi>read amongſt them, than the Writings of ſome of the Greek Fathers tranſlated into the</hi> Sclavonian <hi>Language,</hi> does not well agree with what <hi>Poſſevin</hi> tells us, <hi>that they underſtand not any more of the</hi> Sclavonian <hi>Language, than what nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to theirs, or that of</hi> Poland. What ſignifies the reading of Greek Fathers Tranſlated into a Language which the People underſtand not?</p>
                        <p>BUT let us ſee what kind of Proofs Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> brings to Convince us,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41961:199"/> that the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> believe <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> The firſt he Offers is the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of all Authors, that have written on the Religion of this Church, who do not Remark that it differs in this Point from the <hi>Romane:</hi> To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance the Value of this Proof, he Immediately complains that I have not alledged any thing that is Real and Poſitive, whereby to maintain my Theſis. <hi>It is ſtrange,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>that Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>treating of this Matter, ſhould chooſe rather to devine the Opinion of theſe People on weak Conjectures, than to inform himſelf whether he might not meet in ſo many Books, that mention the Religion</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 5. c. 1. P. 425.</note> 
                           <hi>of the</hi> Moſcovites, <hi>real Proofs of what he would willingly find.</hi> He afterwards reproaches me with my Negligence in not reading thoſe Books, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts he has not been guilty of the like, having read whatſoever he could find written on this Subject, eight Authors on one ſide, ſeveral Treatiſes on the other, ſuch as <hi>Poſſevin, Baronius, Raynoldus, Botter, Breerwood, Hornbeck,</hi> and ſeveral others.</p>
                        <p>THERE is no need of this Account. There being no body as I know of that queſtions Mr. <hi>Arnaud's</hi> induſtry; we on the contrary blame him for taking ſo much Pains for nothing. As to my own part believing as I do, that the World do's not much concern it ſelf, whether I am Diligent or Lazy, I ſhall not make this a matter of Debate, only ſay, that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> with all his Reading will be no leſs perplexed than my ſelf, how negligent ſoever I am, ſhould ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of us be put upon the producing of the Teſtimony of one ſingle <hi>Moſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite</hi> Author, that expreſly mentions <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> either one way or other. If then by real Proofs, he means paſſages of the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, I beg of him to ſhew me who are the Authors of this Nation, that have treated of the Myſteries of Chriſtian Religion, for excepting the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>John</hi> the Metropolitain of <hi>Moſcou,</hi> which <hi>Sigiſmond d' Herberſtein</hi> has <note place="margin">Sigiſm. Com. rer. Moſc.</note> publiſhed together with the Canons of another <hi>John,</hi> and the Anſwer of <hi>Niphon</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Novograd,</hi> I know none that have written about Religion, or any thing elſe, and theſe three Pieces aforementioned, are but five pages of Paper in all. But if by theſe real Proofs Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> means the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of thoſe who have deſcribed the Religion of theſe People, his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint has no grounds. We have already told him that Travellers, and thoſe that make Diſcourſes of diſtant Nations, give us ſeldom any other than a general Relation of their Opinions, without deſcending to Particularize what they hold or reject. So that there can be nothing certainly concluded from the ſilence of theſe Authors.</p>
                        <p>IT is to no purpoſe to ſay, that <hi>in the Compariſons they make of Religions, it is always with the Roman Catholick Religion, that they Compare all others, and that</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 5. c. 1. P. 427.</note> 
                           <hi>in this Compariſon, the Principal differences are deſigned to be marked out.</hi> For ſuppoſing they all of 'em took this Courſe, it is certain they muſt reduce all theſe <hi>Principal differences,</hi> to thoſe which ſpring from an expreſs and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Oppoſition, wherein on one hand the <hi>Roman</hi> Church profeſſes to believe ſuch a Point, and the Church which is compared with it, profeſſes on the contrary to oppoſe and reject it. So that we muſt not wonder if thoſe that have diſcourſed of the Religion of the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> have obſerved, that they hold as fabulous the fire of Purgatory, acknowledge not the Authority of the Pope, Communicate under both kinds, and give the Communion to Children, and yet have not obſerved that they do not hold <hi>Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Theſe Points are openly controverted between the <hi>Greek</hi> Church of which the <hi>Moſcovite</hi> makes a part, and the <hi>Latine,</hi> but that of <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> is not ſo. They do not teach it, neither yet do they make thereof a point of Controverſie.</p>
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:41961:200"/>
                        <p>IF there can be any advantage drawn from the ſilence of theſe Authors it falls to me. For being moſt of them <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> and knowing well the Importance of this Article, and how greatly controverted in our Weſtern parts, there is no Likely-hood if they had found it held, eſtabliſhed, and taught amongſt the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> but they would remark as much, on purpoſe to gratifie in this the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and indeavour to clear it from the reproach of Innovation; neither muſt Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> imagine, that he is the only Perſon that had in his Eye the Schiſmatical Churches for the defence of the controverted Points in our <hi>Europe.</hi> Theſe aforementioned Authors are not wanting to tell us of the Devotion which theſe People have for I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, the worſhip they give their Saints, their Prayers for the Dead, their faſtings, Monks, Confeſſion, extream Unction, and in a word of all particulars wherein they are agreed with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and are contrary to the Proteſtants. How then comes it to paſs they have forgotten that of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation</hi>? It is to no purpoſe for Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to ſay, that they do not particularly Remark the Articles of the Trinity, the Incarnation, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Death of Chriſt, nor the others in the Creed, for beſides that this is not abſolutely true, there being ſome of theſe Authors, who declare the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> hold <hi>Athanaſius</hi>'s Creed, and the ſeven firſt Councils, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Doctrine of the Trinity, the Incarnation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Beſides this I ſay, theſe Articles are not debated between the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as the others are, and eſpecially that of the Converſion of Subſtances.</p>
                        <p>BUT ſay's Mr. <hi>Arnaud, we will ſhew Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>that they are not all of 'em ſilent on this Point, there being ſome that clearly affirm the</hi> Moſcovites <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 426.</note> 
                           <hi>hold</hi> Tranſubſtantiation. Which we are to Examine. He tells us then, that <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> having obſerved they reject Purgatory, and diſown the Popes Supremacy, and follow the <hi>Greeks</hi> Ceremonies, <hi>makes a general Concluſion concerning all the other Articles, that they hold the ſame as we do: In caeteris Eadem, quae a nobis de Religione ſentiuntur conſtan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                           <hi>important enough to be comprehended under this general Propoſition.</hi> Were this a right conſequence it would likewiſe follow hence, that the <hi>Moſcovite</hi> Prieſts do not marry no more than thoſe of the <hi>Latins,</hi> for <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> ſay's nothing of that. It would follow they baptized not with three Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſions, and hold all other Baptiſm to be of none Effect, for <hi>Paulus Jovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> does not remark this. Neither does he any more take Notice, that they reject the Confirmation of a Biſhop, hold faſting on Saturday to be a great Crime, abhor the eating of Creatures ſtrangled, and yet theſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are as important in reſpect of the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> as any others, ſeeing they make them principal Controverſies, not being able to bear with them that are of contrary Opinions. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> muſt not be ſo quick at drawing Conſequences, or imagine that <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> has been ſo exact in all that <note place="margin">Paul Jovius Com. de legat. Moſc.</note> he has written concerning the <hi>Moſcovites.</hi> For he tells us, they have St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s works, St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s, St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s, where St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s tranſlated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Sclavonian</hi> Tongue, and highly reſpect them; and <hi>Poſſevin</hi> the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite tells us, <hi>that having made an exact inquiry into this particular, he could find no ſuch thing, neither believes the Name of theſe Authors is known to</hi>

                           <hi>SACRANUS</hi> a Chanon of <hi>Cracovia,</hi> adds Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> who gives us
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41961:200"/> the largeſt Catalogue he could of the Errors of the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> ſay's touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eigth Error. <hi>That according to the</hi> Moſcovites, <hi>the Body of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>

                           <hi>Chriſt cannot be Conſecrated with Azymes,</hi> and on the ſixteenth Error. <hi>That they cut a Morſel of the Bread prepar'd for the Sacrifice into the form of a Triangle, and Conſecrate it to make thereof the Body of our Saviour Chriſt, in Corpus Chriſti conſecrant,</hi> and in the eighteenth Error, <hi>Conſecrant panem in Corpus Chriſti.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>'TIS certain Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> makes a ſmall matter ſerve for a Proof. The <hi>Moſcovites</hi> Conſecrate the Bread, <hi>in Corpus Chriſti, into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, or to be the Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> They believe then <hi>Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> 'Tis evident for the Eſtabliſhing of this Concluſion, there is need of <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> ſomething more preciſe than this. <hi>But,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>this is a Catholick that ſpeaks thus, and who would be underſtood to ſpeak of the real Body of Jeſus Chriſt, that attributes this ſame Belief to the</hi> Moſcovites. When <hi>Sacranus</hi> or any other that profeſſes the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion ſpeaks as from himſelf, and the queſtion concerns his own Faith, we can eaſily believe that in a Diſcourſe of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> by the Body of Chriſt, he means the proper ſubſtance of this Body, for we know that this is the Sence, and Style of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. But when he Diſcourſes of the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> and the queſtion concerns their Faith, we believe that in ſaying they Conſecrate the Bread <hi>in Corpus Chriſti,</hi> he pretends no more, than to uſe the ſame Terms which the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> uſe, without concerning himſelf with the Senſe in which they take theſe words. They muſt be taken in the Senſe the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> give 'em. What Senſe is that? This <hi>Sacranus</hi> does not determine, and to go about to decide it, by what <hi>Sacranus</hi> himſelf believed concerning the Sacrament is a meer Illuſion.</p>
                        <p>AS to what <hi>John le Ferre</hi> Confeſſor to the Arch-Duke <hi>Ferdinand</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Moſcovit.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> 
                           <hi>that the Conſecration is performed amongſt them, by pronouncing our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's words, and that they attribute to them ſo great Vertue, that aſſoon as ever they are uttered by the Prieſt, they believe the Creature gives place to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;</hi> we muſt tell Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> that he does not do fairly in offering us a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous relation, ſuch as is this <hi>le Ferre</hi>'s. This Author aſſures us, <hi>that only the Biſhops amongſt the</hi> Moſcovites <hi>Adminiſter Confirmation, that they do it by the laying on of Hands, in making the ſign of the Croſs, and anointing the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Confirmed on the Forehead. That one of the chief Offices of the Prieſt is to Preach the Goſpel of Chriſt to the People, which they do not only every Sunday, but alſo on the Feſtivals of the Bleſſed Virgin and Apoſtles. That God's Word is Preached and heard with great Devotion. That they certainly hold the Doctrine of Purgatory. Acknowledge the Supremacy of the</hi> Roman <hi>Prelate, as being Chriſt's Vicar, and St.</hi> Peters <hi>Succeſſor. That they freely aſſiſt at Maſs with the</hi> Latins. This is all falſe, as appears by other Relations of theſe People. <note place="margin">Poſſevin Com. 2. de reb. Moſc.</note> And therefore <hi>Poſſevin</hi> has not ſcrupled to reckon this <hi>John le Ferre</hi> amongſt thoſe Authors, which are counted fabulous, <hi>becauſe,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>they have been miſ-informed, or did not write with a Deſign to diſcover the Venom, to apply thereunto a Remedy.</hi> What ſignifies then ſuch peoples Teſtimony.</p>
                        <p>NOT to take notice that theſe Terms, <hi>The Creature gives place to the Creator,</hi> are not ſufficient to make us conclude from hence <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> It being a general Expreſſion capable of divers Senſes. For when we ſhould ſay with <hi>Theodoret,</hi> that the Divine Grace accompanies Nature, or with St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> that the Bread becomes of an Aliment a Sacrament, or with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that it is changed into the Vertue of Chriſt's body, the Creature will ſtill
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41961:201"/> give place to the Creator without any Converſion of ſubſtance. So that howſoever we take <hi>John le Ferre</hi>'s Teſtimony 'tis invalid; and does not at all help Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Cauſe. But he having made a general Collection of good and bad Authors, <hi>John le Ferre</hi> muſt have his place amongſt the reſt.</p>
                        <p>I Confeſs that <hi>Laſicius</hi> the Polander that relates this Teſtimony, has taken it in the Sence of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and as we need not doubt but that the Deſign of <hi>John le Ferre,</hi> was to make the World believe that the <hi>Moſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> hold this Doctrine, ſo likewiſe we muſt not find it ſtrange if thoſe that refer themſelves to his Authority, as <hi>Laſicius</hi> has done, do take it no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. Had <hi>Laſicius</hi> well examined this Relation of <hi>John le Ferre</hi>'s, he would have found it full of falſe Reports, and eaſily find his Authors main De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was to render the <hi>Moſcovite</hi> Religion, as Conformable as he could to the <hi>Roman;</hi> and by this means to deceive his Readers, and eſpecially, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants whom he had at that time in his Eye. He would then have abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejected the Authority of ſuch a Man, who has palpably diſguiſed the Truth: He might at leaſt diſtinguiſh in reſpect of the Words in queſtion, <hi>Ferre</hi>'s Sence, from the Sence of the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> themſelves, ſuppoſing they were their own Words. But this he has not done, altho he ought to have done it, and thence it is that on this bare Teſtimony without any other Proof, <hi>Laſicius</hi> has believed that the Opinion of the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> leaned towards <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> Whence it follows, we ought not lightly to Credit whatſoever a ſuſpected Author ſhall tell us, concerning the Religion of Strangers, but it does not follow 'tis true in the main, that the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Converſion of Subſtances.</p>
                        <p>WE muſt then come to the Teſtimonies of <hi>Dannaverus</hi> profeſſor of <hi>Strasburg,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Olearius</hi> the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi>'s Library-Keeper; Perſons of greater Reputation. Both ſay the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> hold <hi>Tranſubſtantiation: They put,</hi> ſay's <hi>Dannaverus, into the Wine contained in the Chalice, the Bread broken into pieces; they Bleſs it, and believe 'tis Tranſubſtantiated. They hold</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation ſay's Mr. <hi>Olearius.</hi> So that here we have two expreſs Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and againſt which it ſeems there can be nothing alledged. As to <hi>Dannaverus,</hi> he has only followed <hi>Olearius</hi>'s Authority, knowing no more of the Religion of the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> than what he has receiv'd from the reading of Authors, as appears by his Treatiſe. But as to Mr. <hi>Olearius,</hi> he is a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of great Learning, and has lived in thoſe Countries, and made it his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be informed of this Point, and who not only gives us this Account in his Book, but has likewiſe Confirm'd it, in a Letter written to one of Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi>'s Friends upon occaſion of this preſent Diſpute, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has not failed to make thereof a matter of Triumph.</p>
                        <p>IT will be no hard matter to reply to Mr. <hi>Olearius</hi>'s Teſtimony, and clear it from all Perplexity. And this will be done by conſidering his own <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Perpe.</hi> of the Faith <hi>Part 3. C.</hi> 8.</note> Words, as well in his Book as Letter. Thoſe in his Book as the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> relates them, from the Original High-Dutch are, <hi>They believe</hi> Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>that is to ſay, that the Bread and Wine are really changed into the Body and Blood of our Saviour Chriſt.</hi> Thoſe of his Letter <note place="margin">Lib. 5. C. 3. P. 438.</note> related by Mr. <hi>Arnaud: I wrote expreſly in the Relation of my Voyage, that the</hi> Moſcovites <hi>hold</hi> Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>that is to ſay, they believe the Bread is changed into the Body of Chriſt, and the Wine into his Blood.</hi> Diſtinguiſh then Mr. <hi>Olearius</hi>'s Teſtimony, from his private Judgment, and you'l clear the Difficulty. His Teſtimony is, that the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> believe the Bread and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41961:201"/> Wine are changed into the Body and Blood of Chriſt which he has deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by theſe Terms, <hi>which is to ſay that they believe the bread to be changed into the Body of Jeſus Christ, and the Wine into his Blood.</hi> His private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is that this may be termed the belief of Tranſubſtantiation, which he ſignifies by theſe following words. <hi>They hold Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>SO that the whole of this Teſtimony amounts to no more than the change of the Bread into the Body, and the Wine into the Blood, and his ſaying that they believe Tranſubſtantiation has no other grounds than his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſawſion that this is in effect a converſion of Subſtance. He does not attribute this to them but under the favour of his <hi>that is to ſay, They hold Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that is to ſay, the Bread is changed into the Body of Chriſt, and the Wine into his Blood.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THIS <hi>that is to ſay</hi> explains what he means, and punct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually determines what the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> hold. If to <hi>change</hi> and <hi>tranſubſtantiate</hi> are one and the ſame thing, his Propoſition muſt be received in its full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, if they are not, the <hi>Change</hi> belongs to the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> the <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier</hi> to the private ſence of <hi>M. Olearius.</hi> We then reſpectfully receive his Teſtimony without the leaſt queſtion of his ſincerity; but as to his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Judgement, we hope he will be ſo equitable as to lay no neceſſity upon us to receive it. For ſhould we judge otherwiſe then he has done he will have no juſt cauſe to be angry. Neither had he any reaſon to be offended <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Anſwer to the</hi> Perp. Part 3. C. 8.</note> at the Anſwer I made the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity. That 'tis very likely he was miſtaken by falſe conjectures, and that having heard of the change of Bread, he imagined this was the change of Subſtance.</hi> which is the ſame thing I ſay now. The diſtinction which I make between his Teſtimony and his Judgment is grounded on his own proper Terms, and the liberty which I pretend to have of rejecting the one and receiving the other is no more than what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Juſtice will allow me. I can therefore ſee no reaſon for his ſtuffing his Letter with rough and paſſionate expreſſions, which agree not well with the Character he bears, and which I ſuppoſe he has learned of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous People he has ſo long converſed with. Why would he have us believe, the change of Bread into the Body is the Tranſubſtantiation of the <hi>Latins,</hi> ſeeing we find on the contrary that this is the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> of which expreſſion we have ſo often already manifeſted the ſence; The <hi>Moſcovites</hi> follow the Greek Religion we grant, the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſay the Bread is changed, the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> affirm the ſame, the Queſtion is only whether <hi>to change</hi> is the ſame as to <hi>tranſubſtantiate.</hi> Now I have plainly diſplayed the difference betwixt theſe two Terms in reference to the <hi>Greeks;</hi> we muſt then conclude the ſame in reſpect of the <hi>Moſcovites.</hi> It appears from M. <hi>Olearius</hi> his own Relation what we are to conclude touching his exactneſs. For in the ſame place where he tells us the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> believe Tranſubſtantiation, he adds, <hi>that the reſt of the conſecrated Bread ſerves for Panis Benedictus.</hi> Now this would be a great impiety to make this the proper Subſtance of the body of Chriſt, but even in this he is miſtaken, for what ſerves amongſt theſe People for <hi>Panis Benedictus</hi> is only the Remains of the Bread from whence is taken the great Particle which is afterwards conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and called the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and not the Remains of the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Bread.</p>
                        <p>BUT to oppoſe againſt the private Judgment of M. <hi>Olearius</hi> ſomething yet more preciſe, I need only here relate what the Author of the Relation
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41961:202"/> of the three Ambaſſages of M. <hi>Carlile</hi> wrote on this Subject. 'Tis the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of an Honorable Perſon, who lived a conſiderable time in thoſe parts, and ſince M. <hi>Olearius,</hi> who wanted neither Judgment, Sincerity, nor Curioſity to inform himſelf and us touching the belief of theſe people, in reference to <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> without the leaſt regard to the Diſpute between Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> and my ſelf, as having no other deſign then that of <note place="margin">Relat. of the <hi>Ambaſ.</hi> of M. <hi>Carlile.</hi>
                           </note> diſcovering the Truth. <hi>Moreover,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I could not find by 'em what</hi> Olearius <hi>mentions, namely, that they hold</hi> Tranſubſtantiation: <hi>and there are three Reaſons inducing me to believe thty are not of this Opinion. For firſt, when we diſcourſe with them, touching the Conſequences of this Doctrine, they teſtifie their diſlike of it: and to maintain it, fly not to the Almighty power of God as the</hi> Roman <hi>Catholicks do. 2. 'Tis more then probable that if they believed</hi> Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>they would reſpect this Myſtery more than they do, and it would be very strange that in ſo ſuperſtitious a Religion as theirs is, they ſhould be behind hand in Zeal and Devotion, eſpecially in a particular wherein it ought chiefly to appear, as we ſee it does amongſt thoſe of the Church of</hi> Rome. <hi>In fine, had they that Opinion which</hi> Olearius <hi>attributes to them, they muſt have it from the Greeks from whom they have received their Doctrines. But we do not find the</hi> Greeks <hi>were of this Opiwion.</hi> Let Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> then himſelf judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he may reaſonably expect to prevail by means of Mr. <hi>Olearius</hi> his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
                        <p>WE come now to the Teſtimony of <hi>Payſius Ligaridius,</hi> but having already conſidered it in the foregoing Book, we ſhall trouble our ſelves no farther with him. 'Tis not to be doubted but the ſame thing may be done in <hi>Muſcovia</hi> as in <hi>Greece,</hi> that is to ſay there may be perſons brought in and ſettl'd there who finiſh'd their Studies in ſome of the Seminaries erected for this purpoſe. 'Tis certain whoſoever ſhall addreſs himſelf to theſe Perſons (who are not only bred up in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſworn to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it's Confeſſion of Faith, but ſent on purpoſe to communicate it to others, prevailing by means of their Ignorance) whether ſoever they be, whether in <hi>Muſcovia</hi> or <hi>Greece,</hi> their Teſtimony ſhall not be wanting. But every body knows the Value of them. Let us paſs on then to the <hi>Moſcovite</hi> Prieſt, that accompanied, not long ſince the great Dukes Ambaſſador to his Majeſty of <hi>France,</hi> who <hi>after Dinner,</hi> as 'tis ſay'd, at the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Sens,</hi> was deſired to declare what the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> held concerning the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt.</hi> There may be ſeveral conſiderable Reflexions made on this Relation; but not to enter into particulars, I ſay the Teſtimony of this Perſon is not ſufficiently Authentick to decide our Queſtion. We have already ſeen by Mr. <hi>Olearius</hi> his Relation that the <hi>Moſcovit</hi> Prieſts are ſo ignorant in general <hi>that there is ſcarcely any amongſt them can give an account of their faith, or knows the Religion profeſſed in other Countries.</hi> Theſe are two Characters that do not well agree with the uſe which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would make of this Prieſt. For to determine whether <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> be an Article of the <hi>Moſcovite</hi> Religion, it ought to be known on one hand what it is the <hi>Latins</hi> call <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> what they ſay and believe of it, and on the other, what the <hi>Moſcovite</hi> Religion aſſerts touching the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> 'Tis no hard matter to make an ignorant Prieſt that ſpeaks of a change of Bread into the Body of Chriſt believe tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> he acknowledges a <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> But not to wander from the point in hand, there is all the likelyhood in the World that that which paſſed at the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Sens</hi> is a meer Illuſion. To judge of it we need only attentively conſider the Expreſſions of the Relation which <note place="margin">Lib 12. P. 75.</note> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has produced. <hi>After Dinner they withdrew into the Arch-Biſhops</hi>
                           <pb n="11" facs="tcp:41961:202"/> 
                           <hi>Chamber, where we began to Diſcourſe them touching the different Cuſtoms of their Church, touching their Patriarchs Communion with the other</hi> Grcek <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, concerning Faſtings, Caelibacy, Prayer, their Liturgy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But in fine the Arch-Biſhop deſirous to come to the main Point of which he was moſt deſirous to be informed, prayed the Interpreter to tell him word for word what he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to demand; having laid this ſtrict charge on the Interpreter, he deſired them to tell him their Opinion concerning the Sacrament of the</hi> Euchariſt. <hi>The</hi> Moſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite <hi>Prieſt anſwers without the leaſt haeſitation (which a little ſurprized us, for he had hither to ſtood as it were upon his Guard, as if he had feared the engaging too far in ſome point of Controverſie, leſt he might thereby endanger his Reputation) That it was the real Body and Blood of Chriſt, and that after the Prieſt had ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered theſe words of our Saviour, this is my Body; the Bread is changed into the Body of Christ, and having ſaid the ſame in reſpect of the Cup, the Wine is changed into his Blood. When the Interpreter had ſaid this, the Arch-Biſhop bad him tell him exactly word for word what the Prieſt had told him. The Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter told the</hi> Moſcovite <hi>Prieſt what the Prelate deſired, whereupon he repeated the ſame words the ſecond time by the Interpreter. And for aſ much as he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that the Bread and Wine were tranſubſtantiated into the Body and Blood of Chriſt, he was asked whether the</hi> Moſcovite <hi>Prieſt uſed a word which in his Language had the force of that of</hi> Tranſubſtantiated <hi>in ours. He replyed, yes, and repeated the</hi> Moſcovite <hi>word which ſignifies this, in looking on the Prieſt and Secretary, who both of them made Signs that this word was proper in their tongue and ſignified a change of Subſtance.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE reſult of this Diſcourſe is 1. That the Prieſt ſaid 'twas the real Body and Blood of Chriſt, and that the Bread was changed into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Wine into his Blood. 2. That he repeated only the ſame words the ſecond time. 3. That the Interpreter added, that the Bread and Wine are tranſubſtantiated. 4. That it was the Interpreter that profeſt the <hi>Moſcovite</hi> word had the force of that of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> 5. That for a farther Confirmation, touching the force of the Word, he required the Prieſt's and Secretary's conſent by a bare look, without ſpeaking to them. 6. That the Prieſt and Secretary anſwered him by a ſign without ſpeaking. 7. That this ſign ſignified this word was proper in their Tongue and ſignified a change of Subſtance.</p>
                        <p>IT is to be obſerved that this Interpreter was a Monk, not of the <hi>Moſcovite</hi> Religion, but the <hi>Roman;</hi> and of the order of <hi>Jacobins,</hi> and that he explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in French what the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> ſaid in his Language, and in <hi>Moſcovit</hi> what <hi>M.</hi> the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Sens</hi> ſaid in <hi>French,</hi> for the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> underſtood no more the <hi>French,</hi> than the <hi>French</hi> the <hi>Moſcovit.</hi> Upon this remark which is beyond controul, for 'tis a matter of Fact well known throughout all <hi>Paris,</hi> I deſire Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to tell me why this Interpreter having returned the Anſwer of the <hi>Moſcovite</hi> Prieſt, which he twice repeated in the ſame Terms without any Alteration, when he had I ſay given it in theſe words, the <hi>Bread is changed into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Wine into his Blood,</hi> wherefore did he add that the Bread and Wine were tranſubſtantiated? Wherefore when he was asked whether the Prieſt uſed a Word which in his Tongue had the force of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> did he demand by a bare look the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Prieſt and Secretary to the <hi>Yes,</hi> which he anſwered, ſeeing the Prieſt and Secretary who underſtood not <hi>French,</hi> neither underſtood the <hi>Tranſubſtantiated</hi> which he added, nor the Queſtion put to the Interpreter, nor the <hi>Yes,</hi> he anſwered? Do they in <hi>Muſcovia</hi> ſpeak by ſings or were
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41961:203"/> they agreed before hand that this look ſhould ſignifie <hi>tranſubſtantiated?</hi> How could the Prieſt and Secretary anſwer to that which they did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, why by ſigns, and why muſt this ſign which anſwered a very obſcure Queſtion, ſignifie <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi>? Certainly we are but ſorry people here in the Weſt in compariſon of theſe <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> that can treat of one of the moſt important Articles of Religion by ſigns and nodds, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the point in queſtion; had Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> and I learnt this Secret our Diſpute would not be ſo tedious. Now if this be not deluſory I know not any thing that I can call by that name.</p>
                        <p>'TIS certain the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> profeſs to follow the <hi>Greek</hi> Religion although they have in ſome ſort altered it. Which I told the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> and this I did not aſſert upon light grounds, although Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is pleaſed to ſay I did; ſeeing I ſaid no more than what he himſelf acknowledges. This is a common Principle to us both, 'tis true, we draw hence different conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, but as matters are now ſtated and cleared, any man may eaſily judge which of us two has beſt grounded his Sentiment.</p>
                        <p>I ſaid likewiſe that <hi>Laſicius</hi> affirms the <hi>Armenians</hi> although they deny <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> yet do reverence the Sacrament more religiouſly than the <hi>Ruſſians;</hi> whence I drew this Concluſion, that 'twas not likely the <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Anſwer to the</hi> P. 3. C. 8.</note> latter of theſe who are more cold in their Devotion ſhould extend their Belief farther than the others, and that the others ſhould have more reſpect for a Subſtance of Bread than theſe ſhould have for what they eſteemed the proper Subſtance of the Son of God. I know not what could oblige Mr. <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. C. 4. P. 448s</note> 
                           <hi>Arnaud</hi> to ſay, <hi>That it is ſcarcely to be imagined how many Diſguiſements and Falſities there are in this Argument.</hi> I deſigned no more by all this than the drawing of a juſt Conſequence from a True Principle. 'Tis certain that <hi>Laſicius</hi> ſay's two things, the one that the <hi>Armenians</hi> of <hi>Leopolis</hi> deny the Bread and Wine loſe their Nature, <hi>In Sacramento Euchariſtae elementa Naturas ſuas amittere negant.</hi> Theſe are his words, the other <note place="margin">Joan. Lazic. <hi>Relig. Arm.</hi>
                           </note> that they reverence the Sarcament more religiouſly than the <hi>Ruſſians, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum religioſius Ruſſis venerantur,</hi> theſe are alſo his words. Whence I conclude 'tis not likely the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> or <hi>Moſcovites</hi> believe <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> the reaſon is ſufficiently evident, to wit, that thoſe that believe the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be the proper Subſtance of the Son of God, cannot but ſhew it more Reſpect than thoſe that believe it to be a Subſtanee of Bread.</p>
                        <p>IT is to no purpoſe for Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to ſay, <hi>that my Argument ſuppoſes</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. C. 4. P. 448.</note> 
                           <hi>according to this Author, the</hi> Armenians <hi>do neither hold the real Preſence, nor</hi> Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>and that if I do not ſuppoſe this, nothing can be leſs reaſonable than my Diſcourſe. For if the</hi> Armenians, adds he, <hi>together with the Subſtance of Bread do moreover admit the real preſence of Chriſt, it is no wiſe improbable but that they have a greater reſpect for the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>than thoſe that do not admit this Subſtance of Bread. The reſpect of the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>comes only from the Preſence of Chriſt: and the preſence or abſence of the Bread contributes not any thing thereunto.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I hope Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will not be offended if I tell him that his Authority is not yet great enough in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to counter-ballance that of <hi>Thomas Aquinas.</hi> Now <hi>Thomas</hi> his Doctrine is directly oppoſite to his, <hi>Contrariatur,</hi> ſay's this Author, <hi>venerationi hujus Sacramenti ſi aliqua</hi>
                           <pb n="13" facs="tcp:41961:203"/> 
                           <hi>Subſtantia creata eſſet ibi quae non poſſet Adoratione latriae adorari. 'Twould be</hi>

                           <hi>contrary to the Veneration due to this Sacrament, were there any created Subſtance in it to which may not be given the adoration of Latria.</hi> Now let any man if he can make this agree with what <hi>Mr. Arnaud</hi> ſays: <hi>Mr. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi>'s Propoſition ſay's that the reſpect due to the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> proceeds only from the preſence of Chriſt, and that the preſence or abſence of the Bread does not at all contribute thereunto, and <hi>Thomas</hi> aſſures us on the contrary that if the Subſtance of bread were preſent, it would hinder the Adoration of this Sacrament, whence it follows according to him, that thoſe that hold the Subſtance of Bread ceaſes to be, ought more to reverence the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than thoſe that believe it remains. So that whether the <hi>Armenians</hi> do or do not believe the real preſence this ſignifies nothing to my Argument. 'Tis clear according to <hi>Laſicius</hi> that they do not believe <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and conſequently 'tis clear according to <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> that they hold an opinion which is contrary to the veneration of the Sacrament, yet do they adore the Sacrament more religiouſly than the <hi>Moſcovites.</hi> How then can the belief of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> be attributed to the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> for if they held this Doctrine they muſt have a greater veneration for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than the others. This Argument cannot be otherwiſe denyed than by oppoſing the Doctrine of <hi>Thomas Aquinas.</hi> So that with drawing my ſelf out of the Liſts I ſhall offer in my ſtead either Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> to be handled by Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> by Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> that is to ſay, the Maſter by the Diſciple or the Diſciple by the Maſter.</p>
                        <p>MOREOVER our Queſtion touching the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> relating only to <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> 'tis evident it would be a Digreſſion from the Point in hand to diſcuſs the intire paſſage of <hi>Laſicius</hi> to know whether he imputes to the <hi>Armenians</hi> the belief of the real Preſence. It will appear by what we ſhall ſay in the following Chapters what we may judge of them touching this particular. The Queſtion now concerns only the <hi>Moſcovites;</hi> and what <hi>Laſicius</hi> ſays concerning their worſhipping leſs religiouſly the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than the <hi>Armenians</hi> is uncontroulable, conſidering the teſtimonies we have produced in the ſecond Book, of <hi>Sacranus</hi> a Chanon of <hi>Cracovia, John de Laſco</hi> Arch Biſhop of <hi>Gneſne,</hi> and <hi>Scarga</hi> the <hi>Jeſuite;</hi> who expreſsly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> of whom the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> are a part, do indeed adore the Bread before its conſecration, but afterwards ſhew it no reſpect nor ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, ſcattering the Crums thereof on the ground. It is to no purpoſe for Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to ſay that that which hinders them from giving the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt</hi> after conſecration an external honour is, that the Conſecration is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in a place ſeparate from the people, and that 'tis out of reſpect to the Sacrament that the People are deprived for ſome time of the ſight of this Myſtery 'Tis evident theſe are mere Subter fuges. Did they worſhip the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with an internal adoration, they would declare as much themſelves, and eaſe Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> of the trouble of ſearching their Secret thoughts. They would ſhew it by ſome expreſſion of external Reverence, and for this effect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Sacrament to the Eyes of the People, the People would at leaſt make profeſſion of adoring it before they received it, and the Prieſts would adore it in the Sanctuary when they had conſecrated it. Yet do theſe Authors abſolutely ſay that they give it no adoration. <hi>This,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. C. 1. <hi>Pag.</hi> 432.</note> 
                           <hi>is not ſo, for</hi> Oderbornus <hi>tells us that the Prieſt comes from the Sanctuary and walking leaſurely ſhows the People that which he has conſecrated in ſecret: that then the People fall down on their Knees the Prieſt ſaying to 'em in the</hi> Moſcovit <hi>Language, Behold the Body and Blood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt whom the</hi>
                           <pb n="14" facs="tcp:41961:204"/> Jews <hi>unjuſtly put to death.</hi> But we have ſhewed in the third Book when we treated of the Adoration of the Sacrament that <hi>Oderborn</hi> is apparently miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, having taken a Ceremony which is uſed before the conſecration of the Bread, as if it were uſed after this Conſecration. The <hi>Moſcovites</hi> even as the <hi>Greeks</hi> do but once ſhew the People the Bread and Wine, taking one turn round the Church before the Conſecration, which they call the great Entrance. If Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> knows not this he is ignorant of a Matter well known by others, and if he does know it, he ſhews little ſincerity, in deſigning to prevail over us by means of <hi>Oderborn</hi>'s miſtake.</p>

The Teſtimony of <hi>Abraham Echellenſis</hi> is of no credit, and I refer my ſelf thereupon to <hi>Gahriel Sionita</hi> his Country man who has ſet him forth as an ignorant and impertinent Fellow, a Lyer and Impoſtor.

He reproaches him with his dividing the whole Seminary at <hi>Rome,</hi> for his treachery to the Patriarch of the <hi>Maronites;</hi> impoſing on Prince <hi>Fachraddin,</hi> for cheating the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> and with his being baniſhed his own Country, his Impriſonment at <hi>Florence</hi> for his Crimes, and in fine threatens him for the compleating of his ſhame to Print thoſe Letters he received from Mount <hi>Liban, Rome,</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> which give an Account of his Life. But beſides there is not any thing in theſe paſſages but may well agree with the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> ſuch as we have ſhewed it to be in the two fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Books as will appear to him that ſhall take the pains to read them in Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Book, and apply to them the Anſwers I made to ſeveral

                        <p>WEE muſt come then to the <hi>Armenians,</hi> I ſhall inſiſt the longer upon them as well for that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has diſcourſed much about them, as for that they are a great people, and an entire Church by themſelves.

                        <p>THE <hi>Latins</hi> have long ſince uſed their utmoſt power to bring over theſe <hi>Armenians</hi> to 'um, and ſubmit them to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> They have for this purpoſe ſent Miſſions which they have renewed, or augmented as Occaſion required. They have taken the courſe of Seminaries, and from time to time accordingly managed the Intereſts of Princes and Kings of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and that not ſeldom with Succeſs. So that as there are at preſent two ſorts of <hi>Greeks,</hi> the one called the reunited ones, and the other Schiſmaticks; ſo there are likewiſe two ſorts of <hi>Armenians</hi> the one that acknowledges the Authority of the Pope called <hi>Frank-Armenians,</hi> for in the Eaſt they call all the <hi>Latins</hi> of whatſoever Nation they be <hi>Franks;</hi> the others thoſe that acknowledge only their own Patriarchs, or <hi>Catholicks</hi> as they term them, and are called only <hi>Armenians.</hi>

                        <p>OUR Queſtion only then concerns theſe laſt, and to know whether they do, or do not believe <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> The firſt Argument I offer for the maintaining the Negative which I affirm, is, that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is inconſiſtent with the Hereſie of <hi>Euthyches</hi> of which the <hi>Armenians</hi> make profeſſion. They hold there is but one ſingle Nature in Jeſus Chriſt, which is the Divine, that the humane Nature was mixt or confuſed in the Eſſence of the Divinity. How then is it poſſible that having this Opinion they can at the ſame time believe the Subſtance of Bread to be changed into the Subſtance of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt? For if our Saviour Chriſt has no longer a Body, if the humane Nature do's no longer ſubſiſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to them, this would be to charge them with the greateſt Abſurdity, that is to ſay, a manifeſt contradiction, to imagine they believe the change in Queſtion; ſeeing to believe it, it muſt be neceſſarily ſuppoſed, not only that our Saviour Chriſt has a Body, but likewiſe that his Body is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the Divinity.</p>

                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> who ſaw the Force of this Argument would prevent it <note place="margin">Lib. 5. C. 6. P. 454.</note> by two Anſwers, which we muſt diſtinctly examine one after another. The firſt amounts to this, <hi>That ſuppoſing the</hi> Armenians <hi>were real</hi> Eutychiens, <hi>yet do's it not thence follow that their Opinion is inconſiſtent with</hi> Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, <hi>or that they do not admit it after their Faſhion. For although they ſay there was but one Nature in our Saviour Chriſt after the Union, and that the Human Nature was ſwallowed up by the Divine, yet do they aſſert that the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>brought forth a Son that appeared to have a Body like other men; that the Apostles converſed with our Saviour as a man, that the</hi> Jews <hi>took him for a man, that they crucified him as a man.</hi> Whence he concludes that this ſwallowing up of the Humane Nature conſiſted rather according to the <hi>Eutychiens, in the change of all the Natural proprieties which they called Nature, than in the annihilation of Nature it ſelf taken for the Subſtance and internal being. That this manifeſtly appears by all their Writings who have undertaken to refute the</hi> Eutychiens, <hi>and by the</hi> Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiens <hi>themſelves. For the</hi> Gajanites <hi>who are</hi> Eutychiens <hi>at farthest diſtance from the Catholick, yet acknowledge they receive in the holy Communion the very Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, and who was incarnate, and born of the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>the Mother of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>APPLYING this afterwards to the Queſtion of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> he ſay's, <hi>that they believe with all other Chriſtians, that this ſame Jeſus Chriſt born of the Virgin, ſeen in the World, crucified, and riſen, is really preſent in the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>that the Bread is really changed into this Jeſus Christ. But denying as they do, that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt was a diſtinct Nature from the Divinity, ſo they will not allow the Bread which is tranſubſtantiated into Jeſus Chriſt to be any other Nature than the Divinity, that is to ſay, a deified Body, a Body mixt and confuſed with the Divinity by the loſs of it's natural Proprieties rather than of its Subſtance.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> do's likewiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe us that in the Examination of what <hi>Theodoret</hi> has written he will more diſtinctly explain wherein conſiſts this ſwallowing up of the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture according to the <hi>Eutychiens.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I know not what elucidations he may one day give us, but if they be no better then what he now tells us, they will be of no great uſe, for 'tis certain there was never a more crude diſcourſe than that which he now gives us: Firſt, What ſignifies the telling us that the <hi>Eutychiens</hi> acknowledged the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> brought forth a Son that appeared to have a Body like other men, that the Apoſtles converſed with him, as with a man, and that the <hi>Jews</hi> took him for a man? what ſignifies this to the proving that they did not deny the inward ſubſtance of the Humanity remained in Jeſus Chriſt, but ſaid only that all the natural Proprieties which they call Nature was changed? There would be more likelyhood in concluding from hence the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that according to the <hi>Eutychiens</hi> the inward Subſtance was changed, and the natural Proprieties remained; for if we really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh theſe Proprieties, from the Subſtance, it is immediately on them and not on the inward Subſtance, whereon depends ones being a man, and being taken for ſuch. So that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> in ſaying the Apoſtles converſed with our Saviour as a man, and that the <hi>Jews</hi> took him for a man, eſtabliſhes a principle which not only concludes nothing of what he pretends but rather the contrary, which does ſhew in my opinion that he was in great perplexity when he wrote this Chapter. 2. Do's he not know that the <hi>Eutychiens,</hi> and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41961:205"/> eſpecially the <hi>Armenians</hi> when they are urged by paſſages of Scripture which attribute to our Saviour Chriſt all the out-ward Characters of a real Man, that he was born, converſed with his Apoſtles, eat and drank, was dead and riſen again, that his Soul was oppreſſed with ſadneſs, &amp;c. whence we conclude he had a real humane Nature, anſwered, that all theſe things happened only in appearance, and that it was the Divinity it ſelf that aſſumed all theſe External Forms, which yet had in themſelves no reality.

                        <p>III. WERE their Sentiment ſuch as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſuppoſes it to be, how comes it to paſs they have never declared as much? Whence is it they have ever ſay'd the humane Nature was ſwallowed up by the Divine, that it was changed into the Divinity, mixt and confuſed with the Divinity, without ever minding to clear up this difficulty in ſaying that by Nature they underſtood not the inward Subſtance, but only all the inward Proprieties, and that they confeſſed this Subſtance remained intire? How comes it that thoſe who diſputed againſt them, or that have related their Errors never made this pretended Diſtinction of Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> nor declared this new Sence in which the word Nature is to be taken, to wit, for all the natural Proprieties, diſtinct and really ſeparate from the inward Subſtance? Whence is it that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> having ſo ſharply inveighed hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore againſt the Equivocations of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> now thinks fit to admit a perpetual one between the <hi>Orthodox</hi> and <hi>Eutychiens,</hi> the one taking the Term of Nature in one Sence, and the other in another, and diſputing ſo many Ages againſt one another without explaining themſelves and underſtanding one another? For it does not appear from Authors that wrote againſt the <hi>Eutychiens,</hi> that they took in this occaſion the term of Nature for the Natural propriety in oppoſition to the inward Subſtance, as it pleaſes Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to ſuppoſe without proof. It appears on the contrary that they have taken it for the Subſtance it ſelf with it's Proprieties. <note place="margin">

Whoſoever believes Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> muſt acknowledge the World has been groſly miſtaken in imagining that the <hi>Eutychiens</hi> aboliſhed the Humane Subſtance in our Saviour Chriſt when they ſay'd the created Nature was ſwallowed up in the Abyſs of the Divinity, whereas according to him by the term of Nature they meant only the Natural Proprieties. And it muſt be moreover ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that the <hi>Eutychiens</hi> have been to this day very blind in not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41961:206"/> diſcovering this miſtake in the Orthodox Chriſtians, and very uncharitable in not indeavouring to undeceive them by a means which would coſt them ſo little.

                        </p>
                        <p>IV. AS to what he tells us concerning the <hi>Gayanites</hi> from the Relation <note place="margin">Lib. 5. C. 6. P. 455.</note> of <hi>Anaſtaſius Sinaite,</hi> that they did howſoever acknowledge we receive in the Communion, <hi>the very Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God incarnate and born of the H. Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>the Mother of God,</hi> there is far greater reaſon to ſay that by this Body they meant a Myſtery which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Body ſwallowed up by the Divinity, than to ſay they meant his very Subſtance. For if what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſay's of them be true that they were Eutychiens <hi>fartheſt off from the Catholicks in their Opinions</hi> we now ſaw that the <hi>Eutychiens</hi> believed not that this Subſtance ſubſiſted diſtinct from the Divinity. Why then ſhall we not expound what <hi>Anaſtaſius Sinaite</hi> makes the <hi>Gayanites</hi> ſay, by what good and conſiderable Authors relate of the <hi>Eutychiens,</hi> rather than to give the lye to theſe Authors, and correct what they ſay by the Diſcourſe of ſuch an impertinent Perſon as <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> himſelf has been forced to deſpiſe in citing him, as appears by what we have ſeen in the preceding Book?</p>
                        <p>THUS have I refuted Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s firſt Anſwer. Let us ſee whether there be any more Strength in his ſecond. It conſiſts in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Lib. 5. C. 6. P. 456.</note> 
                           <hi>that the greateſt part of the</hi> Armenians <hi>were but half</hi> Eutychiens; <hi>that is to ſay, they did not in any wiſe admit the confuſion of Natures, that they condemned</hi> Eutyches, <hi>and that their Error conſiſted only in their refuſing to uſe the Expreſſion of the two Natures, aſſerting our Saviour had but one.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THIS is a Queſtion of fact which muſt be decided by the Teſtimony of Authors. We ſhall ſee hereafter who are thoſe that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> alledges in his favour. We muſt only here obſerve that he unjuſtly exclaims againſt <hi>Euthymius Zigabenius</hi> a <hi>Greek</hi> Monk, and one <hi>Iſaac</hi> a Catholick of <hi>Armenia</hi> who have attributed plainly and harmleſly the Error of <hi>Eutyches</hi> to the <hi>Armenians;</hi> So that at preſent we ſhall lay aſide the Authority of theſe two Perſons, ſeeing he is pleaſed to except againſt them, and betake our ſelves to other Witneſſes for the ending of this difference. Here are others then which are not to be contemned, whether we regard their number or quality. The firſt is a <hi>Greek</hi> Author named St. <hi>Nicon</hi> who lived in the ſeventh Century. There is in the <hi>Bibliotheca Patrum</hi> a Letter or a <note place="margin">
                              <hi>St.</hi> Nicon Epiſt. ad <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſtium.</hi> Bibl. Patr. Tom. 3. edit. 4.</note> Treatiſe of his under the Title, <hi>De peſſimorum</hi> Armeniorum <hi>peſſima Religione.</hi> He exactly enough deſcribes in it the Errors of this Nation, and amongſt others mentions this, <hi>that they hold the confuſion of the two Natures of Jeſus Chriſt, in the Union. Itidem,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>&amp; in duarum Chriſti Naturarum Unione confuſionem decernunt.</hi> He ſay's likewiſe they hold <hi>the Divine Nature is paſſible, that being fallen into the Error of the</hi> Aphtartodocites <hi>they believe the Trinity has ſuffered; and altho they durſt not openly explain themſelves, yet they do plainly intimate it by the things they do, for they take three Croſſes, and faſtning them to a Stake call this the Holy Trinity.</hi> Now here is (according to Mr. <hi>Arnaud)</hi> a third Impoſtor, that falſly accuſes the <hi>Armenians</hi> to believe the confuſion of Natures. He muſt be excluded as well as <hi>Eutychus</hi>
                           <pb n="20" facs="tcp:41961:207"/> and <hi>Iſaac;</hi> but if Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> continues in this captious humor he will never want exceptions againſt Authors.</p>
                        <p>TO <hi>Nicon</hi> we muſt add <hi>Nicephorus Calliſtus</hi> a famous Hiſtorian a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Greeks;</hi> who ſpeaking of theſe ſame <hi>Armenians</hi> refers the original of their Hereſie to one <hi>Jacob</hi> the Author of the Sect of the <hi>Jacobites;</hi> and adds, <hi>ſometimes they ſay the word aſſumed an incorruptible Body, uncreated, heavenly, impaſſible, ſubtile, which is not of the ſame Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with ours, yet has all the Accidents of Fleſh, in appearance and after</hi>

                           <hi>the manner of a ſpectrum. Sometimes likewiſe they affirm the Fleſh of the Word was converted into the Nature of the Divinity, and became conſubſtantial with it. They do for the moſt part deny the Word aſſumed a humane Body of the Virgin, and ſay that having been changed without a Change, and made Fleſh he has only paſſed through the Virgin, and faſtned his Divinity to the Croſs; and altho it be neither finite nor circumſcribed yet he has depoſited it in the Sepulchre. They deny the Birth of Chriſt according to the Fleſh, affirming it hapned in appearance only. In the Celebration of the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>they uſe the Azyme and not Bread.

                        <p>IN the year 1341, the then <hi>Pope</hi> cauſed this Information to be drawn up, touching the Errors of the <hi>Armenians</hi> which we have already mentioned, and ſhall have farther occaſion to diſcourſe of hereafter. The ſecond Article has theſe words, <hi>That there was held heretofore a Council in</hi> Armenia, <hi>wherein aſſiſted the Catholick, that is to ſay, the Patriarch of the</hi> Armenians, <hi>with their Biſhops, Doctors, and the Patriarch of the</hi> Suriens. <note place="margin">Raynald. ad an. 1341.</note> 
                           <hi>That in this Council was rejected the Council of</hi> Chalcedon, <hi>eſpecially becauſe it had determined we muſt believe there are two Natures in Jeſus Chriſt; to wit the Humane and the Divine, and one only Perſon ſubſiſting in two Natures. That the Council of the</hi> Armenians <hi>had on their ſide determined, that as in our Saviour Chriſt there is but one only Perſon, ſo likewiſe is there in him but one Nature, to wit the Divine, one only Will, and one Operation; that they anathematiſed thoſe that affirmed the contrary, and perſecuted them not only by impriſonments, and loading them with Chains, but even to the putting them to death. That in this Council they had condemned Pope</hi> Leo <hi>and his</hi>

That in fine they Canonized</hi> Dioſcorus <hi>whom the Council of</hi> Chalcedon <hi>had condemned, and the</hi> Armenians <hi>celebrated his Feſtival three times in a year as a Saint; and curſed</hi> Leo <hi>and the Council of</hi> Chalcedon <hi>which had condemned</hi> Dioſcorus. The twentieth Article bears, <hi>That the</hi> Armenians <hi>believe and hold, that the Eternal Son of God begotten of the Subſtance of the Father, has united to himſelf the Humane Nature, and was made man, yet in ſuch a manner that, in the Union, the Humane Nature was converted into the Divine Nature; and as there was after the Union but one Perſon in Jeſus Chriſt, ſo is there but one Nature in it, to wit the Divine and not the Humane, That they curſe all thoſe who ſay the contrary; ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deteſting thoſe that hold the two Natures in Jeſus Chriſt after the Union, to wit, the Divine and humane, that if any Baptiſed</hi> Armenian <hi>amongſt them ſayd this, they would not communicate with him; but eſteem him as a Heathen; and upon his Return to the faith of the</hi> Armenians, <hi>rebaptiſe him neither more nor leſs then if he came from Paganiſm; and after this ſecond Baptiſm lay twenty years Pennance on him.</hi> And in the twenty firſt Article. <hi>The</hi> Armenians <hi>believe and hold that becauſe after the Union of Natures in Jeſus Chriſt, the Humane Nature was converted into the Divine, in ſuch a manner that from that very moment there was only the Divine Nature in him,) the Divinity has been paſſible and impaſſible, mortal and immortal, according as our Saviour himſelf pleaſed, and that thus he has ſuffered and is dead in the Divine Nature becauſe he would, having no humane Nature when he ſuffered and dyed.</hi> Do's Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> imagine we ſhall reſt contented when he ſhall tell us, that all theſe things are meer impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures?</p>

But how can this be if they condemn <hi>Eutyches</hi> and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41961:208"/> 
                           <hi>Dioſcorus,</hi> and affirm not the Humane Nature was confounded and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the Divine: if they grant the Humane Nature as well as the Catholicks, and their Error conſiſts only in refuſing to uſe the expreſſion of the two Natures, as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> aſſures us.</p>
                        <p>BUT after all theſe Teſtimonys I think I may re-ſtabliſh the Authority of <hi>Euthymius Zigabenus</hi> the <hi>Greek Monk,</hi> and that of <hi>Iſaac</hi> an <hi>Armenian</hi> Catholick, who have both of 'em Written againſt the <hi>Schiſmatical Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> and ſay the ſame thing as the reſt. Mr <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſays, they prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and impoſe on their Readers, but what I now come from relating ſufficiently juſtifies them from this Accuſation. <hi>After the Councel of Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> ſays Euthymius, <hi>the Armenians at the Inſtigation of one Hilarius Mandacanus, and other Prophane Prieſts that were with him, ſeparated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi>

                           <hi>from the Catholick Church: and having embraced the impious Opinion of Eutyches, Dioſcorus and other Monophyſical Hereticks that hold only one Nature in our Saviour Chriſt, they added thereunto ſeveral other impious Doctrines, to make their Hereſie as it were more Compleat and Famous. For they ſay our Saviour Chriſt took on him a Body which was not of the ſame ſubſtance as ours, that his is Incorruptible, Impaſſible, Subtil, Uncreated, and Heavenly, which ſeemed to exerciſe the Humane functions, as to See, Eat, and Drink, and yet did none of all theſe things. They ſay moreover that the Fleſh of Chriſt was changed into the Divinity, and made of the ſame Eſſence with the Divinity it ſelf. That as a Drop of Honey or Vinegar caſt into the Sea is not ſeen, do's no longer ſubſiſt; ſo the Body of Chriſt being ingulphed and ſwallowed up in the Ocean of the Divinity, keeps no longer its own Nature and propriety; and thus there are not two Natures in Chriſt, but one alone, which is wholly Divine. And there fore they deny the Sacrifice of Bread, which is the fleſh of Chriſt, to be the Body of Chriſt, but call it the Body of the Divinity. That when they are convinced and constrained by ſtrength of Argument, to acknowledge our Saviour Chriſt to be both God and Man, they do it by diſſimulation, for how can they ſeriouſly acknowledge him to be Man, ſeeing as I already mentioned they affirm his ſubſtance to be different from ours. They change,</hi> ſays Iſaac, <hi>the traditions of the Catholick Church, and the mysteries of Chriſt according to their blaſphemous fancy; they do not call the Communion, or the Sacrifice of Bread which is the fleſh of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Body of Chriſt as he himſelf has called it, but the Divinity.</hi>

                        <p>MR. Arnaud may ſay as long as he pleaſes <hi>that theſe two Authors miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Armenians in charging them with believing the Humane Nature to</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 5. C. 6. P. 3. 455.</note> 
                           <hi>have been ingulphed by the Divine, and to be pure Eutychiens.</hi> What reaſon has he to think the World will be ſatisfied with this anſwer, as if it were ſufficient for the rejecting of Authors to bring againſt them bold accuſations, without any ground or proof; and humorouſly maintain that what they affirm is falſe?</p>
                        <p>BREEREWOOD, ſays he, <hi>and other modern Authors ſay as much.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ibid.</hi> P. 456. <hi>Breerewoods.</hi> inquirys. C. 24.</note> As to <hi>Breerewood</hi> tis true he ſays, <hi>that it ſeems by their confeſſion touching the Trinity, ſent by the Mandate of the Catholick of Armenia to the Patriarck of Armenia about fifty years ſince, that they have wholly renounced this Fancy.</hi> But this confeſſion on which <hi>Breerewood</hi> grounds his ſuppoſal is at moſt only the private ſentiment of this Catholick of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and not that of this Church. If <hi>Breerewood</hi> adds any thing of his own Head, without any Proof, his bare word is not to be preferred before the Teſtimony of other Authors, whom we have already alledged: that which we have
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41961:209"/> ſeen of <hi>Cyril,</hi> and his diſpute againſt <hi>Barſabas</hi> in the preſence of all the People, and in the very Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is later than the confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he mentions. And ſo is that alſo which <hi>Cottovic</hi> relates. The Letter of <hi>Barbereau</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> bears Date 1667. The Relation of the Biſhop of <hi>Heliopolis</hi> which ſays (as we have already ſeen,) <hi>That the Patriarch of the Armenians to whom he gave a viſit reſided near the City of Herivan, in a famous Monaſtery of Eutychien Hereticks who are no leſs obſtinate than ignorant, and being deſirous to confer with one of theſe Monks on the principal Point of the Hereſie of Eutyches, he cunningly ſhunned the occaſion.</hi> This Relation I ſay is Dated 1668. All theſe Teſtimonys ſhew us, that the Armenians do ſtill keep their Ancient error, and have in no wiſe changed their belief.</p>
                        <p>BUT ſuppoſing they were changed within theſe fifty or ſixty years as <hi>Breerewood</hi> imagins, yet would what <hi>Euthymius, Iſaac,</hi> and other Authors ſay be no leſs true, on the contrary the change which <hi>Breerewood</hi> attributes to them would only more Authorize their Teſtimony. For if it be true as <hi>Breere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> ſays, <hi>that they have now renounced that Fancy,</hi> they had it then here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, for People are not wont to renounce thoſe Opinions which they never held: ſo that the Argument drawn from their Doctrine touching the unity of the Nature of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to ſhew they do not believe Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation do's ſtill continue in full force as to the time paſt; and all that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> can conclude hence, is, that it is poſſible for the Body of a Church to change an Opinion and paſs over to another which is quite Oppoſite, without any noiſe or diſturbance; whence it follows that the pretenſions of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> touching the impoſſibility of a change are vain and groundleſs. As to thoſe other late Authors Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſpeaks of, when he pleaſes to give us a particular Account of them we will examine 'em, but there's no body but ſees, after what I have related, that he ought not to ſpeak ſo generally as he has done, <hi>That other Modern Authors are agreed therein,</hi> ſeeing, <hi>John Cottovic, Pietro Della Vallé, Cyrillus, Thomas a Jeſu, Barbereau,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Heliopolis,</hi> are late Authors, and yet aſſert the contrary of what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> affirms.</p>
                        <p>NEITHER can Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> meliorate his cauſe by the Letter which was written by a Patriarch of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and ſent to the Emperour <hi>Emanuel;</hi> nor by the conference which <hi>Theorien</hi> this Emperour's Deputy had with this Patriarch; altho it were true that this Letter has theſe Expreſſions, <hi>we hold there is but one Nature in Jeſus Chriſt, not in confounding it, as</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Theorien.</hi> Dial. adverſ. Arm. Bibl. Patr. Graeco. lat. tom. 1.</note> 
                           <hi>Eutyches does; nor in denying Chriſts humane Nature like</hi> Apollinairus, <hi>but according to</hi> Cyrillus <hi>Patriarch of</hi> Alexandria <hi>in the Books he wrote againſt</hi> Neſtorius, <hi>in ſaying there was but one Nature of the Word which is Incarnate.</hi> But we muſt not immediately Imagine that this was the ſentiment of the <hi>Armenian</hi> Church. It was the Patriarchs in particular, as appears by the Dialogue of <hi>Theorien.</hi> For after <hi>Theorien</hi> had for a long time diſputed that, our Saviour had two Natures, two Wills, and two Operations; the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch himſelf confeſſed this had been ever his Opinion ſince he read the ſacred Writings. Whereupon <hi>Theorien</hi> having demanded of him why he inſerted in his Letter to the Emperour, that there was but one only Nature in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> The Patriarch anſwered, that he had at that time in his thoughts the inſtance which is commonly made uſe of touching man who is made up of Body and Soul, and yet is ſaid to have but one Nature, altho the two Natures of which he conſiſts remain without confuſion, and change; and that he believed St. <hi>Cyril</hi> meant the ſame. In fine he told him he
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41961:209"/> would ſhew him a ſecret which had not yet been Divulged amongſt his People? That there was a Patriarch of <hi>Armenia</hi> named <hi>John,</hi> who was a bitter Enemy to the <hi>Monophyſits;</hi> which is to ſay, to thoſe that believe only one Nature in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and that he had the writings of this <hi>John,</hi> together with the approbation of another of his Predeceſſors named <hi>Gregory;</hi> who added thereunto theſe words, <hi>I believe likewiſe what the holy Patriarch has here written, and Anathematiſe thoſe that do not believe it.</hi> It is evident by all theſe circumſtances that the belief of the two Natures in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> thus united to make thereof but one, was not the publick ſentiment of the <hi>Armenian</hi> Church, but the private Opinion of the Patriarch, who diſputed with <hi>Theorien,</hi> and that he had taken this Opinion from the ſecret writings of this <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Gregory.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT it will be perhaps here demanded, how this perſon could in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience continue a Patriarch in the <hi>Armenian</hi> Church being of a contrary judgment. To anſwer this Objection, I need only give the Character of this perſon, ſuch as it appears to be in this ſame conference, and this will more confirm the truth of what I now ſaid. <hi>This,</hi> ſays he, <hi>do I intend to do, I will immediately write to all the</hi> Armenian <hi>Biſhops whitherſoever they be to aſſemble in Council. And when met, I will produce all the Arguments alledged by the</hi> Armenians, <hi>and which in effect do ſeem to favour them. Then will I propoſe on the other hand all the contrary proofs which you have now offered me, and at first will take the</hi> Armenians <hi>part, and diſpute against you. But inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly and by degrees, and with great caution, will begin to diſcover the Error of the</hi> Armenians, <hi>which has hitherto ſo greatly obtained amongſt them. I will convince them by</hi> John <hi>the Patriarchs Book, and all the other Proofs you have furniſhed me with. In fine, I will declare my ſelf openly for the Greeks (or to ſpeak better) I will contend for the truth againſt the</hi> Armenians. <hi>I hope by Gods aſſiſtance my ſheep will hear my voice and follow me, ſo that there will be but one Flock and one Shepherd. If all the Biſhops ſhall be for me, nothing will be more welcome to me: But if not, I will notwithſtanding confirm the true Doctrine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with thoſe on my ſide; and ſend to the Emperour and your Patriarch a writing under my Hand and Seal and ſigned by my Biſhops, containing the Orthodox Faith. Now this writing ſhall contain amongſt other Articles this ſame, That we receive the Holy, and univerſal Council of Chalcedon, and all the Holy Fathers which that Council has receiv'd. That we Anathematiſe all thoſe Anathematiſed by that Council; eſpcially,</hi> Eutyches <hi>and</hi> Dioſcorus, <hi>and</hi> Severus, <hi>and</hi> Timotheus Aylu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, <hi>and in general all thoſe that have oppoſed this Council.</hi> This Diſcourſe plainly ſhews that this good Patriarch was a little <hi>Jeſuitical,</hi> and did not make it a caſe of Conſcience to Act a Deceitful part in his Council; much leſs in his Church. But 'tis likewiſe Eaſy to gather hence that the ſentiment which he in the beginning propoſed in his Letter to the Emperour, and which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned all this intrigue was not that of his Church, but his own particular, for had the difference between the <hi>Armenians</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> conſiſted only in the uſe of ſome terms as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> tells us it did, there would have been no need of Stratagem to effect this deſign. It would have been ſufficient to ſhew plainly that it was but an Equivocation, a miſ-underſtanding, or at moſt but a queſtion concerning words, which muſt not hinder the effects of Chriſtian Charity. Neither was there any Neceſſity of promiſing the Emperours Deputy that there ſhould be inſerted in this new confeſſion of Faith an expreſs Article containing the Condemnation of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> and <hi>Dioſcorus,</hi> if in effect the <hi>Armenians</hi> followed not their Opinions.</p>

                        <p>IT appears then from what I have ſaid, that <hi>Eutymius</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Impoſtors, nor Calumniators when they attributed to the <hi>Armenians</hi> the Hereſie of <hi>Eutyches;</hi> and ſaid their belief was that our Saviour <hi>Chriſt</hi> had no real Humane Nature; but that his Humanity was ſwallowed up or changed into the Divine Nature. After the depoſition of thoſe Authors I mentioned, there can be no reaſon for the calling in queſtion a thing ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: now it hence manifeſtly follows that the <hi>Armenians</hi> cannot hold the Tranſubſtantiation of the <hi>Latins,</hi> that is to ſay, the converſion of Bread into the ſubſtance of the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſeeing they hold our Saviour has no longer a Body; and all Mr. <hi>Arnauds</hi> exceptions are vain and to no purpoſe.</p>

                           <hi>Twenty ſecond Error,</hi> ſays he, <hi>of the</hi> Armenians <hi>conſiſts in their not believing that after the conſecration is performed by the words of our Saviour Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced on the Bread, and Wine, the Body of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>is truly, and really contained under the ſpecies of Bread and Wine, but they hold they are only ſo by reſemblance and figure, ſaying that our Saviour Chriſt did not</hi> Tranſubſtantiate <hi>the Bread and Wine into his real Body and Blood, but eſtabliſhed them only as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance and figure.</hi> And in another place Arguing againſt their Opinion, <hi>The Armenians,</hi> ſays he, <hi>have no Salvo for the truth of theſe words which they themſelves utter in the Canon of their Maſs, to wit, and that they may be made the real Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. They thus expound them, the true Body, that is to ſay, the true reſemblance of the Body, but this expoſition will not paſs, becauſe the true reſemblance of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is not the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt, as the Image of a Man is not a real Man. Man is the true Image and reſemblance of God, but he is not true God by Nature; if then this be only the reſemblance, and not the truth, or the true Body of Chriſt as the</hi> Armenians <hi>falſly ſay, it cannot be called the true Body.</hi> The Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> reject this teſtimony, ask e'm why, they can give you no other reaſon but this, That they believe <hi>Guy Carmes</hi> was miſtaken. 'Tis indeed my Opinion that we muſt not decide queſtions of this importance by the Teſtimony of ſome particular Perſons who may deceive others or be deceiv'd themſelves. But as to <hi>Guy Carmes</hi> what likelyhood is there that a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41961:210"/> Religious, who was all his life time devoted to the intereſts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and often employed by the Pope upon ſeveral Occaſions, as a moſt truſty Servant, and moreover a Perſon of good parts and conſiderable Learning in thoſe Days, being Prior General alſo of his order, Inquiſitor General of the faith, and Biſhop of <hi>Majorca</hi> in the <hi>Balearian</hi> Iſles, and wrote of the <hi>Armenians</hi> in a Book which he made concerning Hereſies, what likelyhood is there he ſhould write a thing ſo poſitively and clearly that the <hi>Armenians</hi> deny the real preſence, were he not well aſſured of it? What advantage could he expect by imputing falſly to a whole Church an Opinion which he himſelf held to be a Damnable Error, and that at the ſame time wherein the <hi>Romans</hi> that perſecuted in the Weſt thoſe who were in this point of the ſame judgment, and why would he give this advantage againſt Truth to thoſe deem'd Hereticks? It is moreover to be obſerv'd that <hi>Guy Carmes</hi> flouriſhed under the Popedom of <hi>John</hi> 22, that is to ſay, in an Age wherein all the Eaſt was overſpread with Emiſſarys, and eſpecially <hi>Armenia</hi>

                        <p>THE Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> to get clear from this Teſtimony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought <note place="margin">Perp. <hi>of the faith part. 3.

I confeſs this acknowledgment of Mr. <hi>Arnauds</hi> is praiſe-worthy, but this confident Aſſertion of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> is not ſo, for altho a retractation is a vertuous effect, yet methinks a man ought to be ſparing in this particular. But to go on with our Proofs.</p>
                        <p>THE Second ſhall be taken from the Teſtimony of Pope <hi>John</hi> 22. The Hiſtorian <hi>Raynaldus</hi> relates that in his time not only the <hi>Armenians</hi> which dwelt in <hi>Cilicia</hi> and <hi>Armenia</hi> embraced the Doctrines of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but thoſe alſo that were driven out by the <hi>Saracens</hi> and were withdrawn into <hi>Cherſonneſus Taurique</hi> ſubmitted themſelves to the Biſhop of <hi>Capha</hi> who was a <hi>Latin.</hi> That he received them in the name of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. That the Pope thereupon congratulated them, <hi>and ſhewed them that in the Divine Myſteries the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine were changed into the Body and Blood</hi>
                           <pb n="28" facs="tcp:41961:211"/> 
                           <hi>of Jeſus Chriſt, and that there ought to be mingled ſome Water with the Wine before it be conſecrated.</hi> He afterwards produces this Popes Letter to the Arch-Biſhop and <hi>Armenian</hi> Prieſts which were in the Dioceſs of <hi>Capha. We have receiv'd,</hi> ſays Pope John, <hi>great ſatisfaction in Underſtanding how the Almighty Creator diſplaying his virtue in you has enlightned your minds with the Knowledge of his ſaving Grace, and in that you have vowed to keep the Catholick faith which the Holy</hi> Roman <hi>Church truly holds, which ſhe faithfully Teaches and Preaches, and that you have promiſed Obedience to the</hi> Roman <hi>Prelate and his Church, in the preſence of our Reverend Brother</hi> Jerome <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Capha. <hi>And therefore we earnestly deſire that holding the ſaving Doctrines of this Church you likewiſe obſerve its Ceremonies, eſpecially in what relates to the moſt excellent of the Sacraments, which is the ineffable Sacrament of the Altar. For altho all the other Sacraments confer ſanctifying Grace, yet in this is contained intirely Jeſus Chriſt Sacramentally under the ſpecies of Bread and Wine, which remain, the Bread being</hi> Tranſubſtantiated <hi>into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt and the Wine into his Blood.</hi> Then he tells them they muſt mingle water with the wine in the Chalice, becauſe this mixture is a Commemoration of our Lords Death, and of the Blood and Water which guſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out from his ſide. 'Tis evident that this Pope applyes himſelf only to theſe two Articles, becauſe the <hi>Armenians</hi> held neither of them, and that in reference to them it was a new Doctrine and Ceremony in which they had need to be inſtructed. For to what purpoſe ſhould <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> be recommended to them if they before held it for a fundamental point of their Ancient Religion? Why muſt all the other points of Controverſy between the two Churches be laid aſide, as that of the Proceſſion of the Holy Spirit, the two Natures of our Saviour Chriſt, Purgatory, Confirmation, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others to ſtick wholly to <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and the mixture of Water? The thing declares it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> who is of all men in the World the moſt ready at proofs, makes one of this. <hi>The Pope,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſo little diſtruſted the</hi> Armenians <hi>believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not</hi> Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>that altho he propoſes it to them expreſly, yet he</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 5. Ch. 6. p. 469.</note> 
                           <hi>does it only occaſionally, and by way of principle, to aſſert the Wine ought to be mixt with Water. And this last particular is that to which he particularly applys himſelf, and which is the Capital or Summary of his Letter; whereas had he had the least thought that the</hi> Armenians <hi>believed not</hi> Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>he would without doubt have ſet about proving it, and that with more care and earneſtneſs than he does the mixture of Water in the Chalice.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> muſt pardon me if I tell him, 'tis not true that the Pope does only occaſionally mention <hi>Tranſubstantiation</hi> and by way of principle to eſtabliſh the mixture of Water. <hi>Raynaldus</hi> who relates this affair gives a better account of it than he, <hi>ipſos inſtruxit,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ut in divinis myſteriis ſubſtantia panis et vini integris ſpeciebus, cum Chriſti corpore et ſanguine commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taretur, et vino conſecrando aqua modica affundenda eſſet.</hi> I believe I do not do ill in oppoſing againſt Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Illuſion, a truth atteſted by an Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian that faithfully relates the matter, without the leaſt regard to our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. Moreover what can be more unreaſonable than to ſay as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> do's that the Pope propoſes <hi>Tranſubſtantiation only occaſionally and by way of Principle to eſtabliſh thereby the putting of Water into the Cup</hi>? What Relation is there between theſe two things, it do's not follow from the believing of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> that Water muſt be put in the Chalice, nor that thoſe which do not do it oppoſe this Doctrine. Theſe are two diſtinct points
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41961:211"/> which have their Proofs apart without any Coherence or mutual depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and there cannot be perhaps any thing imputed to a Pope leſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming the Dignity and Infallibility of the Head of the Church than to make him argue after this manner. <hi>The Bread and Wine are</hi> Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated, <hi>therefore you muſt put Water into the Chalice.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ought to be more careful of the Honour of this Prelate, and obſerve that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and the mixture of Water are not in his Diſcourſe <hi>a kind of Principle and Concluſion,</hi> (this would be Ridiculous) but a Doctrine, and Practice which the Pope recommends to the <hi>Armenians,</hi> to the end they may be henceforward conformable to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in the ſubject of the Sacrament of the Altar, and thus <hi>Raynaldus</hi> underſtood it, who has been more ſincere in this than Mr. <hi>Arnaud.</hi> As to that minute obſervation that the Pope do's more inſiſt on the mixture of Water than on <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> it is not worthconſidering for this proceeds not from the cauſe Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins, but only from the Popes declaring to the <hi>Armenians</hi> the myſtical ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this mixture, which required ſome Diſcourſe, and which <hi>Raynaldus</hi> has well obſerved, whodiſtinguiſhestheſethree particulars in the Popes Letter, Tranſubſtantiation, the Mixture of Water, and the myſtical ſignifications. <hi>Ipſos inſtruxit ut indivinis myſteriis ſubſtantia panis &amp; vini integris ſpeciebus, cum Chriſti corpore &amp; ſanguine commutaretur, &amp; vino conſecrando aqua modica affun denda eſſet, acdivina ea re adumbratra myſteria aperuit,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>he taught 'em the Doctrine of</hi> Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>the mixture of Water, and ſhewed them the myſteries repreſented by this mixture.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>MY third Proof is taken from the information which <hi>Benedict</hi> XII Succeſſor to <hi>John</hi> the XXII cauſed to be made touching the Errours of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> not at <hi>Rome</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has aſſerted through a miſtake, of which inadvertency were I guilty how ſevere would he be upon me?) but at <hi>Avignon,</hi> where he kept his ſeat, and whence his Bull is dated. The 67 Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <note place="margin">Raynauld. <hi>ad Ann.</hi> 1341.</note> is expreſt in theſe Terms, <hi>The</hi> Armenians <hi>do not ſay that after the words of Conſecration, the Bread and Wine are</hi> Tranſubſtantiated <hi>into the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt Born of the Virgin who ſuffered and roſe again. But they hold that this Sacrament is a repreſentation, a reſemblance or a figure of the true Body and Blood of our Lord. And this ſome of the</hi> Armenian <hi>Doctors have particularly aſſerted, to wit, that the real Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt are not in the Eucharist, but that it is a repreſentation, and a reſemblance of them. They ſay likewiſe that when our Saviour inſtituted this Sacrament, he did not</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiate <hi>the Bread and Wine into his Body, but only inſtituted a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or a reſemblance of his Body and Blood, and therefore they do not call the Sacrament of the Altar, the Body and Blood of our Lord, but the Hoſt, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, or the Communion. One of their Doctors called</hi> Darces <hi>has written that when the Prieſt ſays theſe words, this is my Body, then the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is Dead, but when he adds, by which Holy Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is alive; yet has he not expreſſed whether it be the true Body or the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of it. The</hi> Armenians <hi>likewiſe ſay we muſt expound that which is ſay'd in the Cannon of their Maſs, by which Holy Spirit the Bread is made the real Body of Jeſus Chriſt in this ſence, that by the real Body of Jeſus Chriſt, we muſt underſtand the real reſemblance or repreſentation of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. And therefore</hi> Damaſcen <hi>cenſuring them for this ſays that the</hi> Armenians <hi>have this Two Hundred years aboliſhed all the Sacraments, and that their Sacraments were not given them by the Apoſtles, nor</hi> Greek <hi>or</hi> Latin <hi>Church, but that they had taken them up according to their own Fancy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>MR <hi>Arnaud</hi> who in looking over his <hi>Raynaldus</hi> has met with this clear Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

He tells us that after an exact ſearch into the cauſe which might move <hi>Guy Carmes</hi> to impute this Error to the <hi>Armenians</hi> he at length found it in this information which Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> the XII ordered to be drawn up.

There is great likelyhood that <hi>Guy Carmes</hi> made not this information his rule, for beſides that he ſay's nothing of it, he reckons up but Thirty Errours of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> whereas the information computes 'em to be about One Hundred and Seventeen. But ſuppoſing it were ſo, all that can be concluded thence is, that in the Fourteenth Century the truth of the things contained in this act was not queſtioned, but paſt for ſuch certainties that the Writers of thoſe times ſcrupled not to make them the Subject of their Books.

And this diſtinction is exactly obſerved in the Articles themſelves, in which the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Opinions are Deſcribed in theſe terms, <hi>quidam,</hi> or <hi>aliqui tenent,</hi> as in Article CVI. <hi>Quidam Catholicon</hi> Armenorum <hi>dixit &amp; ſcripſit, quod in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerali Reſurrectione omnes homines conſurgent cum Corporibus ſuis, ſed tamen in Corporibus eorum non erit Sexuum diſcretio.</hi> And in the CVIII Article, <hi>Aliqui magni Homines</hi> Armeni Laici <hi>dixerunt quod ſicut beſtiae in morte expirant, &amp; ſic moriuntur, ita &amp; Homines; &amp; ſicut beſtiae cum ſemel morte fuerunt, nunquam reſurgent, ita nec homines. The Opinions held only in one</hi> Armenia <hi>are likewiſe denoted exactly in theſe Words. In majori</hi> Armenia, <hi>In minori</hi> Armenia, <hi>or, Catholicon majoris</hi> Armeniae, <hi>Catholicon minoris</hi> Armeniae. The common Opinions are expreſſed in theſe Terms, Armeni <hi>dicunt,</hi> Armeni <hi>tenent.</hi> And altho in the Article which reſpects the real Preſence and <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> we find theſe words. <hi>Et hoc ſpecialiter aliqui magiſtri</hi> Armenorum <hi>dixerunt, videlicet quod non erat ibi Corpus Chriſti verum &amp; Sanguis, ſed exemplar, &amp; ſimilitudo ejus;</hi> yet is this ſame ſentiment imputed generally to all the <hi>Armenians,</hi> for the Article begins thus, <hi>Item quod</hi> Armeni, <hi>non dicunt quod poſt verba conſecrationis Panis &amp; Vini ſit facta Tranſubstantiatio Panis &amp; Vini in verum Corpus Chriſti &amp; San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinem.</hi> And towards the end of the ſame Article there is, <hi>Quod etiam</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meni <hi>illud quod ponitur in eorum Canone Miſſae, per quem panis Benedictus efficitur verum Corpus Christi, exponunt quia efficitur ibi vera ſimilitudo, &amp; exemplar Corporis &amp; Sanguinis Chriſti. Unde</hi> Damaſcenus <hi>propter hoc reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens eos dixit, quod ducenti tunc anni erant quod</hi> Armeni <hi>perdiderunt omnia Sacramenta,</hi> &amp;c. It is then clear that this information attributes this Opinion not to ſome particular Perſons, but to the whole Body of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> ſeeing that on one hand this Article bears the Character of Errors, common to the <hi>Armenians;</hi> and on the other there is applyed to 'em what <hi>Damaſcene</hi> ſay'd of 'um ſo long before, <hi>that they had loſt all the Sacraments.</hi> Let Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> beſtir himſelf as fiercely as he pleaſes, he cannot hinder us from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that if this Article related only to Particular Perſons; witneſſes of the Fourteenth Century, that depoſe what it contains would never have ſought in the eight Century, that is to ſay, Six Hundred Years before the Authority of <hi>Damaſcen</hi> to confirm what they depoſed, and even to confirm it by a paſſage which reſpects the Church of the <hi>Armenians</hi> in general, and which accuſes it for having no true Sacrament.</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> obſerves afterwards that in this ſame Article there is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed another <hi>Armenian</hi> Doctor named <hi>Narces,</hi> for ſaying when the Prieſt <note place="margin">C. 9. P. 48.</note> pronounces theſe Words, <hi>Hoc eſt Corpus meum,</hi> the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is then in a ſtate of Death, and when he adds, <hi>perquem,</hi> the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is then alive. <hi>It is true,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the information adds that this Doctor do's not expreſs whether he ſpeaks of the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt, or of the Figure.</hi>
                           <pb n="32" facs="tcp:41961:213"/> 
                           <hi>But the difference of theſe two ſtates of Life and Death being to be found in a figure which does not change, ſufficiently ſhews that he ſpake of the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> If theſe two ſtates of Life and Death cannot be found in a figure, much leſs in the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt, which is no more Subject to Death, nor the Neceſſity of riſing again. Is Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſo greatly prejudic'd that he cannot perceive the ſence of this Doctor is, that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is a myſtery which expreſſes the whole oeconomy of Jeſus Chriſt, eſpecially his Death, and Reſurrection, according to the common Doctrine of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> from which in this reſpect the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not vary?</p>
                        <p>IN the Seventyeth Error, ſays he moreover, <hi>the ſame</hi> Armenians <hi>are</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid</note> 
                           <hi>charged with believing that when any one receives the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>the Body of Jeſus Chriſt Deſcends into his Body, and is converted therein as other aliments, which is a contrary Hereſie to that of</hi> Berengarius. But as <hi>Berengarius</hi> would not have ſcrupled to call the Bread, which is the Sacrament of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; ſo neither would he have ſcrupled to expreſs himſelf in the ſame manner, as this Article makes the <hi>Armenians</hi> do, <hi>That the Body of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that is to ſay, the Bread which is the figure of it, <hi>Deſcends into our Bodies, and is changed into our Bodies.</hi> So that this contrariety which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> imagins, has no Ground. But there is a real Oppoſition between this Diſcourſe of the <hi>Armenians</hi> that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is Changed into our Bodies as other food, and the Opinion of <hi>Tranſubstantiation;</hi> for how can it be conceived that the proper ſubſtance of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt which is in Heaven ſhould be changed into our Bodies, that an incorruptible ſubſtance ſhould be digeſted, and changed, that a ſubſtance which exiſts after the manner of Spirits, ſhould nouriſh us and become food to us? It appears then from this very thing that by the Body of Jeſus Chriſt the <hi>Armenians</hi> mean only the Sacrament or Myſtery of this Body, which in reſpect of its ſubſtance is real Bread.</p>
                        <p>NEITHER is it to any purpoſe to Remark, as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> do's, <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that thoſe to whom was attributed the believing the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to be only the figure of Chriſts Body were not wont to call the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and yet commonly the <hi>Armenians</hi> do thus call it, as appears by their Liturgies. For 'tis evident the ſence of this Article is, not that abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely the <hi>Armenians</hi> rejected this expreſſion, ſeeing it immediately after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards attributes it to them; but that it was not uſual amongſt them, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince they ſaw the <hi>Latins</hi> abuſed it, and therefore they choſe rather to uſe thoſe of Hoſt, Sacrifice and Communion.</p>
                        <p>IT is alſo to no purpoſe to ſay the Liturgy of the <hi>Armenians</hi> is contrary <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> to this Opinion, ſeeing it contained the Bread is made the real Body of Jeſus Chriſt; for they expounded it in this ſence, that the Bread is made the true reſemblance, or the repreſentation of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>This explication,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud, is ſo abſurd and ridiculous, that it could not be very common, it being impoſſible the generality ſhould entertain it.</hi> But does Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> believe that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> being fully and truly explained, as it is in it ſelf, and conſequences and dependencies, can be more eaſily entertain'd by a People than this ſence which the <hi>Armenians</hi> give to the terms of their Liturgy?</p>
                        <p>AS to what he adds, <hi>that it is ſay'd,</hi> in the Seventyeth Article, <hi>that</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>

                           <hi>according to the</hi> Armenians <hi>the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>do's not effect the remiſſion of Sins, nor confer Grace, and that this is contrary to the Words of the Liturgy of the</hi> Armenians <hi>of</hi> Leopolis, <hi>and a paſſage of the Catholick of</hi> Armenia <hi>in the conference of</hi> Theorien, <hi>which ſay's they Sacrifice in the Church the ſon of God for the Salvation of the whole World.</hi> All that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> can conclude hence is, That the <hi>Armenians</hi> reſiding in <hi>Armenia</hi> do not well agree in this point with thoſe of <hi>Leopolis</hi> in <hi>Poland,</hi> and that the Catholick which conferred with <hi>Theorien</hi> was of no great conſideration amongſt them; but it cannot hence follow that the things which theſe Articles contain are only the Opinions of ſome particular Perſons.</p>
                        <p>BUT, ſays moreover Mr. <hi>Arnaud, the</hi> Armenians <hi>juſtified themſelves</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                           <hi>by acts, decrees, and formal declarations; the King of</hi> Armenia, <hi>cauſed a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious named</hi> Daniel <hi>to draw up a Memorial, in which he proteſted againſt theſe Errors, and complains they were unjuſtly charged on his Nation. The Patriarch and Biſhops being aſſembled condemned them. The Patriarch of the leſſer</hi> Armenia <hi>declared to</hi> Clement <hi>the Sixth his faith touching the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>in theſe terms; That the Body of Jeſus Chriſt born of the Virgin, Dead on the Croſs, and which is now alive in Heaven after the Words of the Conſecration of the Bread which are, This is my Body, is in the Sacrament of the Altar under the ſpecies and appearances of Bread.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THERE is a ſtrange Illuſion in all this Diſcourſe. 'Tis true the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> who needed the Popes protection drew up this Memorial men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by Mr. <hi>Arnaud.</hi> But ſeeing he had this Remark from <hi>Raynaldus</hi> he ought not to have ſuppreſſed what the ſame <hi>Raynaldus</hi> adds, <hi>Caeterum non</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Raynald. ubi ſupra.</note> 
                           <hi>falſo ſubornata erant haec crimina in</hi> Armenos, <hi>nec temerè credita à</hi> Benedicto, <hi>faſſosenim</hi> Clementi <hi>VI.</hi> Armeniae <hi>Regis Oratoresplures errores in</hi> Armenia <hi>pullu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſe, &amp;</hi> Clementem <hi>ſtudia ſua ut abolerentur applicuiſſe viſuriſumus. Moreoverthe</hi> Armenians <hi>were not falſly accuſed of theſe crimes, nor did</hi> Benedict <hi>believe them without ſufficient grounds. For the Ambaſſadors of the King of</hi> Armenia <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to</hi> Clement <hi>the Sixth, that ſeveral Errors had ſprung up in</hi> Armenia, <hi>and</hi> Clement <hi>uſed his utmoſt endeavours to cruſh them, as we ſhall ſee by what follows.</hi> This diſ-acknowledgment then of the King, and complaint which <hi>Daniel</hi> made concerning the imputation of Doctrines to the <hi>Armenians</hi> which they never own'd, was only a Politick intrigue, which yet does not hinder the information of <hi>Benedict</hi> from being true. I do not doubt but the King in the extremity of his affairs, threatned by the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and having no hope but in the protection of the <hi>Latins,</hi> aſſembled his Biſhops that they might ſatisfie the Pope in what he deſired, and condemn the Errors contained in his Bull. But if Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will conclude, that then they had them not before, <hi>Raynaldus</hi> will draw a contrary Conſequence, that then they had them. For after having ſay'd, as I now recited, that theſe Errors were not falſly charged upon the <hi>Armenians,</hi> he immediately adds as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which confirms his Propoſition. <hi>Quin etiam commoti pontificiis monitis</hi> Armeni <hi>praeſules coacta ſolemni Synodo numeratos ſuperiùs Errores Eccleſiaſtica execratione damnaverunt, ac decreta inſigni ad ſedem Apoſtolicam legatione imperiis ſe pontificiis adhaeſuros profeſſi ſunt. But moreover the</hi> Armenians <hi>moved by the Popes remonſtrances called a Synod, wherein they Condemned with an Anathema the Errors contained in this information, and ſent Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to the Pope to make profeſſion of their Obedience to his Commands.</hi> He proves that the Errors contained in the Popes information were really the <hi>Armenians,</hi> becauſe the Biſhops met together to Condemn them. What a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41961:214"/> great deal of difference there is between a Perſon that is prejudiced and one that is not. <hi>Raynaldus</hi> is naturally no more favourable to us than Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> the one is a Prieſt of the Oratory, and the other a Doctor of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> yet they draw from the ſame matter of fact contrary Concluſions; one hence ſhews the <hi>Armenians</hi> were innocent of the things they were accuſed, and th'other from the ſame Principle proves they were Culpable. And this becauſe one has the diſpute in his Eye, and th'other not, the one Reaſons without paſſion and th'other is in a heat.</p>
                        <p>AS to what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſay's touching the Patriarch of the leſſer <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia</hi> who ſo Authentickly declared his faith concerning the <hi>Eucharist</hi> to Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VI. I cannot but deſire the Readers attention to this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; for here he will perceive one of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s notorious Sophiſms. It is to be obſerved then that after <hi>Benedict</hi> the XII. had ſent into <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia</hi> the Catalogue of this Peoples Errors, the affairs of the <hi>Armenians</hi> growing every day worſe, they reſolved (that they might render the <hi>Latins</hi> favourable to 'em) to make in a Synod a pretended Decree wherein they feigned to renounce theſe Errors, and abjure them; which made Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VI. (who was <hi>Benedict</hi>'s Succeſſor) to ſend them <hi>Anthony</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Gayette,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Piſa,</hi> in quality of Apoſtolical Legats to finiſh (if Poſſible) the Work of their reduction. <hi>Raynaldus</hi> ſpeaks of this act as of a Piece, not by which they cleared themſelves of a falſe accuſation, but whereby they renounced their Opinions, <hi>Poſt habitam,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Synodum at que in ea repudiatos Errores.</hi> And <hi>Clement</hi> ſpeaks after <note place="margin">Raynald. ad ann. 1346. Num. 67. 68. &amp;c.</note> the ſame manner in the Letter he ſent them. <hi>Veſtra Synodo prout per vos commode fieri potuit convocata, Errores abjeciſtis et condemnaſtis prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictos, ſicut in libello quem nobis tranſmiſtſtis continetur.</hi> Obſerve theſe terms <hi>repudiatos Eerores, &amp; Errores abjeciſtis,</hi> for they expreſly ſignifie a change of Opinion, a renunciation of their former Errors, and not a bare Condemnation of Errors for which they had been in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their Church in General impertinently accuſed, as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would make us believe. But the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> urged the Pope to aſſiſt him againſt the Soldan of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who fell upon his Kingdom; and the Pope preſſed him on the other hand, to aſſiſt his Legats in the extirpating of thoſe Errors which were ſo rife in <hi>Armenia.</hi> He wrote alſo to the Legats to inform him of their Succeſs, who gave him to underſtand they loſt their Labour, and that whatſoever declarations the <hi>Armenians</hi> had made, they ſtill perſevered in their Opinions. Which appears by a Letter of <hi>Clement</hi> to the Biſhop of <hi>Nicoſia, ab eorum Erroribus,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>iidem</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Raynald. ad ann. 1310. Num. 37.</note> 
                           <hi>Rex, Catholicus, et Populus minime reſipuiſſe dicuntnr, ſicut per quaſdam litter as miſſas &amp; Scripturam exhibitam nobisluculenter apparet.</hi> They perſevered therein, they repented not of them, ſay's the Pope, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would needs perſwade us they were falſly accuſed.</p>
                        <p>THE Pope had charged his Legat with ſome oppoſite Articles to the Errors of the <hi>Armenians</hi> to make 'um receive them, and that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected the Euchariſt contain'd theſe words, <hi>That the ſame Numerical Body</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Raynaldus ad ann. 1351. Num. 31</note> 
                           <hi>of Jeſus Chriſt, idem numero, which was born of the Virgin and nayled to the Croſs is contain'd in the Eucharist.</hi> One of the Legats, <hi>Anthony</hi> by name, dyed in the way, and <hi>John</hi> having performed his Voyage fail'd not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theſe Articles to the Catholick of <hi>Armenia Minor</hi> and his Biſhops. But the Catholick refuſed to approve them; he abſolutely rejected ſome of them, and made captious and doubtful anſwers to others; he never would admit of the Article touching the Euchariſt which contained, <hi>That after</hi>
                           <pb n="35" facs="tcp:41961:214"/> 
                           <hi>Conſecration it was the ſame Numerical Body of Jeſus Chriſt which was born of a Virgin and ſuffered on the Croſs.</hi> He wrote a Letter in which of fifty three Articles which were offered him he rejected ſixteen of them, amongſt which was that of the Euchariſt; and in the Anſwers he made to the Popes inſtructions, he would never admit of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> but barely ſays, <hi>he believed and held that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt born of the Virgin, dead on the Croſs, and which is now alive in Heaven, after the words of the Conſecration of the Bread which are, this is my Body, is in the Sacrament of the Altar under the ſpecies, and reſemblance of Bread, ſub ſpecie &amp; ſimilitudine panis.</hi> Now 'tis on this whereon Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> grounds himſelf concealing all the reſt of this Hiſtory and producing only theſe laſt words, and drawing from them his Concluſion after his uſual Manner in theſe terms, <hi>I ſee no</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 5: C. 9. pag. 488.</note> 
                           <hi>reaſon to doubt of the faith of this Patriarch conſidering this his declaration,</hi> that is to ſay, it plainly appeared hence that he believed <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and the Subſtantial preſence of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in the Euchariſt.</p>
                        <p>BUT Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is too quick at drawing of Conſequences. For I. he ought not to have diſſembled that in all this affair the queſtion is not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Armenians</hi> held, or did not hold the things contain'd in the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of <hi>Benedict,</hi> but whether they ſincerely renounced them; and whether the act of their renunciation ſent to the Pope was feigned or real. II. He ought not to have diſſembled likewiſe that the whole conduct of the <hi>Amenians</hi> was in this reſpect but a mere cheat, invented only to remedy the diſorders of their State, and procure aſſiſtance from the Weſtern Princes. That the Pope laid hold on this Occaſion to make them receive the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, and they on their ſide endeavoured to deceive the Pope and draw from him what they deſired, in eluding his purſuits. Which is juſtified by the Letter ſent by <hi>Clement</hi> himſelf to the Catholick of <hi>Armenia. Moreover,</hi> ſays he, <hi>we have bin ſeveral times informed by divers</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Raynaldus ibid. Numb 17.</note> 
                           <hi>Perſons worthy of credit, and even by</hi> Armenians, <hi>that you and your Predeceſſors the Catholicks of</hi> Armenia, <hi>and the</hi> Armenians <hi>under your juriſdiction do not in any manner obſerve, what you promiſed us and our Predeceſſors the.</hi> Roman <hi>Prelates touching the Faith. And that which is yet worſe and more deplorable, is, that you have contemned and utterly rejected the wholeſome Inſtructions of our Apoſtolical Legats ſent you in regard to your Souls, but have after a Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner deſpiſed the Faith of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, out of which there is neither Grace nor Salvation.</hi> The ſame thing appears by <hi>Clement</hi>'s Letter to the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> in which having exhorted him earneſtly to endeavour to make his Patriarch receive the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrine <hi>ſincerely and purely</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Raynald. ibid. Numb. 18.</note> 
                           <hi>without duplicity of heart, to the end his Clergy and People may be reunited to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Church,</hi> he adds, <hi>that by this means the mouths of ſeveral Catholicks and</hi> Armenians <hi>too will be ſtopt who ſtick not to affirm, That the Patriarch and other</hi> Armenians <hi>proceeded not in this affair with faithfulneſs and ſimplicity, but with diſſimulation; and that which is yet worſe and more deplorable, they affirm the</hi> Armenians <hi>have turn'd into deriſion and contempt the ſaving Doctrine which the Legats of the Holy See have communicated to them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>III. HE ought not to have conceal'd that the Patriarch of <hi>Armenia,</hi> who would ſave himſelf by ambiguous Anſwers, rejected the Article of the Euchariſt which contain'd, <hi>that it was the ſame Numerical Body which</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Raynald. ibid. Numb. 15.</note> 
                           <hi>was Born of the Virgin and crucified;</hi> and that he neither would admit of the Article of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> becauſe both one and the other ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly contradicted his faith, and left no room for his Equivocations.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41961:215"/> In fine, he ought not to have concluded ſo briskly as he has done from the terms of his Anſwer, that after this declaration, there could be no Reaſon to doubt whether this Patriarch had the ſame faith as the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For notwithſtanding this declaration <hi>Clement</hi> VI. ſtill doubted of it, as alſo the Cardinals, Patriarchs, Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, and Doctors with whom the Pope conſulted about it. Obſerve here the Contents of <note place="margin">Raynaldus ibid. Numb. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>Clement</hi>'s Letter to this Catholick of <hi>Armenia. We have kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd your anſwers, and thoſe of the Church of</hi> Armenia <hi>minor, reduced to certain heads; and having deliberately conſidered them, together with my Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Brethren the Cardinals of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, ſome Patriarchs, Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, and other Prelates, we could not, nor cannot now gather from theſe anſwers, till ſuch time as you give us a more clear Diſcovery, what you and the Church of</hi> Armenia <hi>minor do truely and ſincerely hold and believe.</hi> He afterwards adds this obliged him to make interrogations on Each Article, and deſired plain and direct anſwers. In effect he propoſes 'em to him, and coming to the Article of the Euchariſt having ſet down the firſt anſwer of the Patriarch in the terms I already recited, he adds, <hi>upon this we demand</hi>

                           <hi>Perſon of our Saviour Chriſt do's the ſame. For by the virtue of theſe words the ſubſtance of Bread is changed into his Body, and the ſubſtance of Wine into his Blood, ſo that</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>is intirely contain'd under the ſpecies of Bread, and Wine, and is intire under each part whether of the Conſecrated Hoſt or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Wine, even when the ſpecies are ſeparate.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſay's, <hi>'tis not uſual to propoſe Capital Points of Controverſie in this manner.

How did he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Article of the two Natures in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> but by giving them the definition of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> and the Letter of Pope <hi>Leo</hi>? Upon what Reaſons did he ground the Article of the Remiſſion of Original ſin in Baptiſm when the <hi>Armenians</hi> were guilty in this Point of a Capital Error, as appears by the information of <hi>Benedict</hi> XII? What Proofs did he bring to ſhew 'em that the Conſecration of the Euchariſt is made by the words of our Saviour, when the <hi>Armenians</hi> believ'd the contrary, as we may ſee in the ſame information? Theſe kind of Remarks which are uſual with Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> have neither light nor Solidity in them. <hi>Eugenius</hi> is excuſable let Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſay what he will; he thought it no wiſe neceſſary, to inſert common Places in his Decretal, nor to be ſo ſcrupulous in obſerving <hi>Heads or Tails,</hi> like ſuch as view the <hi>Dragon</hi> in the Firmament.

                        <p>WE ſhall in the following Chapter ſearch into the Grounds of his Opinion, and the Proofs he brings, only mentioning here ſeveral Proteſtants, whoſe Teſtimony is the leſs to be ſuſpected, in aſmuch as, what they wrote was not all deſign'd for our controverſie. We have already ſeen in the Diſcourſe about the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> that <hi>Laſicius</hi> a <hi>Polander</hi> writing of the <hi>Armenians</hi> of <hi>Leopolis</hi> ſay's, they believe the Bread and Wine retain their firſt Nature. <hi>They deny,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>that in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Joann Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius de Rel. Armeni.</note> 
                           <hi>the Elements loſe their Nature. They adminiſter the Sacrament with Wheaten Bread dipt in the Cup. They mingle no water with the Wine. They ſhew a greater reſpect to the Sacrament than the</hi> Ruſſians, <hi>believing our Saviour Chriſt is therein</hi> ſuch as he was Born of the Virgin, and after the Incarnation <hi>there was ſuch a Conjunction, and affinity, between the Divine and Humane Nature, that they were not ſeparated in the Sufferings of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>nor ever can be. They have this Opinion from St.</hi> Chryſoſtom <hi>that</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>ſuffers ſomething more in the Euchariſt than he ſuffered on the Croſs, becauſe in the Euchariſt he ſuffers the Sacramental fraction. And when I demanded of them how this could be, ſeeing the Nature of Bread and Wine remains without being changed after the Conſecration, they anſwered me, This was effected by the Divine virtue, to which we ought to give credit.</hi> And theſe are <hi>Laſicius</hi> his words, according to the Original, but different from Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Verſion. It now concerns us to inquire into the advantage or prejudice which hence accrue to the cauſe I defend, for if on one hand I pretend to prove by what has bin aboveſaid that the <hi>Armenians</hi> belive not <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> undertakes to prove by it alſo that they believe the real Preſence. But as to my pretention I think 'tis well grounded and beyond all Queſtion, ſeeing this Author ſay's expreſly they deny the Elements loſe their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>HE has had his informations,</hi> ſay's Mr. <hi>Arnaud, only from ſome Ignorant</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 5. C. 4. p. 449.</note> 
                           <hi>Perſons in</hi> Leopolis. If this be a ſufficient ground for rejecting the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Laſicius</hi> in reference to <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> why do's Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> cite the ſame Teſtimony to ſhew the <hi>Armenians</hi> believe the real Preſence? Has this Author met with ignorant perſons for the informing him in one Point, and knowing ones for the other? <hi>perhaps,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>he did not comprehend that by the word Nature, they meant only the Maſs of external Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</hi> But he ought to aſſert things more likely to be probable. Where will <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> he find the <hi>Armenians</hi> ever took the term <hi>Nature, for the Maſs of external accidents</hi> ſeperate from their ſubſtance? The exiſtence of accidents without a ſubject is one of thoſe Difficulties of which (he himſelf tells us in another place) <hi>the</hi> Greeks, <hi>the</hi> Armenians <hi>and Copticks of our times make no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Why then would he have 'em to uſe in a familiar Diſcourſe the <note place="margin">Lib. 10. C. 8.</note> word Nature to ſignify a thing which is unknown to 'em, or of which at leaſt they make no mention? Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> makes and marrs theſe Principles
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41961:217"/> according as his occaſions require, <hi>Diruit, aedificat, mutat quadrata rotundis.</hi> Which ſhews his Anſwers mere Evaſions, and in effect there's no Body that reads theſe words of <hi>Laſicius,</hi> but will immediately comprehend they mean the <hi>Armenians</hi> deny <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> Now this is preciſely the Point in queſtion between the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> and me. Hitherto our Diſputes has not concern'd the real Preſence.</p>
                        <p>BUT ſeeing he is deſirous to treat of it, I muſt tell him there is a great deal of difference between his pretenſion and mine, that mine is grounded on clear expreſſions which are not capable of any other ſence; whereas on the contrary his are eſtabliſhed on obſcure and Ambiguous Terms, of which he has not comprehended the ſence. For theſe Perſons ſay only <hi>That our Saviour Chriſt is in the Euchariſt ſuch as he was born of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> Mary. Now we have already ſeen that according to them, <hi>Mary</hi> only brought forth the Divine Nature, which had only a Body in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> and not really. Upon this Hypotheſis their ſence will be, that the Divinity being every where, it muſt of Conſequence be in the Euchariſt. And with this agrees what they add, <hi>that after the Incarnation, there was ſuch a conjunction and ſociety between the Divine and Humane Natures, that they were not ſeperate even in the Sufferings of</hi> Chriſt. For by this Conjunction they underſtood not a Union which leaves the two <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> diſtinct, for in ſo ſaying they would not contradict the Orthodox ſence, but they meant a Confuſion of the Humane Nature with the Divine, a ſwallowing up of this Humane Nature into the Abyſs of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as we have already ſeen they commonly held. So that all the real Preſence which they Underſtand in the Sacrament, is no other than the preſence of the Divinity, which is every where, but more eſpecially in the Euchariſt. 'Tis very probable 'twas under this Equivocation the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of <hi>Armenia</hi> Minor ſheltred himſelf in the anſwer he made to the Articles of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VI. which we have related in the preceeding Chapter. <hi>The Body of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, ſay's he, <hi>Born of the Virgin, dead on the Croſs, and which is now alive in Heaven, is in the Sacrament of the Altar under the ſpecies and repreſentation of Bread.</hi> The Body Born of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and Dead on the Croſs, which was to ſay, according to them, the Divinity, which in being Born of the Virgin had the appearance of a Body and Dyed in appearance on the Croſs. But when he was urged to acknowledge 'twas the ſame <hi>Numerical Body,</hi> he would not grant it, becauſe he believed the term Number reduc'd the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> into the ſame Rank with other Humane Bodies, and conſequently made it a real Body. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will reply, this is one of my Conjectures which has no ſurer foundation than his <hi>may be ſo's.</hi> But he has no other Grounds for his <hi>may be's</hi> than his own Imagination, whereas I lay my Conjectures on the very Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> having firſt ſolidly ſhewn 'tis ſuch as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it.</p>
                        <p>WE may add to the Teſtimony of <hi>Laſicius</hi> that of <hi>Breerewood,</hi> in his <note place="margin">

Afterwards he ſays he does not believe Mr. <hi>Arnaud dares now juſtify, that in the Original Engliſh there is no mention of the real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, nor affirm 'tis a mere impoſture of the Calviniſtical Tranſlator. That he alſo affirms whatſoever is to be met with in page 249 and 250, concerning the Baptiſm of the</hi> Armenians, <hi>their Proſelytes, Faſts, Images, Prieſts, their Belief touching Purgatory, their Superſtitions, and Efforts which the</hi> Jeſuits <hi>have made to ſubject them to the See of</hi> Rome, <hi>is really contained in the Original</hi> Engliſh, <hi>there being nothing of his Invention in all this. And</hi> to juſtifye it relates at length <hi>Herbert</hi>'s own words in that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:41961:218"/>
                        <p>THIS ſo well grounded defence, has obliged Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to retract in the Second Edition of his Book this accuſation Printed in the Firſt. He has retrenched all thoſe Injurious Diſcourſes againſt the Reputation, and ſincerity of Mr. <hi>Vicqfort,</hi> and acknowledged his Tranſlation to be faithful and exactly according to the Original. He has at the ſame time diſcovered to us the cauſe of his miſtake, to wit, that there having bin two Editions of <hi>Herbert</hi>'s Book one in 1634, th'other in 1635. in which the Author contained himſelf within the Relation of his Voyage; and the Second in 1638, wherein he had added ſeveral particulars relating to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Hiſtory, thoſe whom he conſulted had ſeen only the firſt Edition, but that Mr. <hi>Vicqfort</hi> Tranſlated from the Second in which was found the Paſſage in queſtion.</p>
                        <p>I am far from being of that Humour to inſult over Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> in this Occaſion, nor draw advantage from his precipitous way of falling foul on Authors, who mean not the leaſt hurt to him. I do not doubt but he is troubled at his own raſhneſs in grounding a charge of this importance on a ſuppoſition, he has found to be falſe, without conſidering whether there might not be more Editions of <hi>Herbert</hi> than one. But he muſt ſuffer me to tell him that what he has inſerted in his Marginal Notes is not a ſufficient excuſe for him, <hi>the</hi> French <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> ſays he, <hi>making no mention of two different Editions of this</hi> Engliſh <hi>Book, we could not Divine it.</hi> Much leſs could <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Lib. 5. C.</hi> 8. 2. Edition.</note> the Tranſlator Divine he would be accus'd for an Impoſtour, for not having declared there were two Editions of this Book. Theſe kind of Accuſations pronounced with ſuch confidence do ſuppoſe a Man to have made an exact Inquiry before he utters them, whereas had Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> taken the leaſt pains in this reſpect he might have eaſily diſcovered there was a Second Edition of <hi>Herbert</hi>'s Book, and found what he has bin ſince ſhewed. He needed not divine but certainly inform himſelf, for this Book being Printed at <hi>London</hi> in 1638, and being moreover famous in that kind, he might have been ſoon ſatisfyed concerning it. But ſuppoſing he could not, he ought not preſently to call a Perſon a Deceiver: But rather to have propoſed his doubts, and require a ſolution of Mr. <hi>Vicqfort</hi> himſelf, and not thus raſhly charge a Gentleman that never offended him. I could willingly forbear mentioning this particular, Mr. <hi>Vicqfort</hi> having no need of my Apology, did not the intereſt of my cauſe oblige me to declare to the World how little confidence we ought to have in Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Diſcourſes, if they be not upheld by ſolid and convincing Proofs, which they never are, as appears from this whole diſpute.</p>
                        <p>BUT laying aſide this conteſt ſee we what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> offers againſt the Authority of <hi>Herbert,</hi> who expreſly affirms the <hi>Armenians</hi> deny the real Preſence. <hi>We matter not,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the advantage which the</hi> Calviniſts <note place="margin">
                              <hi>C.</hi> 8. 2. Edition.</note> 
                           <hi>would make of this Teſtimony of</hi> Herbert, <hi>who to enlarge the Second Edition of his Book, has added what he pleaſed, touching the Religion of thoſe People through whoſe Countrys he travelled, without telling us from whom he learnt what he Relates of them, for he only ſays what he has taken out of Authors of his own Sect, who have treated of them, as</hi> Breerewood <hi>has done. Thoſe Authentick Proofs which we have produced touching the faith of the</hi> Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians <hi>do fully ſolve this Point. And not to mention others, there is no compariſon between a</hi> Calviniſt <hi>who ſpeaks in his own cauſe, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his intereſts, without Authority and proofs, and a</hi> Lutheran, <hi>ſuch a</hi>
                           <pb n="43" facs="tcp:41961:218"/> 
                           <hi>one as Mr.</hi> Olearius <hi>is, who ſpeaks againſt himſelf and his own intereſt, and cites the Perſons from whom he learnt what he tells us.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has ſoon forgotten what he wrote on this ſame ſubject <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. firſt Edition.</note> in his firſt Edition, <hi>We may well admire,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>that Mr.</hi> Claude, <hi>who is wont to propoſe ſlight Objections, ſhould omit one, which is very conſiderable in appearance, and enough to ſtartle People, becauſe the ſolution of it is ſo hard to be found, that we cannot justly reproach him, if he be ignorant of it. The Objection is, that we meet with this paſſage in a Tranſlation of</hi> Herbert'<hi>s Voyages, That the</hi> Armenians <hi>deny the real preſence of the Body of</hi> Chriſt. <hi>It ſeems there can be nothing replyed to ſo clear a paſſage, and that this Author who tells us what he learnt from the Inhabitants themſelves of thoſe Countrys, as well as Mr.</hi> Olearius, <hi>may at leaſt weaken his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>WHENCE I pray comes this ſo manifeſt a contrariety of judgment? As long as the pretended Impoſture of the Tranſlator continues in Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s thoughts, <hi>Herbert</hi>'s Authority is <hi>weighty and ſufficient to ſtartle People, the ſolution of it is difficult, and it ſeems there can be nothing replyed to ſo plain a paſſage.</hi> But ſo ſoon as this pretended Impoſture vaniſhes, then 'tis, <hi>we matter not the Teſtimony of</hi> Herbert, <hi>and judicious Perſons ought not to credit it. Before he was an Author who ſpeaks what he learnt from the Inhabitants themſelves thro whoſe Countrys he paſſed.</hi> Now he is a Perſon <hi>that to enlarge his Book has in his Second Edition added what he pleaſes.</hi> Before he was an Author, <hi>who may well weaken the Authority of Mr.</hi> Olearius, <hi>now he is a</hi> Calviniſt <hi>in no wiſe comparable with a</hi> Lutheran, <hi>ſuch as Mr.</hi> Olearius. What is this but a ſporting with Authors, extolling 'um, depreſſing them, and making 'um good or bad according as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Occaſions require. 'Tis plain he wants an object to exerciſe his w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ath on; if it be not the Tranſlator, it muſt then be the Author; and when the living eſcapes him, then the Dead muſt pay for't. Who told Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> that what Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> relates in his Second Edition is not what he Learnt from the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants themſelves thro whoſe Countrys he travelled, but Excerptions from <hi>Breerewood? He dared not mention,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>from whom he learnt what he relates.</hi> If this be ſufficient to invalidate the Teſtimony of Travellers, we can be certain in nothing they tell us touching the manners of People, and their Religions; for it ſeldom happens that Travellers denote the Perſons from whom they have bin inform'd, and if they be unfaithful in reſpect of the things they tell us, they may be as well ſo in reference to the naming of Perſons.</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Herbert</hi> was a Perſon of Quality, deſervedly Honourable both for his Learning and Integrity. He has viewed whatſoever was worth his Obſervation both in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Affrica,</hi> and carefully denoted the manners and Religions of People, writing nothing till ſuch time as he was well informed of the Truth of it. What means Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> then thus to attack his Memory, and tells us that a Perſon thus qualifyed has copyed out from <hi>Breerewood,</hi> that is to ſay, from a Scholar who perhaps never travelled farther than his own Country?</p>

                           <hi>BUT here are,</hi> ſay's Mr. <hi>Arnaud, certain and poſitive Proofs which ſhew that the</hi> Armenians <hi>have ever effectually believed both one</hi>

                           <hi>and the other Point, and that there is no reaſon to accuſe them of denying the real Preſence or</hi> Tranſubſtantiation. <hi>Which we ſhall now Examine in this Chapter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>HIS firſt Proof is taken from the Teſtimony of <hi>Lanfranc,</hi> who diſputing againſt <hi>Berengarius</hi> ſay's, <hi>that the</hi> Greeks <hi>and</hi> Armenians, <hi>and generally all Chriſtians hold the ſame faith as the</hi> Roman <hi>Church.</hi> But Mr. <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                           <hi>Arnaud</hi> has not conſidered that <hi>Lanfranc</hi> do's not directly impute <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation</hi> either to the <hi>Armenians,</hi> or <hi>Greeks,</hi> he imputes it to 'um only by a Conſequence drawn from their glorying all of 'um that they receive in the Sacrament, <hi>the real Body and real Blood of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>taken from the Virgin.</hi> Now we have ſeen as well by the Relation of <hi>Carmes,</hi> as from the Information of <hi>Benedict,</hi> that the <hi>Armenians</hi> gave this expreſſion a ſence wholly contrary to <hi>Lanfranc</hi>'s Conſequence, ſo that this Proof has bin already invalidated by the Teſtimony of the <hi>Armenians</hi> themſelves.</p>
                        <p>THE Second is taken from the <hi>Berengarians</hi> never alledging they were of the ſentiment of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> or any other Eaſtern Church. Yet was it impoſſible but they muſt know what was their Opinion, ſeeing that Perſons Voyaged from all parts of <hi>Europe</hi> into the <hi>East,</hi> and this would have bin a ſpecious pretence to the <hi>Henricians</hi> and <hi>Albingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to avoid the rigour of thoſe puniſhments they underwent. But to diſcover the weakneſs of this reaſoning we need only remember that in the 14 Century under <hi>John</hi> XXII. <hi>Benedict</hi> XII. and <hi>Clement</hi> VI. it was held in the Weſt for an undoubted truth that the <hi>Armenians</hi> denyed <hi>Tranſubstantiation,</hi> and the real Preſence, as we have already ſeen in the foregoing Chapter. That 'twas the unanimous Report of the <hi>Armenians</hi> themſelves who were in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the <hi>Latins</hi> which had bin in <hi>Armenia.</hi> Yet altho the Diſciples of <hi>Berengarius</hi> were rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly perſecuted in that age, we do not find they ever juſtifyed themſelves by the example of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> nor that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> handled them leſs ſeverely upon the account of this conformity. We find on the contrary, their adverſaries have reproached them with following the Hereſie of theſe Eaſtern People, as appears by what I have already related concerning the diſputes of <hi>Thomas Waldenſis</hi> againſt <hi>Wicliff,</hi> ſo that that was objected againſt them as a Crime which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would have them make uſe of for an Apology.</p>
                        <p>THE III. and IV. Proof are no more concluſive than the two firſt. <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 459.</note> They contain that <hi>Gregory</hi> VII marking in particular the Errors which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41961:219"/> the <hi>Armenians</hi> ought to condemn to the end they might be received into the Communion of the Church, makes no mention of any Error againſt the real Preſence and <hi>Tranſubstantiation.</hi> That in the year 1145. The Patriarch and Biſhops of <hi>Armenia</hi> ſent Embaſſadors to Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> II. to render him all kind of Submiſſion, and make him judge of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fferences which they had with the <hi>Greeks.</hi> That if this Pope had believed they were in the Error of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> he would not have bin contented to inſtruct them in the Ceremonies of the Church and manner of Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Sacrifice. That <hi>Othon</hi> of <hi>Friſinga</hi> who relate this Hiſtory would never have concealed ſo important a circumſtance. I anſwer that <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. <note place="margin">Baron ad. con. 114.</note> particularizes only four Errors, for which he Cenſures the <hi>Armenians.</hi> I. That they mix no water with their Wine in the Chalice. II. That they compound the Chream with Butter, and not with Balm. III. That they reverence <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> as a Saint, altho he was condemned. In fine, that they added the (ſign) of the Croſs to the <hi>Triaſagios</hi> after the manner of Hereticks. How many other Doctrines and Cuſtoms have the <hi>Armeuians</hi> beſides theſe four Articles, which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church do's not approve of? They hold the Opinions of <hi>Eutyches.</hi> They do not hold the Doctrine of the Propagation of Original ſin. They deny <hi>Purgatory.</hi> They ſtill offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices after the manner of the <hi>Jews.</hi> They condemn third Marriages, for as bad as Fornication. They deny the Sacrament of Confirmation. They do not hold the Conſecration of the Bread is made by the only words of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> They believe the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father alone, and ſeveral other Points which ſeperate 'um from the <hi>Latins,</hi> and of which neither <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. <hi>Eugenius</hi> III. nor <hi>Othon</hi> of <hi>Triſinga</hi> make any mention. Which ſhews there can be drawn no Concluſion from their ſilence, and that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> may better employ his time than in collecting theſe kind of Proofs.</p>
                        <p>THE V. is taken from ſome expreſſions of a Catholick of <hi>Armenia,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 460.</note> who ſay's, in the conference of <hi>Theorien, that the Wine becomes by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration the Blood of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>and that the Son of God is Sacrificed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church for the Salvation of the World.</hi> But this Proof is too weak to confirm what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> pretends. For firſt we have already ſhewed him that this Catholick ſpake of his own head, and not from his Church. And moreover, what he ſay's do's neither conclude the real Preſence, nor <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> The Wine becomes by its Conſecration the Blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in repreſentation and myſtery, according to the expoſition which the <hi>Armenians</hi> themſelves give to theſe ways of ſpeaking, as we have ſeen in the foregoing Chapter, and the Son of God is Sacrificed in the Church in Commemortion, inaſmuch as the action of the Euchariſt is a Myſtery which repreſents his death. Let Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> conſult (if he pleaſes) the Marginal Note which is on the ſide of this laſt paſſage, and he will find the ſolution of his Difficulty. The <hi>Greek</hi> Text has <gap reason="foreign">

                        </p>
                        <p>THE VI. Proof is taken from that during the Croiſado's the Popes <note place="margin">Ibid. pag. 462.</note> held a laſting and ſtrict Union with the Church of <hi>Armenia.</hi> That the Catholick of <hi>Armenia,</hi> yielded obedience to Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> III. That this Union was confirmed under <hi>Innocent</hi> III. who ſent a Crown to <hi>Leo</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and that as well this King, as <hi>Gregory</hi> the Patriarch
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41961:220"/> of <hi>Armenia,</hi> ſent an Ambaſſador to <hi>Innocent</hi> to acknowledge the Primacy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. That there were Alliances made between the <hi>Latin</hi> Princes and thoſe of <hi>Armenia.</hi> That Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> at the requeſt of the Templars, and ſome time after gave him Abſolution. That this Union laſted during <hi>Gregory</hi> IX. his time, and <hi>Clement</hi> VI.</p>
                        <p>BUT what is this but a telling of Stories, and copying out of <hi>Raynadus</hi> at any rate. If the proof which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> pretends to draw from this Union be ſufficient to conclude the <hi>Armenians</hi> were conformable to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Doctrines of the real Preſence and <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> 'twill be ſufficient to conclude likewiſe that they were conformable to her in all the other Points concerning which we do not find the Popes ever troubled themſelves to correct them, or make the leaſt inquiries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them. They were ſatisfyed in the Kings and Patriachs of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia</hi>'s acknowledging their Authority, hoping by this means to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce hereafter quietly amongſt them the Religion and Ceremonies of the <hi>Latins,</hi> and in the mean time made uſe of 'em in other occaſions. The Kings of <hi>Armenia</hi> on the other hand were very ready to give the Popes encouragement to believe they would reduce their Kingdoms to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyſance of the <hi>Roman</hi> See, and in the mean time procured the aſſiſtance and protection of the <hi>Latins,</hi> whoſe power was then Formidable through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Eaſt. But this did not hinder the <hi>Armenians</hi> from keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill their Doctrines and Cuſtoms, as appears by what we have ſeen in the preceeding Chapter of <hi>John</hi> XXII, <hi>Benedict</hi> XII and <hi>Clement</hi> VI. The 79 Article of the information of <hi>Benedict</hi> expreſly mentions, <hi>That the Prieſts and Biſhops of</hi> Armenia <hi>enjoyned a pennance during ſome years to thoſe that had bin Baptized by the</hi> Latins, <hi>and condemned them to undergo a 5 years pennance who had received from them the other Sacrament.</hi> And the 86 Article. <hi>That the</hi> Armenians <hi>ſay, and hold, that ſince the Council of</hi> Chalcedon, <hi>the</hi> Roman <hi>Prelate has no more Authority over them which are under him then the Patriarch of the</hi> Neſtorians <hi>over the</hi> Neſtorians, <hi>or the</hi> Greek <hi>Patriarch over the</hi> Greeks, <hi>that the Pope knows his own power and the</hi> Armenians <hi>likewiſe theirs.</hi> And the 99<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article; <hi>that the</hi> Armenians <hi>perſecute thoſe amongſt them who have been Baptiſed according to the form of the</hi> Latins, <hi>and hold the Faith of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, and that they ſay the</hi> Roman <hi>Church Errs, and that they</hi> Armenians <hi>keep the true and Catholick Faith.</hi> And the 117<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Article. <hi>That the</hi> Armenians <hi>keep not the true Faith which the</hi> Roman <hi>Church holds, nor its Sacraments, and Blaſphemes againſt the</hi> Roman <hi>Church the Pope and his Cardinals, ſaying they are Hereticks. That the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick of</hi> Armenia <hi>minor ſay'd, the Pope and Cardinals destroyed more Men every day than they had Hairs on their heads. And altho they preach againſt Simony, yet do they grant no favour without committing it; that as to them</hi> Armenians <hi>they had all of 'um kept themſelves undefiled in</hi> Armenia <hi>minor, except the King and ſome Perſons of Quality who held the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith.</hi> 'Tis then to no purpoſe for Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to tell us that <hi>Innocent</hi> III. and the other Popes would not have held ſo ſtrict a Union with the <hi>Armenian</hi> Church had they believed the <hi>Armenians</hi> were <hi>Berengarians,</hi> ſeeing they did at the ſame time ſtir up all <hi>France</hi> againſt the <hi>Albingenſes,</hi> and cauſed 'um to be exterminated with Fire and Sword. Theſe excellent Reaſons do not hinder, but that the <hi>Armenians</hi> held ſtill all their Opinions contrary to the Doctrines of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church under the Popedom of <hi>Benedict</hi> XII. And II. that amongſt thoſe Opinions, that which denys <hi>Tranſubstantiation</hi>
                           <pb n="47" facs="tcp:41961:220"/> and the real Preſence is plainly remarked. III. That altho the Kings and ſome Perſons of Quality embraced the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, yet the Body of the <hi>Armenian</hi> Church kept to their Ancient Religion, even to the blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, the Pope, and his Cardinals, according to the Terms of the Article which I now mention'd. IV. In fine it will not be found, that <hi>Innocent</hi> III. or any other Pope required of the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> any particular Renunciation of their Errors, be they what they will. It ſeems either theſe Popes ſuppoſed the <hi>Armenians</hi> had abſolutely the ſame Faith as the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, or diſſembled theſe Errors, in hopes, as I already ſay'd, that in eſtabliſhing their Authority in <hi>Armenia,</hi> they might introduce amongſt them the Religion of the <hi>Latins,</hi> by means of their Emiſſaries which the Kings favoured, and to whom ſome Biſhops gave liberty to preach, as appears by the 78 Article of the Information of <hi>Benedict. The Catholick of</hi> Armenia <hi>minor,</hi> ſay's this Article, <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating Six Biſhops has drawn from them a Publick Act, in which they ſolemnly promiſe, to ſuffer no longer their Youth to learn the</hi> Latin <hi>Tongue, and to give no more liberty to the</hi> Latin <hi>Preachers, who Preach the Faith of the Holy</hi> Roman <hi>Church in their Dioceſs, or Province.

                           <hi>and</hi> Roman <hi>Church, when their King receiv'd the Kingdom from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> Henry, <hi>and the Regal Crown from the hands of the Arch-Biſhop of</hi> Mayence, <hi>yet would they not part with any of their Ancient Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies or Cuſtoms.</hi> And theſe were their Reunions with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
                        <p>'TIS true there was in thoſe Times one of their Kings named <hi>Hayton,</hi> who marvellouſly favoured the <hi>Latins,</hi> and perhaps 'twas he of whom Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſpeaks, who took on him at laſt the Habit of St. <hi>Francis.</hi> But be it as it will, this King did all he could to introduce the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion into <hi>Armenia,</hi> but in vain. Obſerve here the words of the Information of <hi>Benedict</hi> Art. 116. <hi>A King of</hi> Armenia <hi>called</hi> Hayton <hi>aſſembled all the Doctours and Biſhops of his Kingdom together with the Patriarch to unite 'um to the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, and diſpute with the Legat which the</hi> Roman <hi>Church had ſent; But the diſpute being ended the King acknowledged the Truth was on the</hi> Romaniſts <hi>ſide, and that the</hi> Armenians <hi>were in an Error, and therefore ever ſince, the Kings of</hi> Armenia <hi>minor have embrac'd the faith of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church. Yet were not the Biſhops Doctours and Princes ſatisfied with this, and</hi>
                           <pb n="48" facs="tcp:41961:221"/> 
                           <hi>after the departure of the Legat a Doctor named</hi> Vartan <hi>wrote a Book againſt the Pope and his Legat, and againſt the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, in which he calls the Pope a Proud</hi> Pharaoh <hi>who with all his Subjects are drowned in the Sea of Hereſy. He ſays that</hi> Pharaoh'<hi>s Embaſſadour, meaning the Legat, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed home with ſhame.</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis to be obſerved that this Book of Dr. <hi>Vartan</hi>'s altho full of paſſionate Invectives againſt the Pope and his Church, yet was receiv'd in <hi>Armenia,</hi> as if it had bin the Canons of the Apoſtles.</p>
                        <p>WHICH conſidered, I ſee no reaſon to prize ſo much theſe feign'd Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the Kings of <hi>Armenia</hi> have ſometimes yielded to the Pope by their Embaſſadors, as for inſtance ſuch as was that of King <hi>Oſinius</hi> paid to <hi>John</hi> XXII. by a Biſhop who in the name of the King, and his Kingdom, made ſuch a profeſſion of faith as they deſired. To make this a proof, as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> do's, is either to be ignorant, or diſſemble the Genius of this Nation. The <hi>Armenians</hi> in the exigency of their affairs, made no ſcruple to ſend to the Pope Perſons, that promiſed him whatſoever he deſired, but as ſoon as ever the danger was over, and they had obtain'd of the <hi>Latins</hi> what they deſired, they made a mock at their promiſes, as <hi>Clement</hi> VI. reproaches them in his Letters to the King, and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick of <hi>Armenia,</hi> as we have already obſerved in the preceding Chapter.</p>
                        <p>WHICH has bin well obſerved by the Author of the Book called the Ambaſſage of Dr. <hi>Garcias de Sylva Figueroa.

                           <hi>of the Inhabitants of the new</hi> Zulpha, <hi>who are</hi> Armenians <hi>by birth, is the Chriſtian, together with the Opinions which the Pope ſuffers them to retain. But to ſpeak the truth there are very few that reverence, or acknowledge the Pope; almoſt all of 'um obſtinately retaining their own ancient Religion. For altho ſeveral of the Biſhops and Prieſts of their Nation that have paſſed over into</hi> Europe, <hi>(moved thereunto by their extream poverty, their expences in travelling, and intollerable perſecutions of the</hi> Turks, <hi>during the continual Wars between them and the</hi> Perſians,) <hi>have often offered to obey the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, yet when this was to be concluded, they have ſtill fallen off, and refuſed to acknowledg any other Authority than that of their Patriarch, obſtinately retaining their ancient Ceremonies and Liturgys.</hi> This has bin the perpetual complaint of the <hi>Latins.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has imagined this a ſecret to us.</p>
                        <p>THERE is perhaps more heed to be given to what he alledges touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a certain Perſon named <hi>Gerlac,</hi> who belonged to the Ambaſſador ſent from the Emperour to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> about an hundred years ſince. This <hi>Gerlac</hi> relates in one of his Letters a Diſcourſe he had in matters of Religion with the Patriarch of the <hi>Armenians</hi> at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and amongſt other things he tells us, <hi>They hold that the real Body of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>is preſent in the Sacrament in its proper Substance</hi> (He means the ſame as they of the <hi>Auſbourg</hi> Confeſſion) <hi>In caena Domini verum &amp; Substantiale Corpus &amp; Sanguinem Chriſti adeſſe dicunt, ſed videntur Tranſubſtantiationem probare.</hi> But upon the reading of this Letter, it will ſoon appear that, this Patriarch with whom he diſcourſed, gave him his own private ſentiments, and not the Doctrines of the <hi>Armenian</hi> Religion. For he tells him, <hi>that he believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and confeſſed that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, contrary to what the</hi> Greeks <hi>hold.</hi> Yet do's it appear from the conſtant
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41961:221"/> teſtimony of Authors, who treated of the Opinions of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> that they hold the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father alone, and are in this particular at accord with the <hi>Greeks</hi> againſt the <hi>Latins.</hi> So ſay's <hi>Guy Carmes,</hi> the information of <hi>Benedict</hi> XII. <hi>Prateolus, Breerewood</hi> and ſeveral others, and therefore the firſt thing <hi>Eugenius</hi> IV. did in the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> when he gave his inſtructions to the <hi>Armenians,</hi> was to oblige them to receive the Symbol with the addition of the <hi>Filioque.</hi> Beſides this <hi>Gerlac</hi>'s Patriarch expreſly declares he holds the Doctrine of the Ubiquity, that is to ſay, of the preſence of the Humane Nature in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whereſoever the Divinity is, which is not the real belief of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> as we have already ſufficiently proved. <hi>Gerlac</hi> adds, <hi>That they acknowledge the</hi> Roman <hi>Prelate to be the Head of the Univerſal Church,</hi> which is not true, as appears as well by the information of <hi>Benedict,</hi> as by the Teſtimony of ſeveral other Authors. 'Tis moreover apparent that his affirming them to believe the Subſtantial Preſence of the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in the Sacrament is only grounded on this pretended Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Ubiquity, which grants this Body to be every where, and by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence in the Sacrament. And as to <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> he do's not abſolutely impute it to 'em, but ſay's they ſeem to admit of it, <hi>videntur,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>Tranſubſtantiationem probare.</hi> Let the reader judge whether this Tranſlation be faithful. <hi>It appears,</hi> is an expreſſion which gives the <hi>idea</hi> of a thing clear and evident, whereas every one knows that the <hi>videtur</hi> of the <hi>Latins</hi> which Anſwers our <hi>Engliſh</hi> word <hi>It ſeems,</hi> gives the <hi>Idea</hi> of a thing which has the likelyhood and colour, but which is not abſolutely out of doubt, of a thing which we may think to be true, but of which we have no certainty. 'Tis likely <hi>Gerlac</hi> grounded his <hi>videntur</hi> on the General Term <hi>to change,</hi> which the <hi>Armenian</hi> Patriarch made uſe of, but in effect this Term do's not ſignify a <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi> and 'twas only <hi>Gerlac</hi>'s prejudice which perſwaded him it did.</p>
                        <p>THE ſame prejudice may be obſerved in Mr. <hi>Olearius</hi> as appears from his own words, <hi>I was informed,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>by the Patriarch of</hi> Armenia <hi>who viſited us at</hi> Schamachia <hi>a City of</hi> Media, <hi>that the</hi> Armenians, <hi>held</hi> Tranſubſtantiation. <hi>Now believing</hi> Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>that is to ſay, the change of Bread and Wine into the Body and Blood of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>'tis not to be queſtioned but they hold the true and real Preſence.</hi> His Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in reference to the <hi>Armenians</hi> is only grounded on a <hi>that is to ſay,</hi> as it was in reſpect of the <hi>Moſcovites:</hi> If you deny his explanation, his Teſtimony ſignifies nothing.</p>
                        <p>AS to the atteſtations which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> produces of <hi>Hacciadour</hi> the Patriarch of the <hi>Armenians</hi> reunited to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and who is now at <hi>Rome</hi> where Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> tells us he has taken care to have him conſulted, and of <hi>Uſcanus Vardapet</hi> an <hi>Armenian</hi> Biſhop who was not long ſince at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> we know very well there's little heed to be given to theſe ſort of People teſtimony; who never come into the Weſtern parts but upon the Account of ſome Temporal intereſt; and never fail to Anſwer as you would have them. The <hi>Latins</hi> and the Popes themſelves have bin often deceiv'd, and if I may not be believed, let <hi>Anthony de Goureau</hi> an Emiſſary of the Miſſion of <hi>Hiſpaham</hi> be conſulted, who in the Hiſtory he wrote concerning the reduction of the <hi>Armenians</hi> of <hi>Perſia</hi> tells us, <hi>that altho in the Union made in the Council of</hi> Florence,

                           <hi>likewiſe, yet theſe People proceeded not with that fervour and diligence which was requiſit in a matter of that importance; on the contrary they were ſo little mindfull of it, thro the malice or negligence of their Prelats, that I do not find amongſt them the leaſt ſign of this reduction, nor any thing which this Council decreed, nor Obedience thereunto recommended. There is no mention of it in their Books and Traditions. And I wonder that</hi> John Laurens <hi>of</hi> Anania <hi>in his</hi> Univerſal Fabrick ſhould ſay, <hi>that the</hi> Armenians <hi>almoſt in General have lately received the determinations of the</hi> Trent <hi>Council, ſeeing not ſo much as the name of it was ſcarce ever heard by the Biſhops or Patriarch, nor have they altered any of their Cuſtoms either good or bad, for this many Ages. But perhaps this Author was informed of this by ſome</hi> Armenians <hi>paſſing throughout</hi> Europe, <hi>or that dwell therein upon the account of Trade, who for the moſt part return anſwers according to the deſires of thoſe that aſk 'um, and that they may not fail therein, do very often ſpeak contrary to truth, which the Biſhops and Prelates of theſe Schiſmaticks who come to</hi> Rome <hi>often do to gratifie the Pope, promiſing their Flocks ſhall yield Obedience to him, but at their return home, they ſoon forget their engagements.</hi> Let any one then judge of what weight the atteſtations of theſe People are, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Diſcourſes of <hi>Hacciadour</hi> and <hi>Vardapet,</hi> are to be preferred before ſo many other convincing Teſtimonies which aſſert the contrary of what they affirm.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Lib. 5. C. 10. p. 491.</note> pretends they all of 'um hold the real Preſence and <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>AS to the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> he grounds his Opinion concerning them on the ſilence of Ancient and Modern Authors, who never told us the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> differ from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this particular. He adds that the Emiſſaries ſent by the Pope into theſe countrys to endeavour their reduction to the Obedience of the <hi>Roman</hi> See, never diſcovered any thing to make 'um ſuſpect the Faith of the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> touching the Euchariſt. He ſay's in fine, that when the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> reunited themſelves to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they were never required to make any particular declaration of their belief in reference to the Euchariſt.</p>
                        <p>BUT as to what reſpects the ſilence of Authors, we have already anſwer'd in the caſe of the <hi>Moſcovits,</hi> that they do only chiefly obſerve
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41961:222"/> thoſe points which are expreſly controverted between the other Churches and the <hi>Roman,</hi> deſcending not ſo far as to particularize all other matters, which theſe Churches do or do not hold.</p>
                        <p>THE ſame may be ſaid touching the ſilence of the Emiſſaries. The Emiſſaries have contented themſelves in mentioning thoſe Errors from which they have freed the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> without mentioning the new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which they have taught 'um; and this indeed concludes they have not bin obliged to introduce <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> amongſt theſe People by way of diſpute, being a Point, againſt which the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd; but this do's not hinder them from being oblig'd to bring it in by way of inſtruction, as being a Doctrine not compriſed in their Ancient Religion, and which they ought now to receive, to the end they may become conformable to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
                        <p>WHICH juſtifies it ſelf by the conduct of the Popes themſelves, who have ſent the Emiſſaries, for they ever recommended to them this profeſſion of Faith which we have ſo often already mention'd, and which expreſly contains the Article of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> in theſe terms, <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum Euchariſtiae ex azymo conficit</hi> Romana <hi>Eccleſia, tenens et docens, quod in ipſo Sacramento, Panis verè</hi> Tranſubſtantiatur <hi>in Corpus, &amp; Vinum in Sanguinem</hi> Domini <hi>noſtri</hi> Jeſu Chriſti. <hi>The</hi> Roman <hi>Church Celebrates the Sacrament with Unleavened Bread, holding and teaching, that in this Sacrament the Bread is really</hi> Tranſubſtantiated <hi>into the Body, and the Wine into the Blood of our Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>THE Popes have ever earneſtly recommended to the Miſſionaries the inſtructing of the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> and other Eaſtern Chriſtians according to this Formulary. They have ſent it to the <hi>Neſtorian</hi> Proſelyte Biſhops, enjoyning 'um to have it continually in their minds, and to teach it their People, as we may ſee in <hi>Raynaldus.</hi> In the profeſſion of Faith which <note place="margin">Raynaldus ad ann. 1445.</note>

                        <p>IN effect had the Emiſſaries and other travellers into theſe Countrys found the belief of the Subſtantial Converſion eſtabliſhed in them, 'tis not to be doubted but they would have proclaimed it to the World, and made this a Proof of the Antiquity of that Article. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would not have bin reduced to the Neceſſity of drawing a Proof from their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, ſeeing they would have poſitively declared they found theſe People
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41961:223"/> imbued with this ſentiment, that the ſubſtance of Bread is changed into the proper Subſtance of the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Popes would have loudly Gloryed in it, and certainly there would have bin ſome Body or other that would have taken Notice of the contradictions of the Proteſtants in <hi>Europe:</hi> but inſtead of this neither the Popes nor Emiſſaries make mention of this pretended conformity, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> Philoſophiſes upon their not charging the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> with their being <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and upon ſome paſſages of their Liturgies which are very uncertain, and which at bottom are of no conſideration in reſpect of our difference.</p>

                           <hi>LEONTIUS</hi> of <hi>Byzanejus</hi> recites a Diſcourſe concerning theſe <hi>Neſtorians</hi> from whence we may eaſily gather their Opinion touching the Bread of the Euchariſt. They were very earneſt (according to his Relation) <note place="margin">Leontius Biz. adverſ. Neſt. &amp; Eutych. Lib. 3. Bibl. patr. tom. 4.</note> with an Orthodox Chriſtian to communicate with them, and this Perſon telling them he could not have Communion at the ſame time with the Catholick Church and theirs, they anſwered him, <hi>that this need not trouble him becauſe the Bread which is propoſed as a Type of the Body of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>contains a greater bleſſing than that ſold in the market, or the Bread which the</hi> Philomarianites <hi>offered in the name of</hi> Mary. 'Tis appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently ſeen theſe are not the expreſſions of Perſons that believe the real Preſence which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church holds. This ſhews they acknowledged no other effect from the Conſecration than that of a Vertue of Benediction, or Grace, and 'tis alſo very Remarkable that in this Diſcourſe they do not give any other title to the Bread of the Sacrament than that of the Type of the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in which they follow the expreſſion of <note place="margin">

                           <hi>Neſtorius</hi> himſelf the Author of their Sect, who ſpeaking of the Bread of the Euchariſt ſay's, <hi>that the Body of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>is the Original of it,</hi> which is as much as to ſay that the Bread is a figure which repreſents this Body.

                        </p>
                        <p>AS to the <hi>Maronites</hi> their profeſſion of Obedience, ſince ſo long a time, to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> receiving their Patriarchs from the Pope, do's evidently exclude them from this diſpute. Yet we cannot but obſerve how little exact Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is, when deſigning to ſhew that the <hi>Maronites</hi> believed <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and the real Preſence even before their Reunion to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, ſay's, <hi>that</hi> Thomas a Jeſu <hi>mentions an extract made by the Popes Legats of the bad Propoſitions they found in the Books of the</hi> Maronites, <hi>amongst which they comprehend the different Ceremonys, ſuch as Comunicating of both kinds, giving the Communion to Children. Yet in this Catalogue of ſuſpected Propoſitions, there's not one relating to the Euchariſt.</hi> 'Tis certain Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is miſtaken, having peruſed this extract a little careleſly, for otherwiſe he would have obſerved three Propoſitions which evidently ſhew that theſe People did not believe <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> nor yet the Subſtantial Preſence. The firſt is, <hi>That our Saviour</hi> Chriſt <hi>dipt the Bread he gave to</hi> Judas, <hi>to 'the end he might thereby take off the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration.</hi> Chriſtus <hi>intinxit Panem quem erat</hi> Judae <hi>porrecturus ad Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crationem tollendam.</hi> We have already obſerved that this Errour muſt be grounded on this Principle, that the Bread is a Subject that receives Grace as a quality, which imprints its ſelf in its Subſtance, and which may be effaced in waſhing the Bread. For what likelyhood is there had they believed that the effect of the Conſecration was to change the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bread into that of the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that in dipping the Bread the Subſtance of the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> would be waſhed off?</p>

                        <p>THE II. Propoſition which the Legats expunged out of the <hi>Maronites</hi> Books was, <hi>That when we receive the Euchariſt, it Deſcends not into the Stomach, but immediately diſperſes it ſelf to every member of our Body.</hi> This Propoſition was deem'd Heretical, and in effect, we cannot believe that the matter of the Sacrament diſperſes its ſelf to all the Members of our Body without ſuppoſing it to be the Subſtance of Bread, there being too many abſurdities to make the proper Subſtance of <hi>Christs</hi> Body paſs into the Subſtance of our Fleſh. Yet this Sentiment is grounded on the Doctrine of <hi>Damaſcene</hi> who expreſly aſſerts, <hi>That the Sacrament paſſes</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Damaſcen. Lib. 4. de fide Orthodox. C. 14</note>

                           <hi>Bread paſſed into our Souls to become a part of them? Surely he will not proceed ſo far. How then will he conclude it enters into our Bodies to become a part of their Subſtance? And why do's he not conclude on the contrary, that as theſe words, in Conſiſtentiam animae vadit, do ſignify nothing elſe in reſpect of the Soul, but that the Body of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>unites its ſelf to the Soul, to conſerve, fortify and operate in it his Graces; ſo this expreſſion, in Conſiſtentiam Corporis vadit, do's ſignify nothing elſe, but that the Body of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>unites it ſelf to our Bodys to preſerve and ſow on them according to the Fathers the ſeeds of a Glorious immortality.</hi>

                        <p>BUT Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> deceives himſelf, not comprehending that according to <hi>Damaſcene</hi> and the <hi>Greeks,</hi> there are two things in the Euchariſt, the Subſtance, and the Spiritual and divine vertue, which is imparted to it by means of the Conſecration, ſo that <hi>Damaſcene</hi> making a diſtribution of theſe two things, attributes one of 'um to the Soul, to wit the Divine Vertue, and th'other to the Body, to wit the Subſtance, and 'tis in reſpect of this latter that he ſay's <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41961:224"/> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> without Prejudice or Paſſion but conſider a while the importance of this Propoſition. For whether theſe People pretended we muſt read the Text, not, <hi>this is my Body,</hi> but, <hi>this is the Sacrament of my Body,</hi> or meant only that this was the ſence we muſt give to the words of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the title of the Article inſinuates.

Was there ever a one of the <hi>Latins</hi> that ever had ſuch a thought in his mind, that we muſt not read, <hi>this is my Body, but this is the Sacrament of my Body?</hi> Do they not all on the contrary affirm that we muſt keep ſtrictly to the literal ſence? Let Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> conſult him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hereupon, and tell us whether he could offer ſuch a Propoſition and whether he would not eſteem it Scandalous and Heretical ſhould any other propoſe it.</p>
                        <p>YET muſt we obſerve that <hi>Thomas a Jeſu</hi> who recites the Extract which the Popes Legats made, ſay's expreſly that theſe Propoſitions which they found in proper terms in the Books of the <hi>Maronites,</hi> or received by the Publick Conſent, and by Tradition, and which they condemned as manifeſtly Heretical, or Erroneous, or Superſtitious, <hi>were Errors common to the other Eaſtern Nations,</hi> ſo that what we now Rehearſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Maronites</hi> muſt be extended in general to all the Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Churches.</p>
                        <p>AS to the paſſages related by <hi>Abraham Echellenſis</hi> a <hi>Maronite,</hi> who was of the Seminary at <hi>Rome,</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> muſt bear with me if I tell him, (that conſidering the Character which <hi>Gabriel Sionita</hi> gives us of this Perſon, whom he perfectly knew, being both of the ſame Country, and having paſſed over a great part of their Lifes together) he ought to be aſhamed to offer any thing grounded on theſe kind of Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and to ſuppoſe us ſuch Fools to give credit to the Relation of a Man ſo cryed down.</p>
                        <p>COME we now to the <hi>Jacobites, Copticks</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> brings again upon the Subject of theſe three Churches the ſame Negative Arguments drawn from the ſilence of Authors and Emiſſaries, which he uſed in reference to the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> and <hi>Neſtorians;</hi> ſo that we need do no more than to return the ſame anſwers already made, and tell him that, if theſe People had the ſame belief as the <hi>Roman</hi> Church touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Subſtance of the Sacrament, ſeveral Authors and Emiſſaries, would without doubt, have informed the World thereof; and make advantage of this conformity which they diſcovered between the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi> and them.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall tell him here again what he has bin told elſewhere that, when the Emiſſaries were ſent to theſe People to inſtruct them, they ever carried along with them the profeſſion of faith of <hi>Clement</hi> VI. which contained expreſſly the Article of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> that the Popes have ſent it to their Patriarchs and Proſelyte Biſhops; and that when <hi>Eugenius</hi> IV. <note place="margin">Raynald. ad. ann. 1442.</note> reunited to the <hi>Latin</hi> Church <hi>John</hi> the Patriarch of the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> he made him accept the decreee of the Reunion of the <hi>Armenians</hi> which contains in proper Terms the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>

                        <p>BUT after all we may tell him it cannot be ſuppoſed the <hi>Jacobites, Copticks</hi> or <hi>Ethiopians</hi> were conformable to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in the Doctrine of the Euchariſt, holding as they do, that there is but one Nature in our Saviour <hi>Chriſt</hi> which is the Divine, according to the Opinions of <hi>Eutiches</hi> and <hi>Dioſcorus.</hi> We cannot without charging them with the greateſt Abſurdity ſuppoſe they believe the Subſtance of Bread is really converted into the Subſtance of the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſeeing they hold that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> has not a Body, there being only the Divine Nature in him.

                           <hi>wills and operations the</hi> Aethiopians <hi>held to be in our Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>He anſwered that the</hi> Aethiopians <hi>profeſſed to believe only one Nature in</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>after the Union, one Will, and one Operation, yet without confuſion, and he added he knew well that the</hi> Aethiopians, Copticks <hi>and other Eaſtern Chriſtians that hold this Opinion deviated greatly from the truth. Being askt whether the</hi> Aethiopians <hi>believe one Nature in</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>reſulting from two. He anſwered that the</hi> Aethiopians <hi>do not ſay ſo, but profeſs to believe that there is only one Nature in our Saviour without mixture or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, which they affirm to be the Divine. Being moreover demanded whether the</hi> Aethiopians <hi>received the Decrees of the Council of</hi> Chalcedon. <hi>He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered they condemned this Council, becauſe therein was confirmed the two Natures in</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>and that therein was Condemned</hi> Dioſcorus <hi>the Patriarch of</hi> Alexandria. The Relations of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> confirm the ſame thing.</p>
                        <p>IT now concerns us to know whether all theſe Nations, to wit, the <hi>Jacobits, Copticks,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians</hi> can hold <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> that is to ſay, the queſtion is whether they be People indued with common ſence. For what can be more contradictory than to maintain on one hand that our Saviour <hi>Chriſt</hi> has no real Body, that there is nothing in him but the Divine Nature, that his whole converſe in the World, his Birth, Death and Reſurrection, were only bare Appearances without any Reality. And to believe on the other, that the Subſtance of Bread is really changed
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41961:225"/> into the proper Subſtance of his Body, into the ſame Subſtance he took of the Virgin, and which he retains ſtill in Heaven. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will tell us they hold <hi>Tranſubstantiation</hi> after their manner. But let him ſhew us then what this manner is. Will he have 'um believe the Subſtance of Bread is inwardly changed into the Subſtance of theſe Appearances with which they ſay the Divinity heretofore clothed it ſelf? Beſides that it would be ridiculous to attribute a Subſtance to ſimple Appearances which are nothing, and that according to them theſe appearances are no longer in being having ceaſed with the Oeconomy; will not this be excellent ſence to ſay that the Subſtance of Bread changes it ſelf into the Appearances which do not appear? for they will be concealed under the Vail of the Accidents of Bread, that is to ſay, they will be inviſible Appearances lying hid under other Appearances.</p>
                        <p>WILL Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> ſay they, hold the <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> of Bread into the Nature of the Divinity, which is to ſay that the Subſtance of Bread becomes it ſelf the Divine Eſſence? But if it be true that theſe People hold ſo monſtrous an Opinion, whence comes it that both Ancient and Modern Authors make no mention of it; never examined the Conſequences of ſuch a Converſion; have vehemently argued againſt the converſion of the Humane Nature into the Divine to ſhew that 'tis impoſſible, and not mentioned a word of this converſion of Bread into the Divinity? How happens it the Emiſſaries never diſcovered to the World ſo important a ſecret, never diſputed againſt them on this point, nor the Popes ever made them abjure ſuch an abſurd Opinion in the reunions made between theſe People and the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Whence comes it the <hi>Greeks</hi> who have bin mixtwith them, ſince ſo many ages never reproached 'um with this kind of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation</hi> about which there may be great Volumes written? Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> who is ſo ready at arguing from the ſilence of all theſe People, Authors, Travellers, Emiſſaries, Popes, <hi>Greeks, &amp;c.</hi> ought to inform us of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why not one of 'um has mentioned a word of this pretended change of Bread into the nature of the Divinity.</p>
                        <p>ALL this I think ſhould oblige Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to ſuſpend a while his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment touching Mr. <hi>Picquet</hi>'s Letter which ſay's, <hi>that all the</hi> Levantine <hi>Chriſtians, who are Hereticks, and conſequently ſuch as have entred into a Confederacy againſt the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, yet hold as an Article of Faith, the real Preſence of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>and</hi> Tranſubſtantiation <hi>of the Bread and Wine into the Body and Blood of our Lord.</hi> He ought at leaſt to deſire him <note place="margin">The Contents of this Letter are thus elated by Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> in his 12 Book.</note> to conſult what they mean in ſaying there is but one Nature in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and that the Divine one, and yet the Subſtance of Bread to be really chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Subſtance of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Body.</p>
                        <p>BUT this ought to oblige him likewiſe not to draw ſo lightly his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences from ſeveral Paſſages of the Liturgies which are attributed to theſe People, wherein the Euchariſt is called the Body and Blood of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> and ſaid to be truely this Body and this Blood. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that theſe Expreſſions import not <hi>Tranſubstantiation,</hi> as I have often proved, and ſhall farther prove in what follows, 'tis to be conſidered that we have no certainty that theſe pieces are real or faithfully Tranſlated, ſeeing that in thoſe few Paſſages which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> produces, there may be obſerved a Remarkable difference. The Liturgy which is in the <hi>Biblictheca Patrum</hi> under the Title of <hi>Canon generalis</hi> Aethiopum, mentions that the People ſay after the Prieſt has Conſecrated, <hi>Amen, Amen,</hi>

                              <hi>Mr.</hi> Arnaud Lib. 5. C. 13. p. 518.</note> 
                           <hi>O Domine Deus noſter, hoc eſt in veritate credimus caro tua. We believe thee, we truſt in thee, we praiſe thee O our God, this, we believe is thy Fleſh in truth.</hi> In one place the People are made to ſay they believe, <hi>that 'tis truely the Body of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, and here, <hi>that they believe 'tis the Body of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>in truth.</hi> Now there is a difference between theſe two Propoſitions, for in one the Adverb <hi>truely,</hi> refers to the Body, and in th'other to the Faith of the People. This alteration is not ſo inconſiderable but that we may ſee by this Example that thoſe who have given us this Liturgy which is in the <hi>Bibliotheca Patrum</hi> have not ſcrupled to accommodate their Tranſlation as much as in them lay to the ſence of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and to wreſt for this effect the Terms of the Original. I never ſay'd this whole Piece was abſolutely fictitious as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> wou'd make the World believe. But only that that paſſage which ſpeaks of the Elevation of the Hoſt is <note place="margin">Anſwer to the <hi>Perp. part. 2. C. 8. Lib 5. C. 13. p.</hi> 516.</note> 
                           <hi>a mere Forgery,</hi> and this we have proved by the Teſtimony of <hi>Alvarez</hi> and <hi>Zaga Zabo,</hi> one of which poſitively denies the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> elevate the Sacrament, and th'other declares they do not expoſe it. 'Tis to no purpoſe for Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to endeavour to juſtify this alteration in ſaying perhaps there be different Ceremonies in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> that they elevate the Sacrament in ſome places, and not in others, that they elevate it in a manner ſo little Remarkable that it has given Occaſion to <hi>Alvarez</hi> and <hi>Zaga Zabo</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it with the elevation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to ſay they elevated it not at all, that is, they do not elevate it ſo high as to make it be ſeen, as is uſual amongſt the <hi>Latins.</hi> 'Tis plainly ſeen theſe are mere Subterfuges and vain Conjectures: Had <hi>Alvarez</hi> and <hi>Zaga</hi> thus meant they would have ſo explain'd themſelves, and diſtinguiſhed the Places, or the manner of the Elevation, whereas they ſpeak abſolutely. Mr. <hi>Arnand</hi> do's not know more than theſe two Authors, and were he to correct or expound them he ought at leaſt to offer ſomething that might juſtify his Correction or Expoſition. We may confirm the Teſtimony of <hi>Alvarez</hi> and <hi>Zaga Zabo</hi> by that of <hi>Montconies</hi> a Traveller into thoſe parts, who deſcribing the Maſs of the <hi>Copticks,</hi> who, as every Body knows are of the ſame Religion, and obſerve the ſame Ceremonies as the <hi>Abyſſins,</hi> ſay's expreſly <hi>that they uſe no Elevation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IT is then certain that this Liturgy ſuch as it is in the <hi>Bibliotheca Patrum</hi> is an altered Piece, and therefore 'tis inſerted in it without any mention whence 'twas taken, or who Tranſlated it, as I already obſerved in my anſwer to the <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> Yet foraſmuch as the Almighty taketh the crafty in their own Nets, there are ſeveral things left untouch'd which do not well agree with the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> ſuch as for Inſtance is this Prayer which the Prieſt makes after the Conſecration, <hi>commemorating,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>thy Death, and Reſurrection, we offer thee this Bread and</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Miſſa ſive Canon uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſ. Aethiop. Bibl. patr. tom 6.</note> 
                           <hi>Cup, and give thee thanks inaſmuch as that by this Sacrifice thou haſt made us worthy to appear in thy Preſence, and exerciſe this office of Prieſthood before thee. Wee moſt earneſtly beſeech thee O Lord to ſend thy Holy Spirit on this Bread and Cup, which are the Body and Blood of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>our Lord and Saviour for ever.</hi> Did they underſtand the Bread and Wine were the Body and Blood of the Son of God in proper Subſtance, would they ſay to him himſelf that they offer to him the Bread and Cup in Commemoration of his Death
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41961:226"/> and Reſurrection, and would it not likewiſe be impious to deſire him to ſend on this Bread and Cup his Holy Spirit? 'Tis not to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf that the <hi>Latins</hi> do offer his Body and Blood; thoſe that believe the <hi>Roman</hi> reality do not expreſs themſelves in ſuch a manner, much leſs can they deſire of him to ſend down his Holy Spirit on them; for as ſoon as ever 'tis conceived to be the proper Body and Blood of our Lord in the ſence wherein the <hi>Latins</hi> underſtand it, 'tis believed there is a fulneſs of the Holy Spirit in them.</p>
                        <p>I cannot but here relate what Mr. <hi>Faucheur</hi> has obſerved touching the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Liturgy commonly called St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s, by which will appear that the complaints we make concerning theſe pieces are not without cauſe. <hi>The</hi> Egyptian <hi>Liturgy,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>attributed to St.</hi> Gregory <hi>imports, I offer to thee O Lord</hi> the SYMBOLS OF MY RANSOM. <hi>For</hi>

                        <p>BUT beſides this way of corrupting the Liturgies by falſe Tranſlations, it is moreover true that, when theſe <hi>Levantine</hi> Chriſtians were Reunited as they often have bin with the <hi>Latins,</hi> the <hi>Latins</hi> never fail'd to examine their Books, and take out of 'um whatſoever they found therein contrary to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for example, there has bin inſerted in the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliotheca Patrum</hi> the Liturgy of the <hi>Neſtorian</hi> Chriſtians of <hi>Mallabar,</hi> but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this title <hi>corrected and cleanſed from the Errors and Blaſphemies of the</hi> Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, <hi>by the Illuſtrious and Reverend My Lord</hi> Alexius Menenſes <hi>Arch-Biſhop of</hi>

                        <p>THERE's all the likelyhood in the World that this Clauſe which appears in the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Liturgies of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and <hi>Gregory,</hi> of <hi>Victor Schialch</hi>'s Tranſlation, and from which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> pretends to make advantage, is an Addition made thereunto by the <hi>Latins,</hi> in ſome one of theſe Reunions; for if we examine it well we ſhall eaſily find that 'tis a confeſſion of the reality of the Humane Nature in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which is a confeſſion directly oppoſite to the Error of the <hi>Copticks</hi> who only acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Divine Nature.</p>

I make the pure confeſſion which he made before</hi> Pontius Pilate, <hi>he gave his Body for us on the Croſs by his own will. He has really aſſumed this Body for us. I believe that the Humanity was never ſeperate from the Divinity, no not a Moment, and that he gave his Body to purchaſe Salvation, Remiſſion of Sins</hi>

                           <hi>and eternal life for all thoſe that ſhall believe in him.</hi> There needs no great ſtudy to find that the deſign of this whole Prayer is to confeſs the Truth of the Myſtery of the Incarnation, and the reality of the Humane Nature in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and that theſe words, <hi>without converſion, mixture or confuſion,</hi> are preciſely thoſe which have bin ever oppoſed againſt the Hereſy of the <hi>Eutichiens</hi> with which the <hi>Copticks</hi> are tainted. Whereupon we cannot doubt but that this is an addition of the <hi>Latins,</hi> who in reuniting theſe People to themſelves have inſerted in their very Liturgy, ſeveral Clauſes expreſly contrary to their old Error, that they might the more abſolutely bring them off from it.</p>
                        <p>LET not Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> then any longer glory in theſe Eaſtern Liturgies, for if we had 'um pure and ſincere, I do not queſtion but we ſhould find ſeveral things in 'um that do not well agree with the Belief of the Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Preſence, nor with that of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> Neither has he reaſon to brag of the general Conſent of all the Churches call'd Schiſmatical, with which pretence he would dazle the Eyes of the World. Upon a thro conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of what we have ſo farrepreſented to him whether in reſpect of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or other Chriſtian Churches, he muſt acknowledge he has over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot himſelf, and bin too raſh in his Affirmations on this Subject. Which I believe I have evidently diſcover'd, and in ſuch a manner as nothing can be alledged againſt it. I dare aſſure him he will find in this diſpute no Sophiſms on my part. Having proceeded faithfully and ſincerely in it. I have taken things as they lye in their Natural order. I have offered nothing but upon good grounds, from Teſtimonies for the moſt part taken out of Authors that are <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks. I have never taken Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s words (as I know of) in any other ſence than in that wherein he meant them. I have followed him ſtep by ſtep as far as good order would permit me. I have exactly anſwered him without weakning his Arguments, or Proofs, or paſſing by any thing conſiderable. In fine, I have not offered any thing but what I my ſelf before was convinced and perſwaded to be true, and I am much miſtaken if I have not reduced matters to that clearneſs that others will be no leſs perſwaded of what I ſay than my ſelf.</p>

                           <p>Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s <hi>8<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>
                              </hi> Book touching the Sentiment of the <hi>Latins</hi> on the Mystery of the Eucharist ſince the year 700. till <hi>Paſchaſius</hi>'s time, examined.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THE order of the diſpute requires, that having refuted as I have done the pretended Conſent of all the Eaſtern Churches with the <hi>Latin</hi> in the Doctrines of the Subſtantial Preſence and <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> I ſhould now apply my ſelf to the examination of what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> alledges touching the <hi>Latins</hi> themſelves from the 7<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Century till <hi>Paſchaſius</hi>'s time excluſively, that is to ſay, till towards the beginning of the Ninth. And this is the deſign of the greateſt part of his 8<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Book; and which ſhall be the greateſt part of this of mine.</p>
                        <p>BUT not to amuſe the Reader with fruitleſs matters, 'tis neceſſary to lay aſide the firſt of his Proofs, which is only a Conſequence drawn from the belief of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church with which the <hi>Latin</hi> remain'd United during thoſe Centuries, whence Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would infer that the <hi>Latin</hi> Church has believed <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and the real Preſence ſeeing the <hi>Greek</hi> Church has held theſe Doctrines as he pretends to have proved. We may reply in general that there can be nothing of ſolidity or certainty concluded from either of theſe Churches, whether we conſider them ſince their ſeparation, or during their Reunion. The <hi>Latins</hi> believed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son, and they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the <hi>filioque</hi> to the Symbol long before the Separation of <hi>Photius,</hi> and yet the Churches continued United without diſputing on theſe Articles, as they did afterwards. 'Tis the ſame in reference to ſeveral other points, and had not the intereſt as well of the Popes as of <hi>Photius</hi> bin concerned in this affair, 'tis likely both of 'um had continued a long time in the ſame ſtate of communion together notwithſtanding all theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. 'Tis then a mere abuſe to eſtabliſh the Doctrine of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church by that of the <hi>Greek</hi> one, or that of the <hi>Greek</hi> one by that of the <hi>Latin,</hi> whatſoever Union there might have bin betwixt them. He that would be certain of their ſentiments muſt conſider each of 'um apart, and ſearch for the belief of the Weſtern Church in the Weſt, and that of the Eaſtern in the Eaſt. Not but that I believe the <hi>Latins</hi> as well as the <hi>Greeks</hi> knew nothing of theſe admirable Doctrines of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> or the Subſtantial Preſence in the Ages now in queſtion; but becauſe I cannot ſee how there can be reaſonably drawn a Conſequence from the one to the other. And yet ſuppoſing the Conſequence were good, it cannot but be in my favour, having ſhewed ſo clearly as I have done that the <hi>Greeks</hi> have not the ſame belief touching the Sacrament as the <hi>Roman</hi> Church has at this Day.</p>
                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:41961:228"/>
                        <p>LET us lay aſide for this time the <hi>Greeks,</hi> ſeeing we have diſcourſed ſufficiently on them, and come we to the <hi>Latins</hi> themſelves. <hi>I will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 8. Ch. 1. pag, 736.</note> ſay's Mr. <hi>Arnaud, poſitively to ſhew from Authors of theſe Centuries, that the Body of the</hi> Latin <hi>Church has had no other Faith touching this Myſtery than that of the real Preſence, and Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> I confeſs the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking is conſiderable and worth Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s pains, but we muſt ſee how he acquits himſelf therein. For this purpoſe he has a long Chapter of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives whoſe title is, ſuppoſing the real Preſence and <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> were conſtantly and univerſally believed during the ſeventh, eigth and ninth Century, how men ought to ſpeak of the Myſtery of the Euchariſt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Reaſon and Nature, and the ordinary way of their expreſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. This Chapter is full of long diſcourſes, whoſe drift is to perſwade us that provided we ſuppoſe the <hi>Latin</hi> Church firmly believed <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,</hi> there being then no diſpute about this Article we ſhall not be offended at ſeveral expreſſions arſing from Sence which cauſed the Euchariſt to be called Bread and Wine, the Subſtance of Bread and Wine, that it would be even contrary to Nature not to find in the Writings of theſe Ages any Traces of this Language of ſenſe, and that a too great care to avoid it, would not at all agree with the ſtate of thoſe times. Moreover all which can be expected is that the Writers of thoſe times have explain'd themſelves in terms which plainly and naturally denote the Faith of this Myſtery, and imprint the <hi>idea</hi> of it in the minds of all thoſe which hear them litterally. That the firm belief which they had of the <hi>Reality</hi> ſhould only have hindred them from ever propoſing any of the Opinions of the Sacramentaries. That as to the doubts which ariſe from this Myſtery they have not wholly diſſembled them, but endeavoured to ſatisfie 'um after a prudent manner, in ſaying the Euchariſt is truely and properly the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> That this expreſſion explains and determines the ſimple expreſſions which affirm the Euchariſt to be the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> That they abridged their words and left ſomething to be ſupplyed by the minds of thoſe they ſpake to. That the Myſtery of the Euchariſt being compoſed of two parts, th'one viſible and th'other inviſible, th'one ſenſible, and th'other intelligible, that is to ſay, of the outward vail which is the Sacrament, and of the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> covered with this vail, it may be conſidered in three manners. The firſt is to reſpect it directly, and the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly. The ſecond is to reſpect directly the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the Sacrament indirectly. And the third is to conſider equally the Sacrament and the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> That from theſe three ways of conſidering this Myſtery there ariſe ſeveral different expreſſions; for according to the firſt it may be call'd the Sacrament of the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Myſtery of the Body of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> the Figure of the Body; and according to the ſecond be ſaid that the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is contained in the Myſtery, in the Sacrament, under the Figure of Bread and Wine, and according to the third that the Euchariſt is both the Reality and the Figure. That 'tis Natural for a mans mind to apply it ſelf to one of theſe particulars without denying the other. In fine, that as this Myſtery comprehends ſeveral Relations, Cuſtoms, Benefits, and Senſes which are ingraved and repreſented in the Symbols, it muſt needs be very common with Authors of thoſe times to apply themſelves to the ſhewing the faithful theſe myſterious Significations, without concerning themſelves about the explanation of the eſſential part of the myſtery ſeeing 'twas known of all the World.</p>
                        <pb n="63" facs="tcp:41961:228"/>
                        <p>AND this is the ſum of this confuſed heap of Arguments with which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has ſtuft the Second Chapter of his 8th Book. 'Tis evident he deſign'd by theſe Circuits propofed with ſuch a prodigious Perplexity of Words, to throw himſelf into a Labyrinth, and draw inſenſibly his Readers after him. For to what end is this heap of Suppoſitions, Propoſitions, Reflections, Diſtinctions, different Reſpects, Ways of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion &amp;c. with which this Chapter is crammed? Is <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> ſo deep ſunk into the 7th and following Centuries, that we cannot get at it unleſs we paſs thro as many Turnings and Windings, as there were Porches and Doors in the Ancient Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> before a man could come to the Sanctuary? Methinks this alone is ſufficient to prejudice ones Mind againſt Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Cauſe; for had the <hi>Latin</hi> Church then believed the Converſion of the Subſtances, would ſhe not have clearly explain'd her ſelf? ſhould we not have ſeen it appear in the Expreſſions of its Doctors, without giving a mans ſelf all this trouble to find it?</p>
                        <p>MOREOVER how can Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> deſire a man, before he judges of his Reaſonings, and the Expreſſions of Authors in queſtion, to ſuppoſe the Church then believed <hi>conſtantly and univerſally</hi> the real Preſence and <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> altho ſhe never had ſeen any Controverſy to ariſe touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Articles? Is it fitting for thoſe who are to decide a Queſtion to prepoſſeſs themſelves with Prejudices by Suppoſitions which do in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves determine the Difference, or which at leaſt muſt byaſs a mans Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment towards thoſe things which are afterwards offered? If I for my ſhare deſired a man to ſuppoſe a Church which never heard any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Subſtantial Preſence, nor Converſion of Subſtances; that never believed theſe Doctrines, and were ignorant of all the Subtilties of the Schools on that point, my requeſt would be more reaſonable than that of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s: for till we are ſhew'd <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> has bin receiv'd in a Church, we may ſuppoſe this Church in a ſtate of Nature in this reſpect. Now we know 'tis contrary to Nature to believe it. I know Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would not fail to tell me we muſt not thus fill mens Minds with Prejudices, but leave 'um at liberty to judge of things alledged on both ſides. This Suppoſition then which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would have us make is captious, far from being ſincere, and tending to ſurprize mens minds, by making 'um take a part beforehand, without any ground or reaſon, that being thus prejudic'd, they may ſee what is not, and not ſee what is. For it is certain according to theſe two different Suppoſitions, the one, that a Church believed <hi>Tranſubstantiation,</hi> but never diſputed about it. Th'other that a Church did not believe <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> nor ever heard it, a man ſhall differently judge of the ſame Expreſſions. Upon one of theſe Prejudices a man will ſay, here's one of theſe defective Expreſſions men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd by Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> which leaves ſomething to be ſupplyed by the Hearer; and on the other, a man will ſay, here's an Expreſſion which comprehends the whole Faith of the Myſtery. In effect, hence proceed the different Judgments which the Catholicks and Proteſtants make on ſeveral Paſſages of the ancient Fathers, the one, believe they ſee <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation</hi> in 'um, becauſe they read the Paſſages with this Prejudice, that the ancient Church held it, and the places conſidered in this reſpect confirm them in the thoughts which they have already entertain'd; the others do not find it in 'um, becauſe they conſider the ſame Paſſages with this contrary Prejudice, that the ancient Church did not believe it, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41961:229"/> theſe Paſſages conſidered in this regard make no Impreſſion upon them. On the other hand there are Paſſages which appear very conſiderable for the Proteſtants againſt the Converſion of Subſtances, and which yet appear but weak and inconſiderable to the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks.</p>
                        <p>TO deal fairly in a matter of this Importance, it ſeems to me a man ought to compare theſe two Prejudices one with the other, and examine ſolidly which of the two is moſt juſt and reaſonable. For this effect we muſt conſider the Church, either as a Society of men, or as a Society of Chriſtians. In the firſt reſpect it will be the greateſt Abſurdity imaginable to attribute to it the belief of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> If ſhe held it, it would be in the ſecond reſpect, I would ſay inaſmuch as ſhe is a Chriſtian Society that has ſuch Articles of Divine Faith, and particular Sentiments touching Religion which Nature do's not give. Now in this quality a man cannot reaſonably prejudicate that the Church of the 7th. and following Centuries believed the Subſtantial Preſence and <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> but by one of theſe two motives, either becauſe he ſees theſe Doctrines contain'd in the firſt and fundamental Rule of Chriſtian Religion, which is the Word of God, or ſees 'um already eſtabliſhed in the preceding Centuries. If then Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would eſtabliſh his Suppoſition, he muſt begin by Inquiries into the Scriptures, and Tradition of the firſt Six Centuries, and ſhew therein the Doctrines in queſtion; which done, he ſhould deſcend to the Seventh and Eighth Ages, and make his Diſcuſſion on this Principle, that the Church at that time was in Poſſeſſion of believing the real Preſence and <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation.</hi> But he do's neither the one nor the other of theſe things. He begins his Diſcuſſion from the Seventh Century, and would have his Reader Judge beforehand from thence that the Church at that time held the Doctrines now in diſpute. This is a plain Deviation and Illuſion. For till ſuch time as the contrary appears to us, we muſt always prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine on Natures ſide. Now the order of Nature is neither to believe the Subſtantial Preſence, nor the Converſion of the Subſtance of Bread, ſo that unleſs the eſtabliſhment of theſe Doctrines in the Church appears elſewhere, we cannot but ſuppoſe the Church, in what time and place ſoever we conſider it, in a State purely Natural in this reſpect.</p>
                        <p>WEE can never, reaſonably predetermine, without ſome conſiderable motive, contrary to that common Light which regulates the judgments of men, nor contrary to Univerſal Notions, and general Cuſtoms. Now 'tis certain that theſe three things oppoſe the Doctrines in queſtion. For our Senſes give in their Teſtimony againſt them, and Reaſon carry us rather away from 'um than to 'um. Univerſal Notions give us quite different <hi>idea</hi>'s than thoſe which theſe Doctrines conſtrain us to have, and the common Cuſtom is to judge of ſenſible things according to their Natural Characters.</p>
                        <p>WEE ought never to prejudicate, without exceeding great reaſon, againſt an example, I mean againſt the uſual manner of proceeding, acting, thinking, or ſpeaking, in ſuch like matters as is this in queſtion. Now the Example of all People and eſpecially of Chriſtians ſhews, they conceive the Myſteries or Sacraments, without imagining any Converſion of Subſtance in 'um, that they give to ſigns the names of the things which they repreſent, to diſtinguiſh Myſteries from Miracles properly ſo called,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41961:229"/> not to offer Miracles wrought on ſenſible things, and which are yet not only imperceptible to the Senſes, but alſo contrary to their Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the Queſtion concerns a particular Doctrine which goes to the making up of a part of the Body of a Religion, a man ought never to prejudicate lightly againſt that which we call the Analogy, that is to ſay, the Relation, Coherence and juſt Proportion which ought to be Naturally between the Doctrines, Maxims, and Cuſtoms of the ſame Religion. For 'tis with Religion as with the ſeveral Parts of a Building, or Aedifices of the ſame City, or Members of the ſame Body, or if you will, as with Children of the ſame Family. They are known by one another, becauſe they all do in ſome ſort reſemble each other; now if we conſider the Chriſtian Religion in the State wherein it was in the Seventh and Eighth Centuries, we ſhall find it full of Explications and Myſtical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; for this is the true Character of the Divinity of thoſe Days. We ſhall find perpetual Diſcourſes of that Spiritual Communion which we have with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and immediate Manducation of his fleſh as an Act of the Soul, and of a thing that belongs only to the Faithful. We ſhall not find they conſidered any more than two States in our Saviour <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to wit, that of his Abaſement, and that of his Exaltation, without ever mentioning this third State call'd Sacramental.</p>
                        <p>WE ſhall not find 'um applying to the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, ſeveral Paſſages of the Old Teſtament, which might be eaſily made to point at it, and which ſeveral Doctors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church at this day do in effect make to relate unto <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> It will not be found they have taken ſeveral Terms in the Sence wherein they muſt be taken upon the Suppoſition of <hi>Species;</hi> for Accidents without a Subject, of <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually</hi> to denote an Exiſtence after the manner of a Spirit, of the Vail of the Sacrament or Figure of Bread to ſignifie a bare Appearance of Bread that covers the Subſtance of the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> of <hi>Corporeal Preſence,</hi> for a Preſence after the manner of a Body, by Oppoſition to the Preſence of this ſame Body after the manner of a Spirit. It is plainly ſeen they have forced and exaggerated the Expreſſions of the Scripture on the Subject of Baptiſm, the Church, the Poor, the Goſpel, at leaſt as vehem ently as thoſe that are to be met with in the Scripture touching the Euchariſt. We ſhall not find they have made on the Subject of the Sacrament either the Diſtinctions, Obſervations or Queſtions, which Perſons prepoſſeſſed with the belief of the Converſion of Subſtances ought neceſſarily to have made, without being obliged thereunto by Diſputes. Nor, in a word, the proper and inſeparable Conſequences of this Doctrine, but on the contrary ſeveral things exactly contrary to it. Now this is what I call Analogy or Relation which the parts of a Religion have with one another, and againſt which I ſay 'tis not Rational to prejudicate.</p>
                        <p>'TIS certain we ought not only not to prejudicate againſt all theſe things, but on the contrary predetermine in their favour, ſeeing the prejudice which all theſe things form is ſo ſtrong that we muſt have on the other ſide a very great Evidence to ſurmount it. Eſpecially if we examine the Centuries that preceded the ſeventh, whereunto likewiſe may be applied the ſame Obſervations which I now made, whence ariſe the like Prejudices in reſpect of thoſe Ages, and this Pejudice joyning it
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41961:230"/> ſelf to that which we have eſtabliſhed touching the Seventh and Eighth Centuries do only fortify it yet more.</p>
                        <p>TO all which we may add that there is, to ſpeak morally, a kind of Contradiction between the parts of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Suppoſition. He would have us imagine the Church of the Seventh and following Ages firmly believed the real Preſence and Converſion of Subſtances, altho theſe Doctrines were never diſputed of therein, nor ſo much as queſtioned. But 'tis very improbable the Church remain'd Seven or Eight hundred years with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Conteſt touching this Article, ſuppoſing ſhe held it. There have bin in this Interval of time ſeveral Controverſies touching the principal Points of the Chriſtian Religion, on Articles againſt which Nature do's leſs riſe than againſt that of which we ſpeak, and which moreover are found clearly eſtabliſhed in the Word of God. How comes it to paſs there has bin none on this? There have bin even ſeveral Diſputes in which there has bin occaſion of mentioning the Doctrines of the real Preſence and <hi>Tranſubstantiation,</hi> which could not be without ſome Conteſt on this Subject. Such were the Controverſies of the <hi>Valentinians, Marcionites, Manichees, Millenaries, Encratites, Arians, Originiſts, Eutychiens, Aſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupites,</hi> and of I know not how many others, which muſt una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably produce Debates on the Euchariſt had the Belief which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church has at this day bin then introduced into Chriſtianity. It being then certain as it is, that the Church was in peace in this reſpect during all theſe Centuries, 'tis a token that the Doctrines in queſtion were therein unknown, and this very Conſideration overthrows Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Prejudice, and confirms ours.</p>
                        <p>MR. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will ſay, without doubt, we muſt ſuppoſe the Church of the ſeventh and eighth Centuries to be in the ſame Condition wherein lay that of the eleventh, which condemned the Doctrine of <hi>Berenger.</hi> But beſides, that there are ſeveral things which may be alledged concerning this Condemnation, it not being true then men believed <hi>constantly</hi> and <hi>univerſally Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> nor the real Preſence, as may be juſtified by ſeveral Inductions, there being no likelyhood in the firſt Condemnations of <hi>Berenger, Tranſubſtantiation</hi> was eſtabliſhed, ſeeing 'twas eſtabliſhed in the Council of <hi>Rome</hi> held under <hi>Nicolas</hi> II. wherein he was condemned for the fifth time, according to the Authors of the Office of the Holy Sacrament, as we have already obſerved; 'tis an apparent Illuſion to deſign the grounding of any Prejudication on this, ſeeing we find in the ninth Century a formal Conteſt which aroſe on this Subject; and that even this makes the principal Point of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> Difference, to wit, whether there has hapned any change therein. Before then the Condition of the eleventh Century can be made to ſerve for a Principle to conclude from thence the Condition of the ſeventh and eigth, the Queſtion concerning the Change muſt be firſt decided, for whilſt we be in this Conteſt, there can be no Conſequence drawn hence. It would be a very pleaſant thing for a man to prejudicate againſt the Change which we pretend, by the ſeventh and eighth Century as believing <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and at the ſame time to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicate for <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> in the ſeventh and eighth Centuries, becauſe 'twas believed in the eleventh, which is to ſay, to draw the Principle from the Concluſion, and then the Concluſion from the Principle, in ſaying on one hand that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> was believed in the eleventh Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, becauſe 'twas believed in the Seventh and in the Eigth, and on
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41961:230"/> the other that 'twas believed in the ſeventh and in the eighth, becauſe 'twas believed in the Eleventh.</p>
                        <p>LET Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> then if he pleaſes make another Syſtem, for all this great preparation of Obſervations and Propoſitious falls to the ground aſſoon as ever we deny him the Suppoſition he made, and ſhewed him the injuſtice and unreaſonableneſs of it. As to this pretended contrariety of the Language of Sence with that of Faith, 'tis a thing we have already confuted. Should our Senſes take upon 'um to tell us the Euchariſt was only Bread and Wine, or mere Bread and Wine, our Faith would not bear this Language. This is not the Language of the Church. But when our Senſes only tell us 'tis Bread and Wine, this Language is in truth different from that of Faith, which tells us 'tis the Body of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> but 'tis not contrary to it; for Faith receives and approves it in the manner wherein the Senſes conceive it, which is to ſay, 'tis real Bread and real Wine in a litteral ſence, and without a figure. <hi>That which you have ſeen on the Altar,</hi> ſay's St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> and after him <hi>Bede</hi> an Author of the eighth Contury <hi>is Bread and</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Auguſ. ſerm. ad Infunt.</note> 
                           <hi>Wine, and this your Eyes tell you, but the inſtruction which your Faith requires is, that the Bread is the Body of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>and the Cup his Blood.</hi> So that here, we have the two Languages both of Senſe and of Faith, but that of Faith do's not contradict that of Senſe, on the contrary Faith receives the Language of Senſe without Explication and Figure. For whoſoever ſay's the Euchariſt is <hi>Bread and Wine, which our Eyes likewiſe ſhew us,</hi> means 'tis real Bread and Wine in Subſtance, for this our Eyes ſhew us in a moſt proper and litteral ſenſe. If St. <hi>Augustin</hi> and <hi>Bede</hi> find ſome Appearance of contrariety between the Language of Senſe, which bears 'tis Bread, and that of Faith which will have this Bread to be the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the difficulty lyes not in the Teſtimony of Senſe, as if we need call its truth in queſtion, but in the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which being Fleſh aſſumed of the Virgin, which ſuffered the Death of the Croſs, and was exalted up into Heaven, that Bread ſhould be ſay'd to be this Body. <hi>This thought may ariſe,</hi> ſay's St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and <hi>Bede</hi> after him, <hi>in the mind of ſome Perſons, we know whence our Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>has taken his Fleſh, to wit, of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>we know he was ſuckled in his Infancy, educated, grew up in years, ſuffered the Perſecution of the</hi> Jews, <hi>was nayl'd to the Croſs, put to Death, Buried, roſe the third Day, and Aſcended into Heaven when he pleaſed, whence he is to Deſcend to judge both the living and dead, and that he is now ſat down at the right hand of the Father. How then is the Bread his Body, and the Cup his Blood?</hi> They do not ſay, how ſhall we not believe what our Senſes aſſure us? Shall we doubt of the truth of their Teſtimony? On the contrary they ſuppoſe this Teſtimony to be certain, and ground the difficulty on the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> which cannot be Bread. The Explication of the difficulty and the reconciliation of the two Propoſitions are not built on the Error of the ſenſes, nor the Interpretation which ought be given to their Language, in ſaying the Euchariſt is called Bread becauſe it appears to be ſo, or becauſe 'twas Bread before its Conſecration. But from the Nature of the Sacraments, wherein there are two <hi>Ideas</hi> both of 'um true, the one of our Senſes, and the other of our Underſtanding. <hi>My Brethren,</hi> ſay they, <hi>theſe things are called Sacraments becauſe we ſee therein one thing, and underſtand ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. That which we ſee, has a Corporeal Species, that which we underſtand, has a Spiritual Fruit.</hi> As if they had ſay'd, as to what concerns our Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight 'tis really Bread and Wine, but in reſpect of our Underſtanding 'tis
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41961:231"/> the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> So that if there muſt be any thing figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in either of the two Propoſitions, it muſt be in the Language of Faith, and not in that of Senſe, which bears neither Difficulty nor Expoſition.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>ALL that we can expect from them,</hi> ſay's Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> (that is to ſay, from Authors of the ſeventh and eighth Century,) <hi>is that, when they ſpeak of this Myſtery according to Faith and Truth, they ſhould explain themſelves</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 8. Ch. 2. p. 739.</note> 
                           <hi>according to thoſe Terms which plainly and naturally expreſs it, and which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print the</hi> Idea <hi>of it in all thoſe which hear them litterally.</hi> That which may be expected from Perſons believing and teaching the Converſion of the Subſtance of Bread, whether it has bin diſputed on or no, is, that they declare it in preciſe and formal Terms. Which I have already ſhew'd on the Subject of the <hi>Greeks</hi> by this reaſon, that the Doctrine of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Subſtances determins the general Sence of theſe Expreſſions, the Bread is made the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Bread is changed into the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that it gives them a particular Senſe, and forms of it ſelf a diſtinct, and preciſe <hi>Idea;</hi> whence it follows that when the queſtion is about teaching of it, and a man has directly this Intention, he cannot but expreſs it in clear and plain Terms, which anſwer the <hi>Idea</hi> he has of it, and makes thence the ſame to ſpring up in the Minds of the Hearers. It cannot be denyed but this Converſion, and Subſtantial Preſence are of themſelves very difficult to be conceived and hard to be believed, becauſe all the lights of Nature are contrary to 'um, and there is nothing convictive in Holy Scripture to eſtabliſh 'um. How then can a man conceive that a Church which holds 'um, or deſigns to Preach 'um to its People, do's not explain it ſelf about 'um at leaſt in preciſe and formal Expreſſions? Reaſon forces us to ſay ſhe ought to endeavor to eſtabliſh them by the ſtrongeſt Proofs ſhe was able; for ſuppoſing the Schools had never diſputed concerning 'um, and no Perſon had ever declared againſt 'um, yet Nature itſelf which is common to all men, do's ſufficiently enough oppoſe them to oblige the Church, he ſpeaks of, to defend them from their Attacks, and fortify them againſt their Oppoſitions. But granting Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> the Authors of the ſeventh and eighth Centuries were in this reſpect extremely negligent; who can imagine they really intended to teach the Subſtance of Bread was really converted into the Subſtance of the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> when they expreſs themſelves only by general and ambiguous Terms which need ſo many Commentaries and Supplements?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>BUT,</hi> ſay's Mr. <hi>Arnaud, we have reaſon to believe that being Men and indued with Humane Inclinations, they had that alſo of abridging their</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ch. 2. p. 742.</note> 
                           <hi>Words, and leaving ſomething to be ſupplyed by them to whom they ſpake.</hi> I know ſeveral People of a contrary Humour, and yet are men, as appears by other Humours they have. But this Propoſition has no other foundation but Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Imagination. He offers it without any Proof, and I may reject it without farther examining it. Yet let me tell him that in the Explication of Myſteries of Religion, Men are not wont to uſe theſe half Sentences, unleſs when they treat of a Point indirectly and occaſionally, and not when they expreſly and deſignedly fall upon the explaining of what we muſt know and believe. What ſtrange kind of ways then had they in thoſe Times, to expreſs themſelves only in half Sentences, when they deſign'd to explain the Myſtery of the Euchariſt? This Cuſtom laſted a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41961:231"/> great while, ſeeing it was ſo for near two hundred years; and who told Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> the Miniſters were not now and then tempted to aſſert things clearly and ſpeak what they thought, or at leaſt that the People were not wearyed with continual ſupplying what was wanting in the Expreſſions of their Miniſters, or in fine that none of theſe Cuſtoms were loſt? Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> complains we make uſe of Raillery ſometimes to refute him, but why do's he not then tell us things leſs ridiculous? For to ſpeak ſoberly, to undertake to prove <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and the real Preſence by the ſilence of him that teaches on one ſide, and by the Suppliment of him that hearkens on the other is not very rational. Yet to this paſs may be reduced his manner of arguing ſhould his Maxim take place, the Fathers of the ſeventh and eigth Centuries have ſay'd ſuch and ſuch a thing with Reticency. Now the People have underſtood them in ſuch and ſuch a manner by a ſupplement. Therefore they taught and believed the real Preſence and <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> How can a man conſider this ſeriouſly? Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will tell us there's nothing more common in Humane Speech than to uſe half Sentences; nor any thing more uſual than to ſupply what is wanting to 'um. We are wont to ſay, a Man, a Houſe, a City, the Air, the Earth, the Sun, and not the Subſtance of a Man, the Subſtance of a Houſe, &amp;c. But here is a great deal of difference. For here we uſe theſe Expreſſions becauſe we ſuppoſe thoſe to whom we ſpeak have eyes and the uſe of their reaſon, and that theſe eaſily ſupply what is wanting in words. Nay when we uſe theſe terms even in a figurative ſenſe, we do not explain them, becauſe we know that ſenſe and reaſon which are common lights to thoſe that ſpeak, and hear, will ſufficiently explain them. But 'tis not the ſame in reference to the Euchariſt, for ſuppoſing there's made in it a real Converſion of the inward Subſtance of the Bread into the inward Subſtance of the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Senſe and Reaſon lead us not to underſtand this Change, ſeeing 'tis imperceptible, and contrary to the order of Nature; and we cannot ſupply by their means what is imperfect in the Words. Neither can this Suppliment come from the Word of God, for it is pretended theſe terms which our Saviour uſed in the inſtitution of the Sacrament have themſelves need of being explained and determined by that which is called the ſence of the Church. Neither can it come from the Tradition of the preceding Ages, for beſides that the People have little knowledge of this Tradition, we ſhall not find any thing more preciſe in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of the firſt Six Ages, than in thoſe of the ſeventh and eighth. Whence then muſt this Suppliment come? Muſt we here ſuppoſe ſecret and immediate Inſpirations, or imagine there were certain ſhort forms of ſpeech then in uſe, and which ſerved as a key for the underſtanding of the Publick teachings? Unleſs 'twere ſo I cannot ſee how Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Syſtem can hold. For to ſay that by a Prophetick Spirit they of the ſeventh and eighth Centuries knew what would be determin'd in the eleventh, and ſupplyed what was wanting by means of this Preſcience, this is ſomething hard to be believed, and I know not whether Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is willing to go ſo far; 'tis then clear that this pretended Suppliment is a mere Whimſy, and as ill contrived and maintained as ever any thing was.</p>
                        <p>AS to thoſe two parts which compoſe the Myſtery of the Euchariſt, the one the external Vail which is the Sacrament, and th'other the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> which is covered with this Vail, this is not a place for a
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41961:232"/> thro-examination of this Hypotheſis. Yet methinks Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> advances ſomething ſingular enough when he adds, <hi>that 'tis fruitleſs to enquire into the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Chap. 2. pag. 743.</note> 
                           <hi>Nature of this vail, it being ſufficient to know that it is Bread and Wine according to Appearance,</hi> which is to ſay, if I be not miſtaken, that 'tis needleſs to enquire whether this Appearance of Bread which covers the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is a mere Phantaſm, a pure Illuſion which our Senſes ſuffer, or whether they be really the Accidents of Bread which ſubſiſt ſeparate from their Subſtance. Let the Gentlemen of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church determine whether this Doctrine be according to their Councils, eſpecially that of <hi>Conſtance.</hi> As to my part I ſhall only tell Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> he will not find this Appearance of Bread and Wine, in what ſort <note place="margin">p. 743.</note> ſoever he Underſtands it, in the Fathers of the ſeventh and eighth Centuries, nor that the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is hid under the Vail of this Appearance. The inſtance he gives us of a Man that is compoſed of Body and Soul, is vaſtly different; the Soul is not an inviſible and impalpable Body, 'tis a real Spirit; and the Body is not an appearance of a Body, that has nothing of reality in it; it is a Body in Propriety of Nature and Subſtance. When then we ſay of a Man that he is an immortal and ſpiritual Being in reſpect of his Soul, or that he is a mortal and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Being, in reſpect of his Body; or that he is mortal and immortal, conſidering him as a Body and Soul joyned together, this Language is Natural and eaſie to be underſtood without any Explication; becauſe the Principles on which it is eſtabliſhed, are obvious to Reaſon; and we may well ſuppoſe that thoſe to whom we direct our Diſcourſe are not Ignorant of them. But if Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will have the Expreſſions of the Fathers of the ſeventh or eighth Centuries to be grounded on theſe Principles of the Apperance of Bread, which in truth is not Bread and the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> concealed inviſibly under this Vail, he muſt without any more ado ſhew us that theſe Principles were known to the People; for it cannot be ſuppoſed they knew 'um Naturally. And thus his Inſtance is not at all to the purpoſe.</p>

                        <p>IT is now eaſie to perceive that all theſe preparations, with which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would clog his Readers mind, is only a handſom excuſe for the weakneſs of his proofs; and an authentick declaration that he could not find the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, and the Real Preſence in Authors of the 7th. and 8th. Centuries: for had he any thing to alledg that was conſiderable, 'tis evident he would never have taken ſo many circuits; and this is a certain ſign, that theſe Doctrines were neither eſtabliſhed nor known in the Church, during thoſe ages; and this will appear more clearly if we caſt our eyes on the paſſages he has produc'd, there being never a one of 'em that preciſely contains the Converſion of the ſubſtance of Bread, or ſubſtantial Preſence of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in the Euchariſt, nor from whence they can be neceſſarily inferred.</p>

                        <p>MOREOVER, Can Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> imagine the world takes no notice of ſo many other expreſſions ſo frequent in the Liturgies, and Authors of theſe ſame Centuries, mentioned by us, which call the Euchariſt, <hi>the Sacrament of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, the myſtery of our Lords Body, the Sacrament of his Incarnation, the Sacrament of his Humanity, the myſtery of his Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, the Sacrament of his Paſſion, the image of his Sacrifice, which the Church Celebrates in remembrance of his Sufferings.</hi> It is certain that theſe paſſages wherein we find theſe expreſſions, are as ſo many Commentaries that help us to a right underſtanding of the others, whence Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would draw advantage; becauſe 'tis very ordinary and natural to give to a Sacrament, which is a ſign, a memorial, and an image, the name of the thing which it repreſents, according to the obſervation of S. <hi>Iſidor</hi> himſelf, <hi>We are wont,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to give to Images the names of thoſe things which they</hi>

Thus muſt we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the title which <hi>Bede</hi> gives very often to the Sacrament, calling it <hi>the myſtery or the Sacrament of our Lords Incarnation;</hi> for he means 'tis an action wherein by myſtical Symbols men repreſent his Incarnation.

Now theſe expreſſions give us eaſily to underſtand what the Church of thoſe Ages pretended, when ſhe applyed to the Euchariſt the term of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; for ſhe deſigned only to attribute the name of the thing it ſelf to the ſacred ſign it repreſents: and there's no likelihood, that Authors of thoſe times that made ſo ſcrupulous a profeſſion to follow S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> even to the copying out his Writings to inſert them in their own in proper terms, as appears from <hi>Iſidor</hi>'s Books, <hi>Bede</hi>'s, <hi>Alcuinus;</hi> I ſay there's no likelihood they would forget what their Maſter had ſaid touching this Myſtery, <hi>the Lord ſcrupled not to ſay, This is my Body, when he gave the</hi>

                        <p>'TIS to no purpoſe for Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to urge the words of the Liturgy of <hi>Illyricus, Proeſta Domine Jeſu Chriſte fili Dei vivi, ut qui corpus &amp; ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ch. 3. p. 749, 750.</note>

Corpus &amp; ſanguinem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prium</hi> do only ſignifie <hi>Corpus &amp; ſanguinem tuum,</hi> thy Body and Blood, not the Body and Blood of another, as the ancient Prieſts cauſed to be caten the Body of a Sacrifice different from their own Body. For the Son of God who gave his own Body and Blood for us, gives us them to eat and drink in this Sacrament; nor that our mouths receive their proper ſubſtance, the Liturgy does not ſay ſo, but becauſe they receive the ſigns and tokens of 'um, whilſt our ſouls receive this Body it ſelf and Blood ſpiritually.</p>
                        <p>'TIS moreover in vain that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would perſuade us theſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Liturgies which term the Euchariſt the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>do naturally imprint the Idea of a Real Preſence. To prevent,</hi> ſays he, <note place="margin">Ch. 3. p. 751, 752.</note> 
                           <hi>the peoples miſtakes by all theſe terms of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, the Prieſts muſt have continually warn'd them to take notice that by the words of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, the proper Body of Jeſus Chriſt, they meant only its figure. This ſenſe muſt have been expreſly explained in all the Liturgies, and an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer appointed to make it thus underſtood by the people; for otherwiſe 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but they muſt fall into the opinion of the Real Preſence. And this effect being neceſſary and inevitable, it ought to have been the chiefeſt care and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the Fathers to hinder it, had they not themſelves been of this opinion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>ALL this diſcourſe has nothing in it but what may be eaſily anſwered. We have already ſufficiently replyed to it. 'Tis true this term of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt taken ſeparately imprints immediately the Idea of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Body of Jeſus Chriſt, but this ſame term applyed to the Euchariſt,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41961:234"/> (which both ſenſe and reaſon ſhew us to be Bread, which Religion makes us comprehend as a myſtery that repreſents the Incarnation and Paſſion of our Saviour) does not naturally from any other I dea than that of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. There needs no Officer appointed on purpoſe to give notice of this to the people, <hi>nor ſound of Trumpet</hi> to publiſh it, (as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſpeaks in another place.) Senſe, Reaſon and the common notions of Religion were <hi>Officers</hi> ſufficient to give this Idea, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh this to be the ſenſe of this term when applyed to the Euchariſt. When the Scripture in an hundred places has called our Saviour the Sun, the day Star from on High, the light of the World, the true light that enlightneth every man that cometh into the world, I do not find that it ſetled Officers on purpoſe to give notice, that it meant not a corporal Light, or Sun, but a Myſtical one. I do not find the Jews employed an <hi>Officer</hi> to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the people, that that Lamb commonly called the Paſſover, that is to ſay, the paſſage, was not really a paſſage but only the commemoration of a paſſage. S. <hi>Paul</hi> did not make uſe of one when he wrote, <hi>that we are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with Chriſt by Baptiſm, that we are made the ſame plant with him by the conformity of his Death and Reſurrection, that we are new Creatures, that there is a new man formed in us;</hi> and I know not how many other expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are eaſily underſtood by the bare conſideration of the matter to which they are applyed. The Fathers have not employ'd an Officer when they called the poor, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, the ſame Jeſus Chriſt that ſhed his Blood for us, who was delivered and put to death for us, not his Prophets but he himſelf.</hi> Neither have they employed one when they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Church, <hi>the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, the very Body of Jeſus Chriſt, the real Body of Jeſus Chriſt, properly the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, the undoubted Body of Jeſus Chriſt, the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, not his Veſtment, but himſelf;</hi> nor when they ſaid, <hi>that we are one and the ſame perſon with him, the ſame Body, the ſame ſubſtance by Faith, that we are transformed into him, changed into his Fleſh, changed into his Body.</hi> Should Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Principle take place the world muſt have a great many Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; for there's nothing more common than not only the metaphorical uſe of theſe terms, but even the exaggeration of them.</p>
                        <p>'TIS moreover in vain that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has painfully collected into a Chapter for that purpoſe whatſoever paſſages he could find here and there not only amongſt the Latines now in queſtion, but likewiſe from amongſt the Greeks, Copticks, Ethiopians, Armenians, Neſtorians, which bear that the Euchariſt is the <hi>very Body of Jeſus Chriſt, his proper Body, or properly his Body, his real Body, his true Body.</hi> I ſhall reply to this heap of paſſages in two manners, firſt in general, and ſecondly in particular.</p>
                        <p>IN general, I ſay, there is not one of theſe expreſſions which is ſufficient from whence ſolidly to conclude that thoſe which have made uſe of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the ſubſtantial Preſence which the Roman Church teaches, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is not one of 'um but is uſed on other ſubjects wherein evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there's neither Tranſubſtantiation nor the Real Preſence, becauſe they are all capable of another ſenſe, and that they may have been employed in other reſpects than that which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> attributes to them.</p>
                        <p>To begin by that of the <hi>Body it ſelf of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> we now ſee the Fathers have uſed this term on occaſion of the poor, <hi>God,</hi> ſays <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi>

And then moreover we do not ſcruple to joyn this term to other figurative terms, as when <hi>Origen</hi> ſaid, <hi>That God</hi>

                        <p>THE terms of <hi>true</hi> and <hi>truly</hi> are likewiſe often uſed in occaſions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they cannot ſignifie either a literal verity, or a reality of ſubſtance; and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does himſelf acknowledg that we find in the Fathers, <hi>That Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>TO hinder us from making advantage of theſe examples, Mr, <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſays, <hi>That when of two things, the one ſtands for a figurative truth, and the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">p. 780.</note> 
                           <hi>other ſerves only for a figure, men commonly uſe the word true and proper when even the term to which 'tis joyned is metaphorical. Thus,</hi> adds he, <hi>We ſay the Chriſtians be the true Iſraelites, that Jeſus Chriſt is the true Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec, that the Church is the true Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt, that Jeſus Chriſt is the true Sun, the true light, the true Vine, becauſe that the carnal Iſraelites were but the figure in reſpect of the Chriſtians, that Melchiſedec was the figure of Jeſus Chriſt, that the viſible Sun is only the image of the inviſible Sun, which is Jeſus Chriſt, that the terreſtial Vines repreſent to us the coeleſtial one, that humane Marriages are the figure of the union of Jeſus Chriſt with the Church. And the reaſon of theſe expreſſions is moreover the ſame as that of others. For 'tis clear the thing figured contains more truly the quality denoted by the figure,</hi>
                           <pb n="77" facs="tcp:41961:235"/> 
                           <hi>which has it only in repreſentation. Let a man but read,</hi> ſays he moreover, <hi>the other examples, and he'l find that 'tis always the figure which is affirm'd of the thing figured, and that the word</hi> verè, <hi>which is thereunto added, ſignifies that this thing figurated does really contain the quality which the figure poſſeſſes only in repreſentation: and therefore it is that theſe expreſſions cannot be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. 'Tis ſaid that Jeſus Chriſt is truly a ſtone, that he is truly a door, truly the light, the true</hi> Noah. <hi>But we do not ſay the ſtones, the doors, the light,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are truly Jeſus Chriſt. We ſay the Apoſtles are the true Iſraelites, but we do not ſay the Iſraelites are truly Apoſtles. 'Tis ſaid that a good man is truly a Tree planted by the Rivers ſide; but not that a Tree planted by the River ſide is a good man. We may ſay then according to this ſenſe, that Jeſus Chriſt is truly Bread, truly Wine, becauſe he poſſeſſes by way of exeellency the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities figured by the Bread and Wine; but we cannot ſay in this ſenſe that the Bread and Wine of the Euchariſt are truly the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; becauſe the Bread and Wine do not ſtand here for a thing figured, nor the Body of Jeſus Chriſt for a figure.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE firſt reflection to be made on this diſcourſe is, that he refutes and overthrows the Argument which the Doctors of the Roman Church do commonly draw from our Saviours words in the 6th. of S. <hi>John, My fleſh is truly meat, and my blood is truly drink:</hi> For if the term of <hi>truly</hi> may be applied to the thing figured, to ſignifie that it contains by way of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency the qualities of the figure, the meat and drink ſtanding for a figure, and the Fleſh and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt ſtanding for the thing figured, there's no longer any reaſon to conclude from theſe words that the Fleſh and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt are meat and drink properly in a literal ſenſe, than there would be to conclude from thence that Jeſus Chriſt is literally a Door and a Sun, <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Melchiſedec;</hi> that a good man is really a Tree, and that the Chriſtians are literally Iſraelites under pretence there's uſed in 'um the term of <hi>truly.</hi> When then we ſhall be offered this expreſſion of our Saviour, <hi>My fleſh is truly meat, and my blood is truly drink,</hi> we need only deſire that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> may be the judg of this difference; for what he now ſaid decides clearly the queſtion in our favour.</p>
                        <p>IN the ſecond place, ſuppoſing what he offers were abſolutely true, yet the conſequence which we draw from theſe examples would for all that be good and ſolid; for 'tis ſufficient for us to ſhew that the terms of <hi>true</hi> and <hi>truly</hi> comprehend not always a reality of ſubſtance, and that very often they only ſignifie a reality of virtue or quality. Now this is what apears clearly by theſe examples. 'Tis ſaid of Jeſus Chriſt that he is truly a Sun, a Stone, a Door, becauſe the qualities of the Sun, of a Stone and a Door are in Jeſus Chriſt, and that he has in our reſpect the vittue of all theſe things. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> confeſſes it, why may we not then as well ſay, that the Bread of the Euchariſt is truly the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, by ſuppoſing that this Bread hath the virtue and efficacy of it? I grant it cannot be ſaid of a figure that 'tis truly the original; this cannot be unleſs when we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it as a meer figure under the reſpect of a repreſentation only; but what hinders us from applying this term to a thing which has all the virtue of another, and which will make us feel all the effects of it, whether it be otherwiſe the figure of it or not? The Goſpel does not contain the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, but only its virtue; and yet <hi>Etherius</hi> and <hi>Beatus</hi> aſſert, <hi>that 'tis truly the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. What is this</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>IN all theſe examples I now alledged, concerning the Goſpel, the Poor, and the Church, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> cannot ſay that Jeſus Chriſt, or his Body ſtand for a figure; nor that theſe things, ſtand for figured truths. For the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is not the figure of the Goſpel, nor our Saviour the figure of a poor man; and the Church, to ſpeak properly, is not the truth figured by the Body of our Lord. Yet do the Fathers aſſure us that this Goſpel, and this Church are truly the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Poor
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41961:236"/> are truly Jeſus Chriſt. Whence it follows, there's nothing more vain than Mr. <hi>Arnauds</hi> remark, <hi>That we cannot ſay the Bread and Wine of the Euchariſt are truly the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe the Bread and Wine ſtand not for a thing figured, nor the Body of Jeſus Chriſt for a figure.</hi> On this Maxim the Fathers could not ſay the Church is truly the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Goſpel truly this Body; nor that the Poor are truly the Lord himſelf; and yet they have ſaid it as well as that the Euchariſt is truly the Body. Granting Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> one cannot ſay a figure, as a figure, is really the thing it ſelf which it repreſents, he can hence conclude no more but this, that what the Fathers have ſaid of the Bread of the Euchariſt, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is truly the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, they did not ſay this in reſpect of the Bread being a figure; but this does not hinder 'um from ſaying it on other accounts, either inaſmuch as that the Bread is accompanied with the whole virtue of the Body, or inaſmuch as it communicates this virtue ſpiritually to our ſouls.</p>
                        <p>THERE are ſo many ſeveral reſpects wherein we may ſay the Sacrament is <hi>the true Body,</hi> or <hi>truly the Body</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, without any regard to its ſubſtance, that 'tis matter of real wonder to me Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſhould ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently urge thoſe terms, and pretend 'um to be ſuch a great argument. For example, thoſe that conſider the Hereſie of the <hi>Marcionites,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees</hi> who denied our Saviour Chriſt aſſumed a true Body, and allowed only a phantaſm, might not they ſay of the Euchariſt that 'tis <hi>our Lords true Body,</hi> to ſignifie it to be the myſtery of a true Body, and not the myſtery of a falſe and imaginary one, ſuch as theſe Hereticks attributed to him, in the ſame ſenſe as a Roman Catholick who has regard to the falſe Idea which the Jews form to themſelves of a temporal Meſſias may well ſay of a Crucifix, or another image of our Saviour, that this is the true Meſſias who was to come into the world, in oppoſition to the fantaſtical Meſſias of the Unbelievers.</p>
                        <p>THOSE that reſpect the truth of the words of our Saviour, who called the Bread his Body, might not they likewiſe ſay, 'tis <hi>truly his Body,</hi> not to determine the ſenſe of theſe words, but to eſtabliſh only the certainty of them, and repreſent 'um true beyond all queſtion, in the ſame ſenſe in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to prophane perſons who ſcoff at the words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who tells us that <hi>we are buried with Chriſt in Baptiſm, and made one and the ſame plant with him through the conformity of his Death and Reſurrection,</hi> I would not ſcruple to ſay that Baptiſm is <hi>truby our death,</hi> our Burial and Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with Jeſus Chriſt, to ſignifie only that the words of the Apoſtle are very true, being rightly underſtood.</p>
                        <p>SUCH as conſider the figures and legal ſhadows which repreſented the Body of Chriſt very imperfectly, which gave only a confuſed and obſcure Idea of it, and communicated only faintly the virtue of it, might not they ſay, in comparing them with our Euchariſt, that this here is <hi>the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to ſignifie that it gives us a true, lively, diſtinct and perfect Idea of it, that it fully communicates it to the hearts of the faithful, and makes it fell all the virtues of it, in the ſame ſenſe as <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> comparing the ancient figures with our Baptiſm, did not ſtick to call this here the <hi>truth</hi> in oppoſition to the figure. <hi>Paſs we,</hi> ſays he, <hi>from</hi>

There</hi> Moſes <hi>was ſent to deliver the people from the oppreſſion of Egypt; here Jeſus Chriſt was ſent to deliver us from the bondage of ſin. There the Blood of a Lamb ſtopt the deſtroying Angel, here the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, the Lamb without ſpot or wrinkle, protects us againſt the Devils. There the tyrant purſued the people to the Red Sea, here the Devil purſues us as far as the ſalutiferous waters. There the Tyrant was drowned in the Sea, here the Devil is ſuffocated in the water of Salvation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THOSE that conſidered the effect of the conſecration of the Bread which makes it to be really, and not by a ſimple imagination, the myſtery of our Lord's Body, might they not ſay that 'tis <hi>truly the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in truth,</hi> not to inſinuate it to be ſo in proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but to ſignifie its being the myſtical Body of Jeſus Chriſt, is not a thing which has no other foundation than our own imagination, but that which is grounded on the things themſelves, either becauſe our Saviour Chriſt has thus ordained it in inſtituting his Holy Sacrament in the Church, or foraſmuch as the Eternal Father has ratifi'd this Inſtitution, or that the Holy Spirit really deſcends on the Bread to conſecrate it. An adopted Son con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering his adoption was real, and not illuſory or conceited, may rightly ſay that he is <hi>truly</hi> the Son of ſuch a one; and in this ſenſe every faithful perſon may ſay with aſſurance, he is <hi>truly</hi> the Son of God. 'Tis in this ſame ſenſe that S. <hi>Baſil</hi> tells us, <hi>That if our fleſh be worthy of God, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes</hi>

                        <p>THOSE in fine who conſider the opinion of the Greeks, that the Bread is made the Body of Jeſus Chriſt by an union with the natural body; and by way of growth and augmentation, may not they likewiſe ſay that 'tis truly this body, and yet not eſtabliſh 'tis the ſame numerical ſubſtance which our Saviour has in Heaven; but to ſignifie that this ſubſtance here, and that there, are not two different Bodies, but one and the ſame Body; as we have already more than once explained; in the ſame ſenſe as the augmentations which are made to a Houſe or Ground become truly this Houſe, or this ground, or the Kings Conqueſts added to his Kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come truly his Kingdom, by virtue of their union.</p>
                        <p>ALL which clearly ſhews that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has much miſreckoned himſelf when he believed there were but two occaſions wherein men uſed theſe terms of <hi>true</hi> and <hi>truly,</hi> the one when they affirm the figure of the Original; as when we ſay that our Saviour Chriſt is the true <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> the true Son, the true Vine; and the other <hi>when we would prevent any kind</hi>

                        <p>BUT ſuppoſing they deſigned to prevent a doubt; can there ariſe no other from the ſubject of the Euchariſt, but what relates to Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, or the ſubſtantial Preſence? May not a man doubt of the truth of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt conſidered in it ſelf, and in reference to the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? All thoſe ancient Hereticks, Marcionites, Manichees, have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doubted of it, but boldly affirmed that 'twas only a Phantaſm.

                           <hi>THIS doubt,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud, muſt have two qualities.</hi> For firſt, <hi>As this expreſſion has been generally received by all people; this muſt therefore be a general doubt, and muſt naurally ariſe in the minds of all men.</hi> Secondly, <hi>As no body ever made uſe of this expreſſion, but only on the ſubject of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, this muſt be a particular doubt belonging to the Euchariſt, and which cannot be extended to all the other Sacraments.</hi> How excellent is Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> at engroſſing of objects. He has gathered here and there, from ſeveral Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that lived in ſundry Churches, and at divers times ſome thirty paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges taken in a counter ſenſe that ſpeak differently, one in one manner, others in another, in different ſignifications, and this he makes to be the <hi>language</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">P. 774.</note> 
                           <hi>of all people,</hi> In another place, he aſſures us this is the <hi>language of all Nations and all Ages.</hi> A man cannot ſay an expreſſion has been generally received by all people, and in all ages, unleſs he has run over the Authors of all Ages, and ſhew'd that this expreſſion was received by the greateſt part amongſt 'um; for which purpoſe thirty paſſages gathered at random are not ſufficient. Moreover the expreſſion in queſtion ſhould appear in all the paſſages, and not one in ſome of 'em, and another in others. Beſides the expreſſion muſt be uſed every where in the ſame ſenſe. But we find no ſuch thing here. We have only about ſome thirty paſſages, in one of which there's the term of <hi>ſame,</hi> in another that of <hi>proper,</hi> or <hi>properly,</hi> in another that of <hi>true,</hi> or <hi>truly,</hi> and they are uſed in different ſenſes too, as will appear from the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular examination we ſhall make of them. How can this then be called <hi>an expreſſion generally received by all people, the language of all Nations, and that of all ages?</hi> For my part I call it an illuſion.</p>
                        <p>BUT ſuppoſing the expreſſion of <hi>true,</hi> or <hi>truly</hi> to have been generally received by all people, as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſuppoſes it was, why muſt it needs proceed from a general doubt that naturally ariſes in the minds of all men? May it not happen that the ſame expreſſion has been uſed in divers ages and amongſt divers people under different reſpects, and yet have been uſed for different ends, and on different occaſions. 'Tis not good reaſoning to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude there has been an univerſal and uniform reaſon in all Ages and amongſt
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41961:238"/> all people that has obliged them to make uſe of a term under pretence that it has been every where and at all times uſed. For how many ancient terms are there which are at this day in uſe, altho the reaſon of their being at firſt uſed no longer ſubſiſts? The uſe of terms is a thing unaccountable enough, and ſufficiently ſubject to change, either in regard of divers People, or Ages, and the occaſions, the reaſons or principles of this uſe are no leſs unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able too.</p>
                        <p>SUPPOSING this expreſſion has been generally received by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral reaſon, why muſt this reaſon be a general doubt that naturally ariſes in the minds of all men? Is it not ſufficient that it was a general intereſt which all Chriſtians had to eſtabliſh the truth of the Nature and Humane Subſtance in the Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, and to make thereof a common confeſſion in the Sacrament it ſelf of his Incarnation, I mean in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, for ſo the Fathers have called it? Is it not ſufficient 'twas a general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt which they had in all places and in all Ages to receive with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found reſpect the words of Jeſus Chriſt, who has ſaid of the Bread, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and to acknowledg publickly the truth of them? Theſe two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts are general, belong to all times, and all Nations, and are a ſufficient reaſon of this expreſſion in queſtion, were it as general as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſays it was.</p>
                        <p>BUT in fine, ſuppoſing it was a general doubt that occaſion'd theſe terms of <hi>true</hi> and <hi>truly,</hi> I ſay 'tis ſufficient 'twas a doubt likely to happen in the minds of weak perſons, and not neceſſarily in thoſe of all men. For there have been weak Chriſtians at all times, and in all places, the Church having never been without 'um, and of whom there ought always to be a particular care taken. Now this doubt touching the virtue of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, that it can ſpiritually communicate to us the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, that it procures us the remiſſion of our Sins, the Grace of Sanctification, the hope of Everlaſting life, that by it we obtain the Communion of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; this doubt, I ſay, eaſily ariſes in the minds of weak perſons, who, as I have already ſaid, are ſufficiently puzled at the ſimplicity of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, wherein there only appears Bread and Wine. Suppoſing then one ſhould ſay that the terms of the <hi>true</hi> Body of Jeſus Chriſt, or of <hi>truly</hi> the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, were only uſed to prevent this doubt, to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the weak in this regard, and conciliate more reſpect to the Sacrament, what can Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> find in this which is not reaſonable, and conformable to the ſenſe of the Church.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>WERE there any body now,</hi> ſays he, <hi>tempted with this doubt, and</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Page 783.</note> 
                           <hi>needed to be ſtrengthened againſt it, does not common ſenſe ſhew that he would expreſs it in proper terms to make himſelf underſtood, and diſacknowledg it by expreſſions which are directly contrary to it. He will ſay for example that he doubts whether God works on our ſouls by means of the Bread of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, and whether he fills it with his efficacy. He will ſay that he does not doubt but the Euchariſt is endowed with the virtue of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> but he will never think of expreſſing <hi>this doubt in theſe terms, I doubt whether the Euchariſt be the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, nor of rejecting it in theſe here, I believe the Euchariſt to be the true and proper Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>LET Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> tell us if he pleaſes why theſe pretended doubters (whom he introduces without any occaſion, or reaſon) would not conſult
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41961:238"/> common ſenſe whereby to expreſs their doubt in intelligible terms, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing they doubted of Tranſubſtantiation, or the ſubſtantial preſence. Why ſhould they not ſay, <hi>We doubt whether the ſubſtance of Bread be changed into the ſubſtance of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, or we doubt whether the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt be contained under the vail of the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of Bread.</hi> Thoſe that have now their minds poſſeſſed with theſe doubts, do they think of propoſing them in theſe equivocal terms which need a Commentary to explain them, <hi>We doubt whether the Euchariſt be the Body of Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> Clear and proper terms are not ſo hard to be found, had the Church then believed the ſubſtance of Bread to be converted into the ſubſtance of Jeſus Chriſt, and the common opinion it ſelf againſt which they would form their doubts would have furniſhed them with requiſite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. Let Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> likewiſe tell us why this doubt was not repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in formal terms, by ſaying, <hi>We muſt believe that the ſubſtance of Bread is changed into that of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and that under the accidents of Bread is contained the proper ſubſtance of this Body.</hi> Let him ſhew us from Antiquity his pretended doubt explained in requiſite terms according to the ſenſe he gives it, and I will ſhew him that which he finds ſo ridiculous ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to my ſenſe in <hi>Palladius, How are the gifts,</hi> ſaid a Religious <note place="margin">Pallad. Hiſt. Lauſ. cap. 75.</note> perſon, <hi>able to ſanctifie me</hi>? I will ſhew him that this is in effect the doubt which was heretofore deſign'd to be prevented, as appears by <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria; God,</hi> ſays he, <hi>changes the things offered into the efficacy of his Fleſh,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Apud, Vict. Ant. Miſſ.</note> AND WE NEED NOT DOUBT BUT THIS IS TRUE: and by <hi>Elias</hi> of <hi>Crete, God changes the things offered into the efficacy of his Fleſh,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Elias Cret. in Greg.</note> AND DOUBT NOT BUT THIS IS TRUE. Let him ſhew us the Fathers have ſaid that the Euchariſt is the true Body, or truly the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, in reference to the queſtion of the Converſion, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Preſence, and I will ſhew him they have ſaid it in reference to the queſtion touching the virtue. For <hi>Walafridus Strabo,</hi> an Author of the 9th. Century, having given this Title to one of the Chapters of his Book, <hi>De Virtute Sacramentorum,</hi> ſays afterwards in the Text of the ſame Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, <note place="margin">Valafridus Strabo, de rec. Eccleſ. cap. 17. Rupert in Mat. cap. 10.</note> by way of confirmation, <hi>That the Myſteries are truly the Body and Blood of our Lord.</hi> And <hi>Rupert,</hi> altho he lived in the 12th. Century, that is to ſay, in a time wherein Tranſubſtantiation had introduced it ſelf into the Latin Church, yet ſaid, <hi>That the Bread is rightly called and is TR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LY the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe in reference to us it effects the ſame thing as the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, Crucified, Dead and Buried.</hi> Moreover Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> has no reaſon to be ſo poſitive in affirming that <hi>the doubt was rejected in theſe terms, I believe the Euchariſt to be the true and proper Body of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> nor to make the world believe that <hi>all Nations and Ages</hi> ſpake in this ſort. The term of <hi>true</hi> may be met with in ſome paſſages which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> alledges, and that of <hi>proper</hi> in others, and both of theſe are therein uſed in ſenſes far different from that which he gives them; but he muſt not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this pretence form this propoſition, <hi>That the Euchariſt is the true and proper Body of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> for there's a great deal of difference between theſe terms being ſeparate, (which offer themſelves in divers paſſages, and in divers Authors) and theſe ſame terms joyned together by way of exage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. I confeſs that <hi>Nicephorus</hi> according to <hi>Allatius</hi>'s relation joyns together the two terms of <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>truly;</hi> but beſides that <hi>Nicephorus</hi> is not all Ages, nor all Nations; we have already ſhew'd that he ſpeaks on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus upon an Hypotheſis far different from that of Tranſubſtantiation, or the ſubſtantial Preſence; and therefore Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> cannot make any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of what he ſays.</p>

                        <p>AND theſe are my general anſwers to Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s paſſages. Should we deſcend at preſent to the particular examination of theſe paſſages, we muſt firſt lay aſide thoſe of <hi>Anaſtaſius Sinait,</hi> of <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> of the ſecond Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice,</hi> of <hi>Nicephorus</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the profeſſion of Faith made by the Saracens that were Converts of the 12th. Century, and that of the <hi>Horologium</hi> of the Greeks; for they have been all of 'em al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſufficiently anſwer'd: 'tis only needful to remember what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready eſtabliſhed touching the real Belief of the Greek Church. There muſt likewiſe be retrenched thoſe that be taken from the Liturgies of the Copticks and Ethiopians, ſeeing we have already anſwered them. We have alſo anſwer'd that taken out of the common Liturgy of the Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, or to ſpeak better, the Armenians themſelves have anſwer'd it.</p>
                        <p>IF thoſe of <hi>Leopolis</hi> call the Bread and Wine <hi>the true Body and the true Blood of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord and Saviour,</hi> there is no likelihood for all this that they have another Belief than that of the reſt of the Armenians, who formally declare, as we have already ſeen, that they mean nothing elſe by theſe terms, than a true myſtery of this Body and Blood, and in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it is ſaid in the ſame Liturgy whence Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has taken his Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Prieſt ſays in Communicating, <hi>I eat by Faith, O Lord Jeſus</hi>

                        <p>THE paſſage of <hi>Adam</hi> the Arch-deacon of the Neſtorians, mention'd by <hi>Strozza,</hi> is impertinently alledg'd, for two reaſons: Firſt, That theſe are the words of a man that reconciled himſelf with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who in embracing its Religion, wrote in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf under the inſpection of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> V. and from whoſe words by conſequence there can be nothing concluded touching the Neſtorian Church. Secondly, That what he ſays concerning <hi>our eating the true Body of God, but of God Incarnate; that we drink truly the Blood of a Man, but of a Man that is God,</hi> relates not to our queſtion, nor is not ſaid in this reſpect, but in regard of the Error of the Neſtorians, who will have the Body of Jeſus Chriſt to be the Body of a mere man, and not the true Body of God Incarnate. What's this to the queſtion, to wit, Whether that which we receive with the mouths of our bodies be the ſubſtance it ſelf of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
                        <p>WHAT he alledges touching the Liturgy of the Indian Chriſtians that added to the ſaying of our Saviour theſe words, <hi>In veritate,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Hoc eſt in veritate corpus, hic eſt in veritate ſanguis meus</hi> is a thing very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. 'Tis not likely <hi>Alexis Meneſez</hi> the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Goa</hi> who laboured to reduce theſe Indians to the Faith of the Roman Church would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched from their Liturgy theſe words <hi>in veritate,</hi> had he in truth found them in it. Thoſe that wrote the actions of this Arch biſhop, ſay, this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was made by a Biſhop that came from <hi>Babylon.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> tells us <hi>we muſt not much heed what they relate.</hi> This is a mere Chaos wherein a <note place="margin">Book 5. Ch. 10. p. 500.</note> man can comprehend nothing. <hi>The Deacon,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſings ſtill in their Maſs, Fratres mei ſuſcipite corpus ipſius filii Dei dicit Eccleſia.</hi> But what conſequence can be drawn from theſe words. 'Tis certain that this <hi>corpus ipſius filii Dei,</hi> is a clauſe added by <hi>Meneſez</hi> againſt the Error of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, who would have it to be no more than the Body of a mere man; for every one knows this was the Hereſie of the Neſtorians. There remains
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41961:239"/> ſtill in this Liturgy (as correct as 'tis) ſeveral paſſages that do not well agree with the Doctrine of the Roman Church, as what the Prieſt ſays, <hi>Jeſus</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Miſſae Chriſt. apud Indos Bibl. patr. tom. 6.</note> 
                           <hi>Chriſt our Lord the Son of God that was offer'd for our ſalvation, and who commanded us to Sacrifice in remembrance of his Paſſion, Death, Burial, and Reſurrection, receive this Sacrifice from our hands.</hi> Were the Sacrifice Jeſus Chriſt in his proper ſubſtance, there's no likelihood they would offer it to Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. Having read the paſſage of S. <hi>Paul, That whilſt we are in this Body we are abſent from the Lord, that we deſire to be out of the body, to have his preſence, that we deſire to pleaſe him whether preſent or abſent,</hi> &amp;c. rehearſed the Creed, the Prieſt ſays, <hi>This Sacrifice is in remembrance of the Paſſion, Death, Burial, and Reſurrection of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Then praying for the Conſecration, <hi>O Lord God,</hi> ſays he, <hi>look not upon the multitude of my ſins', and be not angry with us for the number of our Crimes, but by thy ineffable Grace Conſecrate this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> AND INDUE IT WITH THAT VIRTUE AND EFFICACY THAT IT MAY ABOLISH THE MULTITUDE OF OUR SINS, <hi>to the end that when thou ſhalt at laſt appear in that humane form which thou haſt been pleaſed to take on thee, we may find acceptance with thee.</hi> On one hand he reſtrains the Conſecration to the virtue or efficacy which God gives to the Sacrament for the aboliſhing of our ſins; and on the other formally diſtinguiſhes the Sacrament from the Humane Nature of Jeſus Chriſt, in which he will appear ar the laſt day. Immediately after he calls the gifts, <hi>the Holy Sacraments of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And then beſeeches God, <hi>they may be made worthy to obtain the remiſſion of their ſins by means of the Holy Body which they ſhall receive by Faith.</hi> Again, he ſays, <hi>That he Sacrifices the Myſtery of the Paſſion, Death, Burial and Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and prays to God, <hi>That his Holy Spirit may come down, and reſt on this Oblation, and ſanctifie it, to the end it may procure them the remiſſion of their ſins.</hi> He ſays not to the end it may change the ſubſtance of it, and convert it into that of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, which yet muſt have been ſaid, or ſomething equivalent thereunto, were this the formal effect of the Conſecration. Having recited our Lords words, <hi>This is my Body, this is my Blood,</hi> he adds, <hi>This ſhall be a pledg to us to the end of the world.</hi> And a little further, <hi>Eſay touched a live coal, his lips were not burnt with it, but his iniquity pardon'd. Mortal men receive a fire</hi> IN THE BREAD IT <hi>ſelf; and this fire preſerves their bodies, and conſumes only their ſins.</hi> 'Tis eaſie to perceive that by this fire which is in the <hi>Bread it ſelf,</hi> he means the Holy Spirit which he had already prayed for to come down and <hi>reſt</hi> on the Oblation. Explaining afterwards what this Myſtery is, <hi>Approach we all of us,</hi> ſays he, <hi>with fear and reſpect to the Myſtery of the precious Body and Blood of our Saviour, and with a pure heart, and a true Faith call we to remembrance his Paſſion and Reſurrection; and let us clearly comprehend them. For, for our ſakes the only Son of God has aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a mortal Body, a ſpiritual reaſonable and immortal Soul, and by his holy Law has reduced us from error to the knowledg of the truth, and at the end of his Oeconomy, offered on the Croſs the firſt fruits of our nature, he is riſen from the Dead, aſcended up into Heaven, and has left us his Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments as pledges to put us in mind of all the favours which he has beſtowed on us.</hi> Was not here a fitting place to make ſome mention of his corporeal Preſence in the Euchariſt; and having ſaid that he is aſcended up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, does it not ſeem, that inſtead of adding, he has left us his Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, he ſhould have ſaid, he yet preſents himſelf on the Altars, in the ſubſtance of his Body. Let Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> himſelf judg whether this Liturgy favours him.</p>

                        <p>AS to the ancient Liturgy of <hi>France,</hi> which bears that Jeſus Chriſt gives us his proper Body, I have already anſwer'd that theſe terms of <hi>proper Body,</hi> ſignifie only his Body; and I apply the ſame anſwer to the paſſages which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> alledges of S. <hi>Ireneus, Juvencus, Gaudencius,</hi> and of S. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> who likewiſe uſe the ſame term of proper <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>proprium corpus,</hi> ſignifies <hi>ſuum corpus,</hi> his Body, not that of another, but his own; for this is often the ſenſe of this term, as we have already ſhew'd.</p>
                        <p>S. <hi>Hilary</hi> ſays, <hi>There's no reaſon to doubt of the truth of the Fleſh, and Blood of our Lord.</hi> I acknowledg he ſpeaks of this Fleſh inaſmuch as 'tis communicated to us in the Sacrament; but I ſay alſo he means the ſpiritual Communication which Jeſus Chriſt hath given us in the act it ſelf of the Sacramental Communion: and that <hi>Hilary</hi>'s ſenſe is, we muſt not doubt but this Fleſh is really communicated to us, inaſmuch as our Souls are made really partakers of it.</p>

                           <hi>EPHRAM</hi> of <hi>Edeſſe</hi> ſpeaks likewiſe of the Spiritual Communion which we have with Jeſus Chriſt God and Man, when he ſays, <hi>that we eat the Lamb himſelf entire.</hi>

He adds, <hi>That all the people who are Believers eat the Fleſh of this Lamb, and drink his Blood, and yet the Lamb which was ſacrific'd remains whole and alive; and altho he be truly ſacrific'd, and his Fleſh truly eaten and drank, yet he remains whole and alive.</hi> This is an alluſion to the ancient Lamb of the Jews, which was firſt ſacrific'd, and afterwards eaten by the people, which was a figure of our Saviour, the true Lamb of God that was ſacrific'd on the Croſs; and whoſe Fleſh was eaten, and Blood ſpiritually drank by thoſe that believe in

The Lamb being divided, and not riſing again after he was ſlain, our Saviour Chriſt has this advantage over him that he is alive after his being ſacrific'd and eaten, without ſuffering any diviſion. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider this manducation abſolutely in it ſelf, or by comparing it to that of the ancient Lamb, it is true. For on one hand it is neither falſe nor illuſory, and on the other it is the truth figured by the manducation of the Lamb of the Jews.</p>
                        <p>THE paſſage of S. <hi>Leo,</hi> which ſays, <hi>We muſt in ſuch a manner draw near to the Divine Table, as not to doubt, in any wiſe, of the truth of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is very impertinently alledged. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is not to learn that <hi>Leo</hi> diſcourſes againſt the Eutychiens, who denied our Saviour had a real Body; and his ſenſe to be, that when we partake in the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of our Lord, we muſt not doubt but our Saviour has in himſelf, in his proper perſon, a real Body and Blood, and is real man.</p>
                        <p>'TIS now plainly ſeen, that this heap of paſſages which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has pretended to make of the conſent of all Nations and Ages, is but a meer illuſion, and that his deſign in wand'ring thus ftom his ſubject, was only to colour over the weakneſs of his proofs touching the 7th. and 8th. Centuries now in debate. He had ſo little to ſay concerning theſe Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that he thought it neceſſary to take the field, and circuit about to amuſe his Readers, and fill up his Chapters. But his ſubject matter is ſo little favourable to him on what ſide ſoever he turns himſelf, and howſoever he uſes it, that we may well ſay he loſes both his time and his pains.</p>

                           <hi>of theſe Ages, as well as in thoſe of the following. They could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt themſelves from uſing it, whatſoever their opinion was otherwiſe. But to judg of that which they had in effect, we muſt conſider what they tell us of the Euchariſt, when they explain to us what they believe of its nature and eſſence, when they do not deſign it, but teach what it is, when they do not only denote to us the matter which God has choſen, but tell us what God does in this matter, when they do not ſpeak of it according to the impreſſions of ſenſe, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſentiments of Faith.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To make in the ſenſe of the Authors in queſtion a ſolid oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the language of ſenſe, and that of Faith, it ought to be made appear, that according to them, theſe two languages juſtle one another; that they cannot be both of 'em true in the main, and that that of ſenſe is deceitful and illuſory, if taken according to the letter. But this is that which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does not demonſtrate. We know our ſenſes tell us, that 'tis bread, we know their depoſition is literal, for 'tis literally and without a figure that our ſenſes tell us that the Euchariſt is Bread and Wine. As often then as we find the Fathers of the 7th. and 8th. Centuries ſpeaking according to ſenſe, reaſon will guide us to the underſtanding of their language according to the letter, unleſs we are ſhew'd that according to theſe ſame Fathers, our Faith muſt correct this language; that ſhe declares it to be falſe, being taken according to the letter, and does not allow of it unleſs under the favour of an interpretation and a figure. Were this ſhew'd us, I confeſs then we ought to lay aſide this language of ſenſe, as being very improper for the diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us the true opinion of Authors. But till then, we have liberty to take it according to the purport of the ſenſes themſelves, which is to declare to us that the Euchariſt is real Bread and Wine. For unleſs it be ſhew'd us that thoſe who have uſed it, had an intention contrary to that of their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, we ought to ſuppoſe they have had even no other than that, for we muſt ever ſuppoſe in favour of nature and the general rule. That if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards there be met with in the expreſſions of Faith ſomething that ſeems
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41961:242"/> contrary to thoſe of ſenſe, 'tis more reaſonable to attribute a figure to the language of Faith which can well bear it, than to that of ſenſe which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally cannot ſuffer it. So that comparing theſe two kinds of expreſſions, <hi>Bread, and Wine, Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> one with the other, we muſt ever take the firſt in a literal ſenſe, and the ſecond in a figurative one, unleſs as I ſaid, we are ſhew'd the contrary by ſome expreſs declaration.</p>
                        <p>TO make likewiſe an exact oppoſition, between the matter of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, and its eſſence or nature, it muſt firſt be ſhew'd that this matter does no longer ſubſiſt, but ceaſes to be in the very moment wherein the Euchariſt is made. For if it ſubſiſts, it makes one part of the eſſence, or nature of the Sacrament; to wit, the material part, and we ſhall always have right to uſe for our advantage the paſſages which call the Sacrament <hi>Bread and Wine,</hi> altho they deſign the marter of it, ſeeing this matter ſubſiſts. Now of theſe two ſuppoſitions, either that the matter ſubſiſts, or does not ſubſiſt, that which affirms it ſubſits, is natural, in favour of which by conſequence we muſt always prejudicate, till ſuch time as the contrary is eſtabliſht by good proofs. I ſay, that the ſuppoſition that the matter ſubſiſts is the natural one. Firſt, Becauſe that in all the changes which happen in the world, there is ever a common ſubject which ſubſiſts, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never heard of that there was ever made a change of one thing into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, where the whole ſubſtance of this firſt thing has abſolutely ceaſed to be. Philoſophy can give us no inſtance of this, and even miracles wrought by the Almighty Power of God furniſh us not with any. Secondly, All the changes wrought by Grace leave the matter ſtill ſubſiſting. There's made according to the Scriptures and Fathers, a new Heaven, and a new Earth, a new Creature, and a new Man. A Temple is made of a Houſe, an ordinary Man is made a Biſhop, a Stone an Altar, Wood or Metal a Croſs, Water, and common Oyl Sacraments, without the matters ceaſing to be.</p>
                        <p>IT ſubſiſts on the contrary in all theſe inſtances. If then we may not draw advantage from the expreſſions of the Fathers which call the Euchariſt <hi>Bread and Wine,</hi> under pretence they deſign thereby the matter of it, we muſt be ſhewed that according to theſe Fathers themſelves this matter ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not after the Conſecration; for otherwiſe we ſhall ſtill naturally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the Fathers delivering themſelves with an honeſt plainneſs, and far from the proſpect of our Controverſie have regarded this matter as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting.</p>
                        <p>BUT ſuppoſing what I now ſaid ſignifies nothing, 'tis certain the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which I produced which deſign the matter of the Sacrament, do of themſelves eſtabliſh the ſubſiſtence of it, for they all conſider it after the Conſecration, and ſpeak of it as being ſtill the ſame as it was before, to wit, Bread and Wine. They ſay that 'tis <hi>an Oblation of Bread and Wine, an Oblation of the ſame kind as that of</hi> Melchiſedeck, <hi>Bread and Wine, which are the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, Bread which the Church eats, Bread with which is celebrated our Lords Paſſion, as the Ancients Celebrated it by the fleſh of Victims, Bread that came in the room of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Lamb to be the myſtery of Chriſt's Paſſion, Bread which has ſucceeded</hi> Aarons <hi>Sacrifices, Bread which our Lord held in his hands after he had bleſſed it, and by means of which he did in ſome ſort carry himſelf;</hi> to wit, inaſmuch as he held in his hands his own Sacrament. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41961:243"/> might take place, did they only ſay that <hi>the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is made of Bread,</hi> or that the <hi>Bread becomes, and is made this Body;</hi> for then one might diſpute whether the Bread be made this Body, either in ceaſing to be Bread, or in remaining ſo. But ſpeaking in the manner I now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, calling it Bread after the Conſecration, according to the language of ſenſe, which naturally admits not a figure, and without correcting or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining themſelves, is a ſufficient evidence they meant 'twas real Bread in ſubſtance.</p>
                        <p>YET let us ſee what they ſay of the Euchariſt, when according to Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> they deſign not the matter, but expound the nature and eſſence of it. Beſides what I already ſaid, that they commonly call it <hi>the Myſtery of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, the Sacrament of this Body, the Figure of this Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the Image of his Sacrifice, the Sacrament of his Incarnation, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Humanity, the Myſtery of his Humanity, the Myſtery of his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.</hi> Beſides this I ſay, 'tis certain they often explain themſelves in ſuch a manner that they eſtabliſh a formal diſtinction between the Sacrament, and Jeſus Chriſt himſelf repreſented by it, and leave it to be plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded they held not this ſubſtantial Preſence which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teaches.</p>
                        <p>IT is in this ſenſe that <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who lived to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the 6th. Century, and about the beginning of the 7th. wrote, <hi>That this Myſtery reiterates the Death of Chriſt, and altho ſince his</hi>

                        <p>WE read the ſame words in <hi>Bede,</hi> who has without doubt taken 'em from <hi>Iſidor;</hi> for 'twas the common cuſtom of the Authors of thoſe days to copy out one from another.

This is then what is meant by eating the meat which periſhes not, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to life everlaſting. Why prepare ye your teeth and belly, believe, and ye have eaten it: this is the Bread which came down from Heaven, to the end that he which eats of it may not die. This is meant of the virtue of the viſible Sacrament. He that eateth internally, not externally, that eateth with the heart, not with the teeth.</hi> And a little further, our Saviour <hi>explains what 'tis to eat his Body and drink his Blood; He that eateth my Fleſh and drinks my Blood dwelleth in me and I in him. To eat then this meat and drink this drink is to dwell in Jeſus Chriſt, and to have Jeſus Chriſt dwelling in us. So that he that dwells not in Jeſus Chriſt and Jeſus Chriſt in him, does not eat ſpiritually his Fleſh, altho he ſenſibly bites with the teeth the Sacrament of his Body and Blood; but rather eats and drinks to his condemnation the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of ſo great a thing.</hi> And again, <hi>The mark by which a man may know he has eaten and drank, is, that he dwells in Jeſus Chriſt, and has Jeſus Chriſt dwelling in him. We dwell in him when we are the Members of his Body, and he dwells in us when we are his Temple.</hi> And a little lower, <hi>The words which I tell ye are ſpirit and life.

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41961:245"/> Chriſt in the Euchariſt, which is true. He likewiſe ſuppoſes that if we eat not this Fleſh we remain deprived of Salvation, and this is moreover true. From whence he concludes men ought not to abſtain long from the uſe of the Sacrament, becauſe a total neglect of this means which Chriſt has ordained for the eating of his Fleſh and drinking his Blood, will put us in danger of being wholly deprived of them, for without eating and drinking this Fleſh and Blood, there is no hope of ſalvation. This is <hi>Iſidor</hi>'s ſenſe, whence there can be nothing concluded in favour of the Theſis which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> defends. For we ſpiritually eat our Lord's Fleſh in the due uſe of the Sacrament; and 'tis this manducation which S. <hi>Iſidor</hi> ſpeaks of, as appears from what he there ſays. <hi>Manifeſtrum eſt eos vivere qui corpus ejus attin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt.</hi> And as to what he aſſerts, that this is the Body, the Truth, the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, repreſented by the ancient Figures, we grant it; but deny it ought to be hence concluded, that the Sacrament is the Body it ſelf of Jeſus Chriſt in ſubſtance. I have ſufficiently elſewhere diſcourſed in what manner the ancient types related to our Sacraments, and thoſe that pleaſe to take the pains to read the firſt Chapter of the third part of my Anſwer to Father <hi>Nouet,</hi> will find there, if I be not miſtaken, enough to ſatisfie 'em in that particular.</p>

The ſenſe of <hi>Bede</hi> is, that the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt is received by the mouths of the Faithful, becauſe they receive the Wine which is the Sacrament of it.

                        <p>I ſhall elſewhere in its due place examine what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> alledges touching <hi>Amalarius, Florus, Drutmar,</hi> and ſome other Authors of the 9th. Century, Contemporaries with <hi>Paſchaſus.</hi> It only remains for the finiſhing of the diſcuſſion of the 7th. and 8th. to anſwer ſome ſlight Obſervations which he has made on a paſſage in the Book of Images, which goes under the name of <hi>Charlemain</hi>'s, The Author of this Book will not have the Euchariſt be called an <hi>Image,</hi> but the <hi>Myſtery</hi> or <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> pretends that by this Myſtery or Sacrament, we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Body it ſelf in ſubſtance: his reaſons are, Firſt, That 'tis the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Jeſus Chriſt which is repreſented by the types in the Old Teſtament. Now this Sacrament is according to the Author of the Book in queſtion, that which was repreſented by theſe ancient figures. Secondly, That 'tis the Body of Jeſus Chriſt which is the truth oppoſed to Images. Now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Author this Sacrament is not the image of it, but the truth in oppoſition to the image. Thirdly, That the reaſon why he will not have
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41961:245"/> it to be an image is, that our Saviour did not ſay, This is the image of my Body, but this is my Body. Fourthly, That 'tis of the Euchariſt we muſt underſtand what he ſays, <hi>That our Saviour did not offer for us an image but himſelf.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT 'tis no hard matter to anſwer theſe objections. The Sacrament of the Euchariſt may be conſidered in two reſpects, either in oppoſition to the thing it ſelf, of which 'tis the Sacrament, or in conjunction with this ſame thing. In the firſt reſpect, 'tis a ſign or a figure of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Charlemain</hi> himſelf calls it ſo in one of his Epiſtles to <hi>Alcui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> as we have already ſeen, and <hi>Bede</hi> gives it ſeveral times this title. But in the ſecond reſpect <hi>Charlemain</hi> denies we ought to give it the name of image or figure, becauſe he would diſtinguiſh it from the legal figures which were only bare repreſentations and ſhadows which did communicate the Body, or reality of that which they repreſented; whereas our Euchariſt communicates the Body and Blood it ſelf of Jeſus Chriſt ſacrificed for us on the Croſs, and repreſented by the ancient figures. He would have us call it then the Myſtery or Sacrament of this Body, and the reaſon which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges for it is, that 'tis not a bare repreſentation of a thing to come, as were thoſe of the ancient Law, 'tis the Myſtery of the Death of Jeſus Chriſt, of a Death I ſay that was really conſummated; and moreover, 'tis not a bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of this Death, but a Myſtery which communicates it to us. This is the ſence of the Author of the Book of Images, from whence it does not follow that the Euchariſt is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in ſubſtance, as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would hence conclude. For, for to conſider the Sacrament, in conjunction with the thing of which it is the Sacrament, 'tis not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that the thing be locally and ſubſtantially therein contained. It is ſufficient that it be really and truly communicated therein to us in a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical and moral manner. Now 'tis certain that this communication is made therein to the Faithful; and altho the manner of it be ſpiritual and myſtical, yet is it real and true. This is ſufficient for a man to ſay as the Author of that Book does, <hi>That the myſtery of the Body and Blood of our Lord is called now, not an image, but the truth, not a ſhadow but a body, not a figure of things to come, but the thing repreſented by the figures.</hi> Becauſe that in effect we receive therein the body and truth of the legal ſhadows. For this reaſon a man may ſay that this myſtery is the truth in oppoſition to the images of the ancient Teſtament; becauſe that in effect God gives us actually in it that which the Law contained only in types. This is ſufficient whereon to ground this remark, <hi>That our Saviour did not ſay, this is the image of my Body, but this is my Body that is given for you.</hi> Becauſe that in inſtituting this Sacrament he never deſign'd to communicate to us only a prefiguration, but his Body. In fine, this is ſufficient for a man to ſay with reaſon and good ſenſe, and with reſpect too to the Euchariſt, <hi>That our Saviour did not offer for us an image, but himſelf in ſacrifice;</hi> becauſe that which he offer'd once for us to God his Father on the Croſs, he offers, and gives it us in the Euchariſt. In a word, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s perpetual error is, in imagining that our Saviour Chriſt and his Body and Blood cannot be communicated to us, unleſs we receive corporeally in our hands and mouths the proper ſubſtance of them. I ſay, this is a miſtake exceedingly diſtant from the Doctrine of the Fathers, who tell us we receive Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, eat his Body and drink his Blood in the word of the Goſpel, in Baptiſm, as well as in the Euchariſt.</p>

That they uſe long diſcourſes to expound ſeparately each word as the term <hi>this,</hi> the word <hi>is,</hi> and the word <hi>Body.</hi> That by this means that which yields no trouble (when a man follows ſimply the courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and common ſenſe) becomes obſcure, and unintelligible. That ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing in like manner a man ſhould philoſophiſe on theſe words, <hi>Lazarus come forth,</hi> it's no hard matter for a man to entangle himſelf with 'em; for this <hi>Lazarus</hi> will be neither the Soul nor the Body ſeparately, nor the Soul and Body together, but a mere nothing. Now a mere nothing cannot come out of the Grave. That our Saviour did not ſpeak to be only underſtood by Philoſophers and Metaphyſicians, ſeeing he intended his Religion ſhould be followed by an infinite number of ſimple people, women and children, perſons ignorant of humane learning. That we muſt then judg of the ſenſe of theſe words by the general and common impreſſion which all theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons receiv'd without ſo many reflections. That to find this ſimple and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural impreſſion we muſt conſult the ſenſe wherein they have been effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally taken for the ſpace of a thouſand years, by all Chriſtians in the world which never had any part in our Diſputes. That our Saviours intention was rather to expreſs by theſe words the ſenſe in which they have been ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually taken by all Chriſtians in the world, which was not unknown to him; than that in which they have been underſtood in theſe latter days by a few Berengarian &amp; Calviniſtical Philoſophers. That he has right to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as a thing certain, that ſince the 7th. Century, all Chriſtians through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole earth have held the Doctrine of the Real Preſence and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, and that this conſent of all people for a thouſand years is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſhew what the ſimple impreſſion is, and conſequently the real ſenſe of Chriſts words.

                                 <p>THE deſign of this whole diſcourſe tends to caſt men into horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confuſions. I grant our Saviour intended not to ſpeak ſo as to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood only by Philoſophers, but on the contrary, that his Religion ſhould be embraced by infinite numbers of ignorant people, women, and children, and perſons uncapable of deep reaſoning. But if the ſenſe of theſe words muſt be ſought in the conſent of all Churches, theſe women and children, and ignorant people will be hard put to it to find it. How few perſons are there capable of themſelves to make this inquiſition, for which they muſt have skill in Languages, read two hundred Volumes, or more, attentively examine 'em, diſtinguiſh the times, places and occaſions, conſider the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of paſſages and drift of Authors, compare the various interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and do in a word a thouſand things neceſſary to prevent their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one thing for another? And as for thoſe that ſhall take this task upon 'em under the guidance of another, how many cheats are they to beware of? How ſhall they be certain that they ſhall have no falſe Authors impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 'em for true ones, forged Writings attributed to Authors, or falſe Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, corrupt Tranſlations, and falſe Explications to give them another ſenſe than the natural one, that they ſhall not be impoſed on by captious Arguings or frivolous Anſwers, yet well coloured; that they ſhall not be ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with fruitleſs diſcourſes to wear out their patience, and attention, and by this means make 'em fall into the Net. All this has been hitherto done, and I do not find ſuch as be guilty of this do amend whatſoever complaints have been made. I grant one may find the true ſenſe of our Saviour's words in the conſent of all Churches: But is it not a more ſhort, ſure, and eaſie way to ſeek it by conſidering the words themſelves, by comparing them with other Sacramental Expreſſions, by the nature of the Ordinance which our Saviour inſtituted, by the circumſtances that accompanied it, the deſign he propoſed in it, by his ordinary ways of expreſſing himſelf, by the other words he added, by the ſenſe wherein, according to all probability his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples underſtood him, by the explanations which S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives of it, and in ſhort by the genius and univerſal Spirit of the Chriſtian Religion. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man makes this inquiſition by himſelf, or under the direction of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, 'tis certain that the way which we offer is far leſs troubleſome and dangerous, eaſier and better accommodated to the capacity of the common people, than that of the conſent of all Churches. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſuppoſes this conſent from the 7th. Century to this preſent, becauſe he believes he has proved it. But were this ſuppoſition as certain and true in the main, as 'tis falſe and imaginary, it can reſide no where but in the imagination of thoſe that have read his Book. And how many are there in the rank of the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple people that never read it? Of thoſe amongſt 'em that have read it, how few have been capable to underſtand and Judg of it? Are they able to diſcern whether his citations be true or no, whether his Paſſages be faithfully tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, his Arguments concluſive, his Atteſtations allowable; and whether he has not concealed ſeveral things which ought to be known on this ſubject, for a man to be throughly informed in it? After all, reaſon requires 'em to ſuſpend their judgments till ſuch time as they have ſeen my Anſwer. And ſuppoſing my Anſwer does not ſatisfie 'em, how know they but that my weakneſs or ignorance has prejudiced the Cauſe I defend? In the mean time what will become of the Faith of theſe ſimple perſons, if they will make it depend on the conſent of all Churches, touching the ſenſe of our Saviours
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41961:247"/> words. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> under pretence of ſearching ſhort ways, throws men into ſuch labyrinths out of which 'tis impoſſible to get out.</p>

                                 <p>I grant that the true ſenſe of our Saviours words muſt be the ſimple and natural one. We diſpute touching this ſimple and natural ſenſe. Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> will needs have it to be that of Tranſubſtantiation, and the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, we affirm 'tis the Sacramental or figurative one. Suppoſing we could not on either ſide find out this ſimple and natural impreſſion which theſe words do of themſelves make in the minds of men, by reaſon of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute, and that we muſt go ſearch it amongſt thoſe that be free from theſe prejudices, it is not reaſonable we ſhould ſtop at thoſe that lived ſince the 7th. Century till now, to the prejudice of the firſt ſix ages. We muſt on the contrary begin from the ſix firſt. <hi>Tradition,</hi> ſaid one, not long ſince, <note place="margin">In the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on the requeſt of M. <hi>D' Ambrun,</hi> 9th. Remark.</note> whoſe word ought to be regarded, <hi>muſt begin from the Apoſtles, and paſs on till this preſent by an uninterrupted ſucceſſion.</hi> The firſt then that are to be conſulted, for the finding this ſimple impreſſion, muſt be the Apoſtles that heard immediately theſe words from our Lords own mouth. We muſt ſearch the Hiſtory of the Goſpel to ſee whether there be any thing that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers they took 'em in the ſenſe of Tranſubſtantiation, whether they have been ſurpriz'd by any aſtoniſhment, or raviſhed with admiration, or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with ſome doubt, whether 'tis likely they were imbued with principles on which this ſenſe is eſtabliſhed; as that a body ſhould be in ſeveral places at once, and accidents ſubſiſt without their ſubſtance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And whether they were not on the contrary imbued with ſome maxims very oppoſite to this ſenſe: as for inſtance, that to drink Blood was a crime ſtrictly forbidden by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, that the ſigns were called after the name of the things which they ſignifi'd, and whether it appears from any of their words or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they adored the Euchariſt. And 'tis here I think we ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and afterwards come to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and examine whether in what he has ſaid on this ſubject, or any others, there be any thing that ſhews he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Tranſubſtantiation. We muſt afterwards diſcuſs age after age, what the Fathers of the ſix firſt Centuries have written on it, conſult the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries which they have expreſly made on theſe words, and in ſhort en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by an attentive meditation throughly to diſcover their ſenſe. But to lay aſide the Apoſtles, and the firſt ſix Centuries, to begin this enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry after the ſimple and natural impreſſion which theſe words have made in mens minds by the 7th. and 8th. following ones. 'Tis as if a man ſhould go out of <hi>Paris</hi> to learn the news of <hi>France,</hi> in the furthermoſt parts of that Kingdom. But 'twill be reply'd, theſe Centuries were not prepoſſeſſed by our Diſputes: I grant it. But they may have had other prejudices which have diſturbed this ſimple and natural impreſſion which we ſeek. What likelihood is there of finding it pure, according as we deſire it, in <hi>Greece,</hi> ſince the fancies of <hi>Damaſcen</hi> have been in vogue, whom the Greeks eſteem as another S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> according to Mr. <hi>Arnaud;</hi> but whom Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> durſt not follow himſelf no more than we, whether <hi>Damaſcen</hi> believed the aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Bread, or only the union of it to the Body of Chriſt in the manner I have proved and explained? How can it be expected to be found pure amongſt the Copticks, Armenians, Jacobites, Neſtorians, Egyptians, ſince theſe people have fallen into ignorance, groſs Errors and Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wherein they ſtill remain. A man that is acquainted with the Hiſtory of the Emiſſaries ſent from the Latins into all theſe Countries ſince the 11th.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41961:247"/> Century till this time without intermiſſion, may not he juſtly ſuſpect that the Emiſſaries have troubled the purity of this Impreſſion? Howſoever it cannot be denied but it was more pure in the ſix firſt Ages than in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ones, and conſequently that we ought not to begin our inquiries ſince that time.</p>

If they argue either to eſtabliſh their ſenſe, or ſhew that theſe words can ſuffer no other, their arguings lie in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations which are clear and intelligible: as for inſtance, the word <hi>this</hi> cannot ſignifie any thing elſe but <hi>this Bread,</hi> and that the whole propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt be taken as if our Saviour had ſaid, <hi>this Bread is my Body;</hi> and to make this propoſition intelligible, we muſt neceſſarily give it a figurative ſenſe, for one and the ſame ſubject cannot be literally both Bread and Body. I grant we muſt not Philoſophiſe on theſe words, <hi>Lazarus come forth.</hi> Neither is there ever a one of us that ſets himſelf to Philoſophiſe on 'em; we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſimply by <hi>Lazarus</hi> a perſon whom our Saviour raiſed from the dead in the very moment he called him, as God made light at that very inſtant wherein he ſaid, <hi>Let there be light.</hi> The difficulties which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> finds in our Saviours expreſſions are affected difficulties. But thoſe which ariſe from the ſenſe of Tranſubſtantiation attributed to our Saviour's words are real ones, not by abſtracted and metaphyſical arguments, but becauſe never man ſaid, <hi>this is ſuch a thing,</hi> to ſignifie that the ſubſtance of the thing which he held was imperceptibly changed into the ſubſtance of another, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane language will not ſuffer it.</p>

                                 <p>THE Author of the Perpetuity will have the ſtate of the Latin Church in the 11th. Century (when the conteſts of <hi>Berengarius</hi> hapned) to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that of the whole Church ſince the Apoſtles time. Here Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> pretends that the Churches conſent ſince the 7th. Century determines the ſenſe of the Fathers of the ſix firſt. We have likewiſe ſeen in the 7th. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter of his Book that he aſſerts that to judg rightly of the expreſſions of the Fathers of the 7th. and 8th. Centuries, we muſt ſuppoſe they conſtantly and univerſally believed Tranſubſtantiation and the Real Preſence, and that this ſuppoſition muſt determine the ſenſe of their words. What can we think of all theſe circuits, but that they are illuſions, which plainly enough ſhew that theſe Gentlemen find but ſmall ſatisfaction in their inquiries into the firſt ſix ages. Were Tranſubſtantiation and the Real Preſence apparently taught in them, what occaſion would they have of making them enter by machins, and mount up to them from the later Ages. It is then certain that theſe ways of reaſoning, theſe ſuppoſitions and arguments from the bottom
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41961:248"/> to the top, are ſo far from perſuading us what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> deſires, that on the contrary they do but more confirm us in our opinion, which is, that theſe Doctrines were unknown to the ancient Church.</p>

                                 <p>'TIS conſonant to reaſon to imagin, that in the laſt Ages the queſtion whether the Euchariſt be the ſubſtance it ſelf of our Saviour's Body, or not, having been agitated with great heat, thoſe who held the affirmative have abuſed the general expreſſions of the ancient Fathers, and endeavoured to turn them to their ſenſe. This is a thing that happens every day in the ſmalleſt conteſts, in which every one deſires to ſet off his ſentiments and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them by paſſages taken out of the Fathers to ſhelter himſelf thereby from the reproach of innovation. It is likewiſe eaſie to imagine that thoſe who but ſlightly apply themſelves to the ſtudy of Theological Points are ſoon cheated by falſe appearances. We ſee but too many examples of this. It is in ſhort eaſie to conceive that Diſciples may deviate from the Doctrine and ſenſe of their Maſters under divers pretences. The Diviſions of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in points of Religion have almoſt all of 'em hapned in this manner, the Diſciples were not content to keep pace with their Maſters but have went beyond 'em, and often overrhrown their real ſentiments under pretence of explaining and illuſtrating what they ſaid with leſs perſpicuity. When Scholars are become Maſters, they no longer look upon themſelves as Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, but Doctors, and in this quality 'tis no hard matter to comprehend they may have new notions, which they endeavour to eſtabliſh on the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of thoſe that preeeded them; and for this effect take their words in a contrary ſenſe: The people eaſily receive what their Doctors teach 'em; and as to the Doctors, there needs no great number of them in an ignorant age to introduce a novelty. One ſingle perſon may ſometimes impoſe on a whole aſſembly, and engage them into his opinions, which afterwards ſhall paſs for the true Doctrine of the Church.</p>

The firſt is to mark preciſely by reaſoning the difference of theſe expreſſions, and to ſhew they are not alike. The ſecond is to diſcern them by opinion, by a ſimple view of the mind, and by an impreſſion which makes it ſelf felt altho it cannot be expreſſed. Applying afterwards this remark to his ſubject, he ſays, that the expreſſions of the Fathers touching the Euchariſt having been taken in the ten laſt Centuries in a ſenſe of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation and reality, and the others having never been taken but in a metaphorical ſenſe, there muſt of neceſſity be a great difference between them ſeeing they have made ſuch different impreſſions, and that opinion has ſo well diſtinguiſhed them.

                                 <p>WE are agreed concerning this manner of diſcerning the expreſſions, and the things themſelves, by opinion, as well as by an exact remark of the differences which diſtinguiſh them. But if Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will make a maxim of this which may ſerve as a principle to draw thence certain concluſions, he muſt ſuppoſe that this ſentiment or opinion can never be corrupted by falſe prejudices, nor ever be deceived by eſtabliſhing imaginary differences, where there are no real ones. I grant that in the laſt Ages the expreſſions of the Fathers have been taken in a ſenſe of Tranſubſtantiation, whereas never any man underſtood thoſe which we ſay are alike but in a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical ſenſe; this is a ſign they were regarded in thoſe Ages as diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent expreſſions; but it does not follow that they be different in effect, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be ſaid that the ſentiment of thoſe Centuries is infallible. It is no hard matter to believe that men may judg rightly in reſpect of one thing, and at the ſame time fall into error in reſpect of another whatſoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity there may be between them. A man may be ſometimes miſtaken by confounding, as if they were alike ſuch expreſſions as are not ſo, and then again take for different expreſſions ſuch as be alike. As we never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the men of theſe later ages are miſtaken in all things, ſo Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> muſt not pretend they are right in every thing.</p>

Let Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> then ſhew us if he pleaſes that in the firſt ſix Ages the expreſſions of the Fathers touching the Euchariſt were taken in a ſenſe of reality and Tranſubſtantiation, and the others which we produce as being alike, in a metaphorical ſenſe, and we will ſee what uſe we muſt make of his Rule.

For why muſt theſe terms ſubſiſting, in Authors that lived ſince the ſeventh Century, with the perſuaſion of the Real Preſence, be inconſiſtent with this Doctrine in the ſix preceding Ages? And why muſt not nature which has put later Authors upon making uſe of them without prejudice to their ſentiment produce the ſame effect in the firſt Ages?

There is a difference between the expreſſions which the Fathers uſe on the ſubject of the Euchariſt, and the ſame expreſſions in Authors of later Ages. The laſt borrowing ſometimes the expreſſions of the Fathers have at the ſame time declared themſelves in favour of Tranſubſtantiation, or the Real Preſence; the former have done nothing like this. The firſt have left their expreſſions in the full extent of their natural ſenſe without any miſtruſt of their being abuſed. The laſt have commonly reſtrained and mollified them by violent expoſitions, and ſuch as are contrary to their natural ſenſe, as well knowing they may be uſed againſt themſelves. The firſt have uſed them indifferently in all occaſions, becauſe they contained their real opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the laſt have uſed 'em only accidentally as the neceſſity of their diſcourſe required. The firſt have likewiſe uſed without any difficulty other emphatical expreſſions which the laſt dared not uſe, for, dare they ſay for example what <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Gelaſius</hi> have ſaid, that the Bread lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes not its nature or ſubſtance: dared they ſay what <hi>Facundus</hi> ſaid, that, the Bread is not properly the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, but is ſo called becauſe it contains the myſtery of it? whence it appears that when they uſe any of the Fathers expreſſions, 'tis by conſtraint, becauſe they muſt endeavour to accommodate, as much as in them lies, their ſtile to the ſtile of the Ancients, whereas the Ancients delivered themſelves in a natural manner. We muſt then make another judgment of theſe expreſſions when we find them in the Fathers, than when we meet with 'em in Authors of later Ages ſince Tranſubſtantiation has been eſtabliſhed. There they explain the real Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Church, here they are expreſſions which are endeavoured to be linked with another Belief, which is expounded in another manner. There they muſt be taken in their natural ſignification, here in a forced and forein one.</p>
                                 <p>THE natural ſenſe of theſe words of <hi>Juſtin, Ireneus, Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and ſome others, that the Euchariſt, <hi>is not mere Bread, common Bread,</hi> is, that it is in truth Bread, but Bread that is Conſecrated. The ſtrained ſenſe of theſe words is, that 'tis only Bread in appearance, and in reſpect of its accidents.</p>
                                 <p>THE natural ſenſe of theſe words which are frequently uſed by the Fathers, that our Lord <hi>called the Bread</hi> his Body, <hi>that he gave to the Bread the name of his Body, that he honored the Bread with the name of his Body. That our Saviour made an exchange of names, giving to the Bread the name of his Body, and to his Body that of the Bread.</hi> Their natural ſenſe is, I ſay, that the Bread without ceaſing to be Bread, has aſſumed the name of Chriſt's Body; the forced ſenſe is, that the Bread takes the name of it, becauſe the ſubſtance is really changed into the ſubſtance of this Body.</p>
                                 <p>THE natural ſenſe of the paſſages of the Fathers which aſſert the Bread and Wine are <hi>ſymbols, ſigns, figures, images</hi> of our Lords Body and Blood, is, that by the conſecration the Bread and Wine are exalted to the glory of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41961:250"/> the myſtical ſigns of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, without loſing their own nature. The forced ſenſe is either that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is the ſign of it ſelf, or that the accidents, that is to ſay, the appearances of Bread and Wine, are ſigns.</p>
                                 <p>IT is the ſame in reſpect of other expreſſions of the Fathers which the modern Doctors have endeavoured to accommodate to their ſtile, in giving 'em ſtrained ſenſes and forced explanations which were unknown to the Ancients. To take from us the liberty of making uſe of them, we muſt firſt be ſhew'd that the Fathers themſelves have taken them in this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and diſtorted ſenſe. Otherwiſe we ſhall ſtill have reaſon to uſe them according to their natural and ordinary one.</p>

He propoſes it in theſe terms, <hi>That the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks have right to ſuppoſe without any other proofs that the paſſages of the Fathers are to be underſtood in the ſenſe wherein they take 'em, and that all the Anſwers of the Calviniſts in which they eſtabliſh not theirs by evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations are ridiculous and unreaſonable.</hi>

Chapters. The reſult of all which amounts only to this, That the Diſpute being reduced to the expounding of certain terms which the Catholicks take in one ſenſe, and the Miniſters endeavour to turn into another, the Catholicks ſtopping at the <hi>literal</hi> ſignification of theſe expreſſions, that they take the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, for the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and the change of the Bread into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, for the change of the Bread into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. But that the Miniſters hereto apply one of their two general ſolutions, or famous keys of <hi>virtue</hi> and <hi>figure</hi> ſo often uſed by them. That in this conteſt 'tis evident that the right of the ſuppoſition belongs to the Catholicks. The other thing is, that the expreſſions which the Catholicks alledg for themſelves have been taken in the ſenſe wherein they uſe them this thouſand years by all Chriſtians in the world.

I ſay the firſt is invalid; for if the Doctors of the Roman Church do propoſe ſeveral paſſages wherein they ſtop at the literal ſignification of the terms, as be thoſe which call the Euchariſt the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſome few others that ſay the Bread is changed: we alſo on our parts alledg an infinite of others, wherein we likewiſe ſtop at the <hi>literal</hi> ſignification of the terms, ſuch as be all thoſe that call the Euchariſt after the Conſecration, <hi>Bread and Wine,</hi> and which ſay that this Bread and Wine are made the ſigns, the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols, the figures of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. So far matters are equal, and the prejudice cannot favour either ſide.</p>
                                 <p>MOREOVER, who told Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> we muſt ever prejudicate in favour of the literal ſignification of terms? We oft prejudicate on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in behalf of the metaphorical ſignification by conſidering the matter to which the terms are applied when 'tis likely they are uſed figuratively; as when in matter of Books we ſpeak of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Images we ſpeak of S. <hi>Stephen</hi> and S. <hi>Chriſtopher.</hi> It is not enough to ſay the Catholicks ſtop at the literal ſignification of terms. This is not enough to eſtabliſh a prejudice, nor for the obtaining a right to ſuppoſe without proof; it muſt be moreover ſhew'd that the ſubject or matter in queſtion does not oppoſe it ſelf againſt this prejudice. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> muſt proceed farther, and ſhew that there's not any thing abſolutely that is able to form a contrary prejudice. But Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> was unwilling to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this diſcuſſion, becauſe of its difficulty; and difficulties are not proper for a man to meddle withal that writes in a domineering ſtile.</p>
                                 <p>THE ſecond reaſon has leſs ſtrength than the firſt. For firſt 'tis not true that the expreſſions which thoſe of the Roman Church alledg in their own favour have been taken in the ſenſe wherein they employ 'em for near a thouſand years by all the Chriſtians in the world. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> muſt not be ſo haſty to make us receive this propoſition till he has heard what I have to ſay. Now that things are cleared up in this reſpect, every man may judg of 'em, and I hope they will make a juſt judgment of them. Secondly, there's a great deal of difference betwixt the Fathers of the firſt ſix Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and thoſe of the later Ages, who take theſe expreſſions we are ſpeaking of in a ſenſe of the Real Preſence and Tranſubſtantiation. We find in theſe laſt other expreſſions which clearly manifeſt their thoughts. They plainly ſay that the ſubſtance of Bread is changed into the ſubſtance of Chriſt's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and that this Body is ſubſtantially preſent under the vail of accidents; but we do not find any thing like this in the Fathers. Now this difference overthrows Mr. <hi>Arnauds</hi> prejudice, for had the Fathers meant by their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral expreſſions the ſame thing which theſe laſt do, they would have ſpoke like them, but this they have not done. 'Tis not then likely they had the ſame ſenſe; and it will ſignifie nothing to ſay that that which has hindred them from doing ſo was becauſe there was no conteſt in the Church all that time touching this point; for the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation does of it ſelf form, without the help of any conteſt, the diſtinct idea of a real converſion of the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine into the ſubſtance of our Lords Body and Blood. This Doctrine naturally makes a particular and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41961:251"/> ſenſe, where the term of ſubſtance enters. There's no need of a diſputation for this. Whence it follows that had the Fathers thus meant it, they would have explained themſelves in the ſame manner as theſe laſt. It does not appear to us they have done it. It is not then reaſonable to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicate they held this Doctrine.</p>
                                 <p>THE better to acknowledg the unreaſonableneſs of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions, who will ſuppoſe at any rate; oppoſe we againſt him a contrary pretenſion, which is, that we have right to ſuppoſe without any other proof, that the paſſages of the Fathers which are offered us, muſt not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in a ſenſe of Tranſubſtantiation nor Real Preſence; and that if Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will eſtabliſh the affirmative, he is obliged to do it by evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations ſufficient to vanquiſh this prejudication. This here is our pretenſion; it remains only now to be obſerved how we prove it: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeeen how Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has proved his, it will be eaſie to compare proof with proof, and judg which of the two propoſitions is the moſt juſt and reaſonable.</p>
                                 <p>FIRST, there ought to be remembred here what I ſaid in the 7th. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter of this Book touching the 7th. and 8th. Centuries, that we muſt ever prejudicate in favour of nature and common ſenſe, which regulate the judgments of men, till the contrary does evidently appear. Now the ſtate of nature is, not to believe the Doctrines we ſpeak of, and it muſt be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me that common ſenſe does not teach 'em. We have then right to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe without proof, that the Fathers did not believe them, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that their expreſſions muſt not be taken in this ſenſe: And 'tis Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi>'s part to ſhew ſo clearly the contrary, that his proof may ſurmount the prejudication. Which if he does not do, reaſon obliges us to let the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alone in the ſtate of nature and common ſenſe.</p>
                                 <p>SECONDLY, The matter in debate does of it ſelf form our preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. The point in hand is touching a Sacrament, and in Sacramental ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions we commonly give to the ſigns the names of the things which they repreſent; as may be verified by numberleſs inſtances. We then have right to ſuppoſe without any other proof, that thoſe of the Fathers concerning the Euchariſt being of this number muſt be taken in the ſame ſenſe as the others, till it be ſhew'd us ftom the Fathers themſelves that they otherwiſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood them.</p>
                                 <p>IN the third place, our right is grounded on the nature of the Doctrine it ſelf, about which we diſpute. For the ſubſtantial converſion makes of it ſelf a particular ſenſe, it anſwers to a very diſtinct queſtion, which is, whether the change which happens in the Euchariſt be a change of ſubſtance or not; it ſays, that 'tis a change of ſubſtance. It is impoſſible but thoſe that have this Doctrine in their thoughts muſt conceive it in this determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that is to ſay, in applying their conceptions preciſely to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and 'tis not likely they have thus conceived it without explaining themſelves ſometimes in a manner that anſwers exactly to their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is then reaſonable to ſuppoſe without any other proof, that they have not thus conceived it till ſuch time as it ſhall pleaſe Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to convince us of the contrary from their own declarations, not from general expreſſions, but by expreſſions which are formal and particular, or ſuch equivalent ones as may prevent a mans being miſtaken in them.</p>
                                 <pb n="109" facs="tcp:41961:251"/>
                                 <p>MOREOVER, It cannot be denied that Tranſubſtantiation of it ſelf is a hard matter to be believed, and that humane nature is naturally averſe to the belief of it. What likelihood is there then if the Fathers deſigned to teach it they ſhould be content with theſe general expreſſions which ſix not the mind being as they are, capable of ſeveral ſenſes? Had they no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear leſt humane inclinations would be apt to turn peoples minds on the other ſide, and carry 'em off from the true ſenſe of their words.</p>
                                 <p>IN fine, we need only conſider the greateſt part of thoſe expreſſions themſelves which are propoſed, to prejudicate according to appearance that they ſignifie nothing leſs than Tranſubſtantiation or the Real Preſence. For they can no ſooner have this ſenſe given 'em but they become immediately difficult and perplexed, whereas in taking them otherwiſe they become eaſie and intelligible. What can there be for example more perplexing than this uſual propoſition of the Fathers, <hi>That the Bread and Wine are the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> if a man takes it in a ſenſe of Tranſubſtantiation? For what muſt we conceive by this Bread and Wine? Is it real Bread, and real Wine? They are not the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. Are they the appearances of Bread and Wine? How can theſe appearances be this Body and Blood? Is it that which appears to be Bread and yet is not ſo? But why muſt not that be Bread which appears to be Bread? Why if it be not Bread is it called Bread? Is it that which was before Bread and Wine? But how is that which was before Bread and Wine now the Body and Blood, ſeeing there is no common ſubject of which we can rationally ſay, that it was before Bread and Wine, but now Body and Blood. After this rate a man knows not on which ſide to turn himſelf, whereas if you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that the Bread and Wine are the Sacrament of Chriſt's Body, you'l meet with no difficulty; for the Sacraments uſually aſſume the names of the things of which they are Sacraments: and theſe ways of ſpeaking create no trouble to amans mind. Now when we contend about two ſenſes, our reaſon will lead us to prejudicate in favour of that which is the moſt eaſie, and leſs intricate, and make us ſuppoſe it without proof, till ſuch time as it evidently appears that the other, (altho more difficult) yet is the trueſt.</p>
                                 <p>COMPARE now (I pray) our pretenſion with that of Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> and judg which of the two is the moſt juſt and natural. He grounds his on two reaſons whoſe ſtrength and truth we queſtion, and have already over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown; and I ground mine on Principles which muſt be granted by both parties, and which are apparently concluſive. For it cannot be denied but we muſt prejudicate in behalf of nature, of common lights which regulate the judgments of men, the manner of the Sacramental expreſſions, and the moſt eaſie and leaſt perplexed ſenſe. Neither can it be denied that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Doctrine in queſtion guiding men of it ſelf to explain themſelves about it in preciſe terms, and indeed neceſſarily obliging them by reaſon of the natural repugnancies of mens minds, does not entirely favour this preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication. It is then a thouſand times more rational than the other.</p>
                                 <p>Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D</hi> grounds his pretenſion on an advantage which we are in poſſeſſion of as well as he. For he ſays he underſtands the expreſſions of the Fathers which are alledged, in a literal ſenſe; we ſay the ſame in reſpect of thoſe which we alledg: but I ground mine on particular advantages to which he cannot pretend. Now 'tis far more reaſonable to eſtabliſh a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular right on particular advantages, than to eſtabliſh it on a common
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41961:252"/> thing. For from that which is common to both parties, there can ariſe no particular privilege.</p>

                                 <p>ALTHO we have this right to ſuppoſe without any other proof that the expreſſions of the Fathers which the Roman Church alledges in her own favour muſt be taken in a Sacramental ſenſe, and not in a ſenſe of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation or Real Preſence; yet in the anſwers we make, we do not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely make uſe of this right. For before we return our anſwers we eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the real ſentiment of the Fathers by authentick paſſages taken out of their Books, ſo that our Anſwers be only an application of that which the Fathers themſelves have taught us. Thus has Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi> uſed them, and thus have I uſed them againſt the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> There is then a great deal of injuſtice in Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s proceeding, when he produces ſome of my Anſwers, and offers 'em to be conſidered diſlocated from my proofs; whereas they ought only be conſidered in their reference to theſe proofs, from which they draw their light and ſtrength.</p>
                                 <p>FOR example, when I anſwered the paſſage of S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> taken from <hi>Theodoret</hi>'s Collections, which bears, <hi>That Hereticks receive not the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt</hi> 
                                    <note place="margin">Anſwer to the <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> part 2. ch. 2.</note> 
                                    <hi>and the Oblations, becauſe they do not acknowledg the Euchariſt to be the Fleſh of our Lord that ſuffered for our ſins,</hi> I ſaid that <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s ſenſe was, <hi>That our Saviour did not adopt the Bread to be his Body, as if he had no real Body, which was the fooliſh imagination of thoſe Hereticks; as appears by</hi> Tertullian'<hi>s Diſputes againſt</hi> Marcion, <hi>but that the Bread is the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this true Body, which died and roſe again.</hi> This Anſwer is grounded on the expreſs Declarations of the Fathers, which I had already produced, and which ſhew they meant by the term of Fleſh, or Body of Jeſus Chriſt applied to the Euchariſt, not the ſubſtance of this Fleſh, but the Sacrament or Symbol of it, which is in it ſelf Bread. To take this Anſwer alone ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the proof which authoriſes it to declaim afterwards, that I return Anſwers without grounding them on proofs, is a thing that is neither ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt nor ingenuous. Moreover, what I ſaid touching theſe Hereticks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving our Saviour Chriſt adopted the Bread for to be his Body, as having no true Body of his own, is grounded on <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s attributing this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Marcion,</hi> who (as every one knows) follow'd in this the ancient He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks; and 'tis to no purpoſe to ſay, <hi>That thoſe that taught this ridiculous adoption of the Bread received the Euchariſt, and that S.</hi> Ignatius <hi>ſpeaks on the contrary of Hereticks that did not receive it.</hi> For 'tis certain that theſe ancient Hereticks ſtill retained ſome uſe of the Euchariſt, celebrating it in their manner, but did not receive it according to the juſt and true deſign of its inſtitution, which is to repreſent and communicate to us the true Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, who ſuffered death and is riſen again, becauſe they denied our Saviour aſſumed real Fleſh, affirming he appeared in the world only in a phantaſm. If Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will conteſt hereupon, beſides that I can tell him my Anſwer will be no leſs good, in the main, when he ſhall ſhew that the Hereticks mention'd by <hi>Ignatius</hi> did abſolutely reject the Euchariſt, I may moreover oppoſe againſt him Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> who expreſly ſays touching this paſſage, <hi>That theſe ancient Hereticks combated not ſo much the</hi>

                                    <hi>Sacrament of the Euchariſt, as the myſtery of the Incarnation; for as</hi> Ignatius <hi>himſelf inſinuates the reaſon of their denial of the Euchariſt to be our Lords Fleſh, was, becauſe they diſown'd our Lord aſſumed true Fleſh;</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>

                                 <p>THE ſame thing may be ſaid touching the Anſwer I return'd to a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage <note place="margin">Anſwer to the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> p. 2. ch. 2.</note> of <hi>Juſtin,</hi> which ſays, <hi>That we take not theſe things as mere Bread and Drink, but that this meat being made the Euchariſt, with which our fleſh and blood are nouriſhed, by means of the change becomes the Fleſh and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt incarnate.</hi> I anſwer'd not barely what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> makes me anſwer, <hi>That this food is made the Body of Chriſt by a Sacramental union to the Body of Chriſt,</hi> but <hi>that in effect the Euchariſt is not common Bread and Drink, but a great Sacrament of our Lords Body and Blood, which is celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in remembrance of his taking on him our nature, it being honored with the name of Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt according to the very form of our Lords own expreſſions.</hi> I at the ſame time grounded this Anſwer on <hi>Juſtin</hi>'s very words, and 'tis moreover eſtabliſhed on the proofs which I had already alledged touching the ſenſe of the Fathers, when they call the Euchariſt the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. Yet has Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> been pleaſed to ſay, <hi>That my ſence is without proof and Authority, contrary to the Letter and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,</hi>

                                 <p>HE does the ſame in reference to the anſwers I returned to the paſſages of <hi>Gelazus, Cyzique,</hi> and <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> for whereas I have backt them with arguments drawn from the paſſages themſelves, and that they have moreover their foundation on the proofs I offer'd in the beginning of my Book. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> recites of 'em what he pleaſes, and ſeparates that which he relates of 'em from their true Principle. Whoſoever ſhall take the pains to read only what I wrote touching theſe two paſſages in the ſecond Chapter of my Anſwer to the ſecond Treatiſe, and the ſecond Part, and eſpecially touching that of <hi>Cyril</hi> in the ſixth Chapter of the aforeſaid ſecond Part, and compare it with all theſe Diſcourſes which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> here gives us, that is to ſay in the fifth Chapter of his tenth Book, I am certain, will not like his proceedings, finding ſo much paſſion and ſo little ſolidity in his Diſcourſes.</p>

                                 <p>SEEING Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is ſo kind to people as to preſcribe 'em after what manner they ſhall preſent themſelves before him, without doubt he expects they will henceforward obey him in this particular. Yet muſt I tell him, I have reaſon to ſuppoſe without any other proof, that there is not in the Holy Scripture any <hi>formal declaration</hi> touching the Doctrines of Tranſubſtantiation, and the Real Preſence; nor are they <hi>diſtinctly aſſerted in them.</hi> Every body knows in what terms <hi>formal declarations</hi> muſt be conceived, and in what manner Doctrines muſt be clearly and diſtinctly expreſt. If Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has diſcovered in the Scripture any particular matter in relation to this ſubject, let him communicate it to us. But if he knows no more than we have ſeen hitherto, we ſhall ſtill have reaſon to ſay that the Doctrines in queſtion are not formally declared in them.</p>
                                 <p>IT cannot be denied but theſe words, <hi>This is my Body</hi> are capable of the ſenſe which we give them. Whether it be the true one or no I will not here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; 'tis ſufficient the words will bear it, to conclude they are not a formal diſtinct declaration of Tranſubſtantiation nor the Real Preſence, ſeeing what we call a formal declaration cannot be capable of a ſenſe contrary to that which we pretend it formally eſtabliſhes. 'Tis to no purpoſe for Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to ſay that <hi>Luther</hi> found them evident; for beſides that he found no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in them for Tranſubſtantiation, but only for the Real Preſence, with which he was much prepoſſeſſed. One may oppoſe againſt <hi>Luther</hi>'s preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, the judgment which Cardinal <hi>Cajetan</hi> made of them who has found no <note place="margin">Cajetan. in 3.

                                 <p>AS to the words of the 6th. Chapter of S. <hi>John,</hi> ſo far are they from being formal declarations touching Tranſubſtantiation and the Real Preſence, that a great many of the Doctors in the Roman Church have not ſtuck to affirm that theſe words do not at all relate to the Sacrament of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> reckons up ſix beſides others, namely, <hi>Biel, Cuſanus, Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>

                                    <hi>Tapper, Heſſelius, and Janſemius,</hi> but Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi> has computed 'em to be about thirty three, which is in my mind ſufficient to make Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> comprehend, that this Chapter is not ſo formal, nor evident for theſe Doctrines as he imagines. I ſhall not here take notice of what he alledges concerning thoſe words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> That ſuch as eat of this Bread and drink of this Cup unworthily, are guilty of our Lords Body and Blood.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41961:253"/> If he takes theſe words for an evident declaration, it is yet more evident that he is miſtaken. To be guilty of our Lords Body and Blood ſignifies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Fathers to be a murderer of our Saviour, to be of conſent with the Jews, that crucifi'd him. This is not very formal for Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</p>
                                 <p>WHAT he ſays touching <hi>Zuinglius</hi> is not at all to the purpoſe, <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius</hi> was not ignorant of the ſenſe of our Saviours words, but he was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the examples of like phraſes which are in Scripture. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> mentions this only that he might bring in again this black or white Spirit, of which we have already diſcourſed, not only from paſſages out of <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Catullus,</hi> but alſo out of <hi>Apuleus,</hi> and S. <hi>Jerom</hi> himſelf; ſo that this muſt be lookt upon as impertinent and tireſome. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s paſſion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in appears in that <hi>Zuinglius</hi> having only ſaid that ſome body appear'd to him in a dream to advertiſe him, <hi>viſus eſt monitor adeſſe,</hi> he will needs have this <hi>monitor</hi> to be a Spirit. Neither is there leſs ignorance in raiſing from a proverbial way of ſpeaking in the Latin tongue, <hi>ater fuerit an albus nihil memini,</hi> which ſignifies that we know not a man, we never ſaw his face, rhis propoſition, <hi>That he knew not whether 'twas a white Spirit or a black one.</hi> Cannot Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> better ſpend his time than in hunting after theſe trifles?</p>
                                 <p>BUT ſays he, <hi>The firſt idea of our Saviours words touching the Euchariſt is very favourable to the Catholicks.</hi> It is favourable by an effect of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, I grant. But let a man take off this vail from his mind, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to himſelf our Saviour in his natural Body on one ſide, and the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtical Bread on the other, two viſible objects really diſtinct and locally ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from one another, and judg in this caſe whether the firſt idea of theſe words rather refers to a Tranſubſtantiation of one of theſe objects into the other, or to a Sacramental ſenſe. The firſt idea from words does not always ariſe from the literal ſignification of them, but from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in queſtion, and circumſtances of a diſcourſe. And this is that which forms the firſt idea, as may be juſtified by infinite inſtances, ſhould Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> queſtion it. Now 'tis certain that in reſpect of our Saviours words all theſe things do joyntly concur to give them naturally a myſtical or figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative ſenſe.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>ALL Nations,</hi> ſays he, <hi>have taken them in this ſenſe.</hi> All Nations, that is to ſay, the Latins ſince <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. and <hi>Innocent</hi> III. and yet not all of them neither. This is a ſuppoſition which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will have right to make when he can better prove it. But ſuppoſing it were true as he would make the world believe, that ſince a thouſand years all Nations took them in this ſenſe, it will not hence follow that this was the firſt idea of theſe words, nor that the Roman Church has right to ſuppoſe without any other proof, that her Doctrine is clearly contained in the Scripture. For it is poſſible for all Nations to fall into an error touching the ſenſe of certain words, be engaged in it through ſurprizal, and afterwards remain therein by prejudice and intereſt. And in this caſe every man ſees that this pretended clearneſs which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> boaſts of cannot be juſtly ſuppoſed.</p>
                                 <p>IN fine, ſuppoſing 'twere true the firſt idea of theſe words was very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that all Nations ſince a thouſand years followed this firſt idea, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> could not hinder me from ſaying there is not in the Scripture any formal declaration touching Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41961:254"/> and the Real Preſence. And this he well knew himſelf. But that he might take his full carier, he imagin'd 'twas his beſt way in reciting the paſſage of my Anſwer, on which he grounds his invective to eclipſe theſe expreſſions from it, <hi>by ſome formal declaration of his word,</hi> becauſe 'twould appear that my ſenſe in 'em is that the Doctrines of the converſion and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Preſence are not taught in expreſs terms in the Holy Scripture, nor are to be drawn thence by neceſſary conſequences, which is moſt true. <hi>Who</hi>

'Tis by virtue of the ſame right that he thought he might lay aſide that which I added to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of this paſſage. <hi>Say what you will of it, I cannot believe but this ſilence diſquiets you, eſpecially if you conſider that there is in the New Teſtament four different occaſions wherein according to all appearances Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation and the Real Preſence were to be found</hi> DISTINCTLY AS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SERTED.

                                 <p>Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D</hi> is not content to gather for himſelf alone the fruits of his victories, he is willing to bring in the Sociniens for a ſhare with him, and his conceptions on this ſubject are remarkable. I brought ſome proofs drawn from Scripture touching the Trinity to ſhew in what manner this myſtery is aſſerted in the word of God. <hi>Theſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>are only ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without proof.</hi> This is certainly abſurd enough to call proofs, and ſuch <note place="margin">Ch 6. p. 44, 45.</note> proofs too as are drawn from Scripture ſuppoſitions without proof. <hi>They would be,</hi> ſays he again, <hi>very rational in the mouth of a Catholick, becauſe be accompanies theſe proofs, with the publick ſenſe of the whole Church and all Tradition; but theſe ſame proofs are extremely weak in the mouth of a Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt, without authority and poſſeſſion, and who renounces Tradition and the Churches Authority.</hi> This propoſition ſurprizes me. The proofs of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture touching the myſtery of the Trinity will be of no validity, but weak
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41961:254"/> proofs in their own nature without the benefit of Tradition, and all their evidence and ſtrength muſt depend on the publick ſenſe of the Church; <hi>Hoc magno mercentur Atridae. The Arians and Sociniens are much obliged to Mr.</hi> Arnaud. But this was not S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> ſentiment, when diſputing againſt <hi>Maximus</hi> an Arian Biſhop, he told him, <hi>I muſt not alledg to you the Council</hi>

But proceed we on the authority of Holy Scripture which is a common witneſs for us both, oppoſe we Cauſe to Cauſe, and Reaſon to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> Should Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Principle take place, S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> would have been guilty of a great imprudence thus to lay aſide the publick ſenſe and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and wholly betake himſelf to the Holy Scripture, ſeeing the proofs taken thence concerning the Trinity, are <hi>weak,</hi> yea even <hi>infinitely weak,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from Tradition and the Churches Authority. What anſwer will Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> make a Socinien when he ſhall ſay we muſt not value this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſenſe, and Tradition, which is in it ſelf grounded on weak proofs. For after all, why has the publick intelligence taken the paſſages of Scripture in this ſenſe, if the proofs of this ſenſe are ſo ſlight in themſelves. 'Tis nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther raſhly nor enthuſiaſtically, nor without juſt grounds that Tradition is to be found on this ſide. But what are the reaſons of it, if the proofs drawn from Holy Scripture, to ground this ſenſe on, are in themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme weak? Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does not conſider that he not only gives the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciniens an unjuſt advantage, but likewiſe ruines himſelf his own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as faſt as he thinks he eſtabliſhes it.</p>
                                 <p>HE ſays, <hi>that I ſuppoſe my paſſages concerning the Trinity are unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi> When a Socinien ſhall reply thereunto, we ſhall have enough to ſhew that his anſwers are vain, and yet I ſhall have right to ſuppoſe the ſolidity of my proofs till theſe pretended replies come. He adds, <hi>That I ſuppoſe the Sociniens object not any contrary paſſage.</hi> Which is what I do not ſuppoſe, but I ſuppoſe they cannot object any, that can prevail over thoſe I offer'd. I have reaſon to ſuppoſe it without being obliged to diſcuſs either their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers or objections. If Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s obſervations muſt be a rule, why has he contrary thereunto wrote this 10th. Book, which is only grounded on a ſuppoſition. He ſuppoſes the conſent of all Chriſtian Churches in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Tranſubſtantiation and the Real Preſence, imagining he has well proved them. But I need only mind him of his own remarks, and tell him he ſuppoſes. 1. That his proofs are unanſwerable. 2. That we will not offer contrary ones againſt them, and conſequently his ſuppoſition is faulty. If he anſwers it belongs to me to make my replies, and produce my obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and that till then his ſuppoſition holds good, let him take the ſame anſwer from me on the ſubject here in queſtion.</p>
                                 <p>HE ſays in fine, <hi>That I ſuppoſe reaſon remains neuter, contenting it ſelf without teaching the Trinity, and approving on the contrary certain truths which have a natural coheherence with that particular one, that I ſuppreſs this infinite crowd of difficulties, wherewith reaſon furniſhes thoſe againſt this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, who take this dangerous way whereby to judg of the myſteries of Faith.</hi> A man that ſo confidently blames ſuppoſitions ought not to make ſuch a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible one as this is, without grounding it at leaſt on ſome proofs, <hi>That rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon furniſhes us with an infinite crowd of difficulties againſt the Article of the Trinity.</hi> The objections made againſt this myſtery proceed either from the weakneſs or corruption of reaſon, rather than from reaſon it ſelf; and I
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41961:255"/> confeſs there are of this kind, not a crowd of difficulties as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerates it, but ſome, that may perplex a mans mind. So likewiſe did I never ſuppoſe this Article was wholly exempt from 'em; I have on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary formally acknowledged them. But to ſay no more, there needs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be read what I wrote on this ſubject to find, that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> could not worſe diſengage himſelf from this part of my anſwer, having left it untoucht in its full ſtrength. Eſpecially let any one read the places wherein I eſtabliſh by Scripture the Divinity of the three perſons, and eſpecially that of our Lord and Saviour, and judg whether 'tis wiſely ſaid, <hi>That I ruin the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niens without redemption, but 'tis by ſuch a way, as will rather make them laugh, than change their minds.</hi> This diſcourſe is not very edifying, and is perhaps capable of a ſenſe which will not be to Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s advantage.

                                 <p>WE grant there is a difference between the neceſſary conſequences of a Doctrine and that which we call the conſequences of congruity, which are not of abſolute neceſſity. But to make a good uſe of this diſtinction, it muſt be attended by theſe following obſervations. 1. That the arguments drawn from the conſequences of congruity, have more or leſs force, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the conſequences themſelves have more or leſs natural coherence with the Doctrine in queſtion. 2. That when a conſequence ſeems to be natural, and is confirmed moreover by experience, it is not enough for the refuting the Argument drawn thence barely to ſay that 'tis only a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of congruity, which has not an abſolute neceſſity. We muſt either oppoſe againſt it contrary proofs that are ſtronger, and which cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by theſe ſort of Arguments taken from conſequences, how natural ſoever they may appear to be, or oppoſe againſt them a contrary experience, or give a reaſon why theſe conſequences cannot take place, and by this means diſcover the obſtacles which have impeded them. 3. That the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument becomes very ſtrong when 'tis drawn from a great number of theſe conſequences, it being very unlikely but nature has produced her effect in reſpect of ſome of 'em. 4. That when the natural conſequences of a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine do not appear at certain times, or in certain places, there muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in at leaſt appear other equivalent ones which are inſtead of thoſe, it being ſcarcely poſſible for nature to remain abſolutely without effect.</p>
                                 <p>TO apply now theſe obſervations to the Miniſters way of arguing, I I ſay that 'tis a natural conſequence of the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation to find contradictions in mens minds, and produce Diſputes and Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies amongſt them, experience confirms it ſince the 11th. Century to this preſent. We may then draw a great proof that the ancient Church held not this Doctrine, in that ſhe remained in peace concerning this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, till <hi>Paſchaſius</hi>'s time, altho there were otherwiſe, Controverſies touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt all the Articles of the Creed. 'Tis not ſufficient for the relating
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41961:255"/> of this Argument to anſwer as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does, that this is only a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of congruity, and <hi>that 'tis natural enough for people not to riſe up againſt this Doctrine when the cuſtom of Faith has ſuppled mens minds into do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility towards this myſtery.</hi> I will anſwer him that 'tis not at all natural to ſuppoſe this docility in all mens minds for eight hundred years together in relation to this Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, that 'tis on the contrary very natural not to ſuppoſe it to be in all, and that that which he calls the cuſtom of Faith, does not uſually incline mens minds to this docility till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeveral contradictions and repugnancies, as appears by the example of all the Articles of the Chriſtian Religion which have this difficulty. He muſt then offer againſt this Argument ſtrong and convincing proofs, by which it may appear that the ancient Church held this Doctrine, or inſtance in ſome Doctrines as difficult as Tranſubſtantiation, that were never controverted; or in fine give a reaſon why this conſequence which ſeems to be ſuch a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral one, yet has had no place during eight hundred years.</p>
                                 <p>'TIS alſo a conſequence natural enough of Tranſubſtantiation, that 'tis endeavoured to be eſtabliſhed by ſenſible Miracles; for Miracles are one of of the chief inſtruments by which mens minds may be mollified towards this docility of Faith which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> mentions. Experience confirms this ſince <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> his time to this preſent. We may then very well argue in this manner, and conclude that theſe Miracles appearing only ſince the 9th. Century, 'tis moſt probable that was the time wherein Tranſubſtantiation came into the world. And 'tis not ſufficient for the confuting of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſay this is not a conſequence abſolutely neceſſary; for altho this be true, yet that is a conſequence natural enough, being grounded on expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
                                 <p>IT is moreover a conſequence natural enough of Tranſubſtantiation, and confirm'd by experience not to expoſe the proper ſubſtance of Chriſt's Blood to the inconveniencies which attend the cuſtom of communicating of both kinds, and conſequently not to admit people indifferently to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the Cup. As we find not this conſequence in the firſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, and it appearing in the latter, we may make hence a probable conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture concerning the change that has been introduced in reſpect of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. For 'tis not likely that during ſo long a time men were not troubled with theſe inconveniencies which are ſo ordinary, and reſolved at length to remedy them. <hi>To ſay,</hi> hereupon, <hi>that they communicated of both kinds to imprint more deeply the Death of Chriſt in the minds of the Communicants by the repreſentation of the ſeparation of the Body and Blood,</hi> is as much as amounts to nothing; for the reaſon of the inconveniencies is far ſtronger than this other contrary reaſon: as appears by the example of the Roman Church ſince the Council of <hi>Conſtance.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>A MAN may likewiſe ſtrongly argue from the common practices of the Roman Church, by which ſhe ſhews that ſhe adores the Sacrament with an adoration of <hi>latria,</hi> hereby to declare that the Greek Church does not adore it, ſeeing ſhe has none of theſe cuſtoms. For altho each of theſe practices had only a link of ſimple congruity with the Doctrine of the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, yet is it no ways likely but the Greek Church would practiſe ſome of 'em, or at leaſt others equivalent to 'em, that are as ſignificant to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie openly the acts of Adoration. This then is no ſatisfactory anſwer, but a mere evaſion to ſay that theſe are only conſequences of congruity.</p>

We make uſe of theſe proofs on the queſtion, Whether the ancient Church believed Tranſubſtantiation, to ſhew ſhe did not believe it; or on the queſtion which reſpects the Schiſmatical Churches, to ſhew that they hold not Tranſubſtantiation neither, nor adore the Sacrament. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to touch on theſe proofs whilſt he treated on theſe queſtions, he has reſerved himſelf to refute them by way of conſequence in his 10th. Book, wherein he ſuppoſes the conſent of all Nations ſince the 7th. Century to this preſent. Whereas we ſay for inſtance, That the Greeks do not believe Tranſubſtantiation, becauſe we find not among them the conſequences of this Doctrine. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> perverts this order, and ſays, That our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments drawn from theſe conſequences are invalid, becauſe the Greeks who believe Tranſubſtantiation according to the ſuppoſition which he makes of 'em admit not theſe conſequences. I confeſs this circuit is a very dexterous one, but by how much the greater art there is in it, by ſo much the more plainly does he diſcover the ſtrength of our Arguments, ſeeing Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is forced to elude them in this manner.</p>

                           <p>The ſtate of the Queſtion touching the diſtinct knowledg of the Preſence, or Real Abſence.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>DESIGNING particularly to treat in this 6th. and laſt Book of the Change which has hapned (according to us) in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Church, I could not better begin it than by the queſtion, Whether men ever had a diſtinct knowledg of the Preſence or Real Abſence. This diſtinct knowledg being one of the principal means which the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> has made uſe of to ſhew that the change which we ſuppoſe is impoſſible, it is neceſſary then to conſider it firſt. 'Tis likewiſe for this reaſon that I reſerved the diſcuſſion of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s 6th. Book for this place; for having treated of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity's</hi> method, I believed 'twas neceſſary to diſcuſs without interruption whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever concerned the Greeks and other Eaſtern Chriſtians, to examin at the ſame time the ſtate of the Latins in the 7th. and 8th. Centuries, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards paſs on to the Conſequences which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> draws from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended conſent of all Churches in the Doctrines of Tranſubſtantiation. Which done, due order requiring us to proceed to the queſtion of the change which hapned in the 9th. 10th. and 11th. Centuries; and this other Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of the diſtinct knowledg which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> handles in his 6th. Book, being a dependance of that of the change, or to ſpeak better, a preamble to it, I believed this was the moſt fitting place to examin it.</p>
                        <p>BUT before we enter into this matter, it is neceſſary to ſtate the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on clearly, and for this effect I ſhall propoſe ſome remarks which will plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcover wherein conſiſts the point of our difference. Firſt, I grant Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> that the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> has not offer'd his Argument drawn from the diſtinct knowledg, but only in reſpect of the Real Preſence, and not in reference to Tranſubſtantiation. But Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> likewiſe muſt grant that this proof does not fully anſwer the deſign which the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> propoſed to himſelf at the entrance of his Treatiſe, <hi>To make</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Perp. Faith, pag. 14.</note> 
                           <hi>us confeſs from the evidence of truth it ſelf, that the Belief of the Roman Church touching the Myſtery of the Euchariſt is the ſame with that of all anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> For the Roman Church does not ſimply ſtop at the Real Preſence,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41961:257"/> ſhe believes likewiſe Tranſubſtantiation. Now in this reſpect that Author's proof concludes nothing. Yet ſeeing he himſelf has reſtrained his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment only to the Real Preſence, it will not be juſt to give it a greater extent in this reſpect.</p>
                        <p>IN the ſecond place it muſt be granted that the queſtion here concerns nor perſons that have no knowledg of Chriſtianity, and conſequently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps never heard of the Euchariſt nor Body of Jeſus Chriſt. The point in hand concerns perſons that made open profeſſion to be Chriſtians, who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, and knew that our Saviour Chriſt is in Heaven, ſo that they had ſome kind of notion as well of the Euchariſt as of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. So far Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> and I agree well enough.</p>
                        <p>BUT our difference begins from the complaint I make againſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> in that he would eſtabliſh the ſtate of this queſtion in an illuſory manner. <hi>It concerns us,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to know whether the faithful</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Refutation, Part. 2. Ch. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>could remain for the ſpace of a thouſand years in the Church without forming a diſtinct and determinate notion, whether what they ſaw was or was not the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> maintains this ſtate of the queſtion, <note place="margin">Lib. 6. cap. 3.</note> and I affirm 'tis wholly captious, and that the queſtion does not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern this matter. Which we ſhall illuſtrate by a third remark. I ſay then the queſtion is properly to know whether during a thouſand years the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that were in the Church ever formed a diſtinct and determinate notion, whether what they ſaw was or was not the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſubſtance, without ever ceaſing during all this time to have this ſame no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thus diſtinct and determinate. The Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> are obliged to prove the affirmative, becauſe in their reſpect 'tis a neceſſary propoſition which they offer in form of a Principle, wirhout which their Argument touching the impoſſibility of the change concludes nothing. I muſt defend the negative, but this negative conſiſts not in affirming that during a thouſand years the faithful could remain without forming this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and determinate notion here in queſtion, it conſiſts in affirming only that during a certain time comprehended within the extent of theſe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years the people have not formed this diſtinct notion. Theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens affirmation muſt be general for the thouſand years, and if there be wanting but one, or leſs than one Age, their ſuppoſition will be ineffectual, ſeeing 'tis only by this they can prove that the change we diſpute about was impoſſible during theſe thouſand years. But as to my own part, 'tis ſufficient I affirm their ſuppoſition to be falſe during a certain time wherein the change will be made. It will do theſe Gentlemen no harm, perhaps, who ſcoff at that <hi>Philoſophy</hi> which they call School-boys Exerciſe, to conſult it ſometimes; for it will teach them to diſtinguiſh between a contrary oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a contradictory one. Two contrary propoſitions may be both of 'em falſe, and are never very proper to form a juſt ſtate of a queſtion between rational perſons who diſpute to find a Verity, and not to diſcover two fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities. For example theſe two propoſitions, <hi>Men are lyars. Men are always lyars,</hi> are oppoſite by an oppoſition called contrary. They are both falſe and cannot form a juſt queſtion. To form it there muſt be made this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory oppoſition. <hi>Men are not always lyars, men are ſometimes lyars;</hi> or, <hi>men are always lyars, men are not always lyars, they are ſometimes true.</hi> That man will juſtly render himſelf ridiculous, who having offer'd this propoſition, <hi>That during a thouſand years men always ſpake the truth;</hi> and attempting to maintain it, ſhall afterwards give an exchange, and ſay
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41961:257"/> the queſtion is, <hi>Whether men could remain a thouſand years without ſpeaking any truth.</hi> He may be well told this is impertinently ſtated, and that this is not the point in hand, but only to know whether they always ſaid the truth during a thouſand years without ceaſing ever to ſpeak it, or whether they have been ſometimes lyars. This inſtance alone exactly diſcovers the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity's</hi> illuſion, who having offer'd this propoſition, <hi>That the faithful ever had a diſtinct knowledg whether the Euchariſt was or was not the Body of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that is to ſay, the proper ſubſtance of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; for 'tis thus he underſtands it, has afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the ſtate of the queſtion in theſe terms, <hi>It concerns us to know whether the faithful could remain a thouſand years in the Church without forming a diſtinct and determinate notion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

                              <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether that which they ſaw was or was not the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> We have juſt cauſe to tell him that this is not the point, but whether they always were in a condition to form this diſtinct notion, or whether ſometimes they were not.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D</hi> endeavours in vain to excuſe the Author of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity,</hi> that he only eſtabliſhed this ſtate of the queſtion on the very terms of my anſwer. For ſuppoſing it were true that the terms of my Anſwer furniſhed him with an occaſion or pretence for this, yet muſt he not thus eſtabliſh it to the prejudice of the publick intereſts which require a man to proceed right on in a Diſpute, to find the truth, and not to amuſe ones ſelf in deceitful and fruitleſs conteſts, and prove things which will ſignifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Now this is what the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> has done, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> likewiſe by means of this falſe ſtate of the queſtion, as will appear if we conſider that when they have proved moſt ſtrongly and ſolidly, and in the moſt convincing manner imaginable, <hi>That the faithful could not remain a thouſand years in the Church without forming a diſtinct and determinate notion, whether that which they ſaw was, or was not the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which is a propoſition contradictorily oppoſite to that which they expreſs in their ſtate of the queſtion, they will do nothing in order to the clearing up of our difference. We diſpute whether the change which the Proteſtants ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe be poſſible or not. Now to prove that 'tis impoſſible by the Argument of the diſtinct knowledge, it ſignifies nothing to ſhew that the faithful could not remain a thouſand years in the Church without forming this diſtinct no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now in queſtion. For they might remain only a hundred years in it, fifty years, thirty years, without forming it; this is ſufficient to invalidate their proof, and give way to the change which we pretend. To ſhew it is impoſſible that a man has entred into a houſe, it is not enough to prove that the door of this houſe could not remain open for ten years together; it muſt be ſhew'd that it was always kept ſhut. For if it has been left open only one day, the proof concludes nothing. It is then evident that theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen beat the air, and that whatſoever they built on their ſtate of the queſtion, is only an amuſement to deceive ſilly people. Whence it follows that perſons of ſenſe may juſtly complain of them, in that they have made my words, be they what they will, a pretence whereby to entertain the world with fruitleſs diſcourſes.</p>
                        <p>BUT moreover 'tis certain that the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted my words and ſenſe. 'Tis true that in the fifth Obſervation of my firſt Anſwer I eſtabliſhed this general Principle, <hi>That error and truth have equally two degrees, the one of a confuſed knowledg, and th'other of a diſtinct one, and that 'tis hard to diſcover any difference betwixt them, whilſt they are</hi>
                           <pb n="122" facs="tcp:41961:258"/> 
                           <hi>in this firſt degree of confuſed knowledg, unleſs a man comes to the other, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a diſtinct knowledg: that the ideas are ſo like one another that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily diſcern them.</hi> It is true that from this Principle I generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, <hi>That before an Error becomes famous by its being oppoſed, the greateſt part of the Church content themſelves with holding the truth in this indiſtinct degree I now mention'd, and ſo it is eaſie for a new Error to inſinuate and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle it ſelf in mens minds under the title of an illuſtration of the ancient truth.</hi> It is moreover true that in applying this Principle I added theſe terms. <hi>To apply this to the matter which we treat of, I ſay that before Tranſubſtantiation came into the world, every one believed our Saviour to be preſent in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and that his Body and Blood are really therein received by the faithful Communicant, and that the Bread and Wine, are the ſigns and memorials of his Death and Paſſion on the Croſs; this was the Faith of the whole Earth; but I ſhall not be miſtaken when I ſay, there were few that extended their thoughts ſo far as to obſerve exactly the difference of the two Opinions, which do at this day ſeparate the Reformiſts, and Romaniſts, there were alſo ſome who knew the truth only in general. When then error came in thereupon, and building ill on a foundation, declared we muſt underſtand our Saviour is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Euchariſt ſtubſtantially and locally, that his Body and Blood are received in it by the mouth of our bodies, and that the ſign of his Body is his Body it ſelf, this was without doubt in effect an extraordinary novelty, and of which there was never heard any mention; but yet I do not find it ſtrange that ſeveral people were deceived by it, and took this not for a novelty, but as an illuſtration of the common Faith.</hi> So far extends my fifth Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
                        <p>BUT he ought not to ſtop here to raiſe a ſtate of a queſtion, he ought to ſee likewiſe what I add immediately after in the ſixth Obſervation. Had the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> conſulted it, they would have acknowledged that I gave therein a formal explication, and as it were a limitation to this general Principle which I laid down, that this does not wholly take place in enlightned Ages wherein there are eminent Paſtors for knowledg that take care to inſtruct clearly their Flocks in the truths of Faith. For then their good inſtructions hinder the growth of Error, and render people capable of knowing and rejecting it. But it is wholly applicable to the Ages of darkneſs wherein Ignorance and Superſtition have corrupted the Church. Which I expreſs in theſe words, <hi>Which will without doubt better appear if for a ſixth remark we caſt our eyes a little on the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this change has moſt advanced it ſelf. It was not in</hi> Hilaries <hi>nor</hi> Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius's <hi>times, nor in that of</hi> Ambroſe <hi>and S.</hi> Auſtin, <hi>but in the 10th. and 11th. Centuries, that is to ſay in the moſt dark Ages,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>'Tis no marvel then that Error made ſuch conqueſts in thoſe times, rather will it be a greater wonder if ſhe did not.</hi> And this diſtinction (methinks) does ſufficiently limit my Principle. To eſtabliſh ſincerely the ſtate of our queſtion theſe two remarks muſt not be ſeparated, but joyn'd together to draw from them my whole ſenſe, for the ſtate of the queſtion in my reſpect depends on my entire ſenſe. Now my whole ſenſe does not conſiſt only in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Principle which I lay down, nor in the general application I make of it, but in the exception and limitation I give them, But neither has Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> nor the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> dealt thus, chooſing rather to run af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their own chimerical notions than to follow the truth.</p>
                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:41961:258"/>
                        <p>MOREOVER, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſhews he has but little to ſay, when he ſets himſelf on reproaching me, that I ſuppreſſed ſome words of my fifth Obſervation; 'tis not likely I would on purpoſe ſuppreſs words contained in my Book, which might be eaſily found in turning over ſome leafs. If I paſſed over 'em 'twas becauſe they made no more to the ſubject than thoſe which I recite, which contain the whole ſubſtance of my diſcourſe, and which are no leſs ſignificant than the others. But I know not whether he can ſo well juſtifie the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> in his making me ſay, <hi>That the Church remained in this ignorance till</hi> Berenger's <hi>time,</hi> altho there's no ſuch <note place="margin">Lib. 6. cap. 3. p. 577.</note> thing in my Book. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s anſwer is, that the Author of the <hi>Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity</hi> repreſents my ſenſe, and not my words; and becauſe that this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which this Author imputes to me is ſet down in Italick letters, which are thoſe which are uſed for Quotations in proper terms. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſays that 'tis the Printers fault who ought to Print them in a Roman letter. I will believe it becauſe he ſays ſo, but yet my ſenſe ought to be faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and for this effect plain dealing requires it to be drawn from my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs declarations, contained in ſeveral paſſages of my firſt and ſecond An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, rather than from a diſcourſe that is maim'd and which cannot repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in this condition but half of that which I would ſay. Whatſoever pains the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> have taken to diſguiſe my ſenſe, Father <hi>Maimbourg</hi> the Jeſuite, who wrote ſince Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly perceived and related it as it is in truth. <hi>Mr. Claude,</hi> ſays he, <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">A Peaceable Method by Father <hi>Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> ch. 3. page 108.</note> 
                           <hi>there was</hi> A CERTAIN TIME <hi>wherein through the neglect of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, Chriſtians had no more than a confuſed knowledg of this myſtery, without poſitively believing or rejecting either the Real Preſence, or abſence, becauſe they ſtudied not the point.</hi> This is in effect my meaning, and not that which the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> imputes to me, that the Faithful could remain a thouſand years in the Church without forming a diſtinct notion, whether what they ſaw was or was not the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>THE firſt of theſe three Remarks I now made, conſiders the point in reſpect of the Doctrine now in queſtion, and determines it to the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence alone, excluding Tranſubſtantiation. The ſecond conſiders it in reſpect of the perſons, and determines it to the Chriſtians only, excluding thoſe that have no knowledg of our Myſteries; and the third conſiders it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the time, and determines it to the Ages of Ignorance and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: that is to ſay, to thoſe wherein, according to us, the change was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, which are the 9th. and 10th. and part of the 11th. For altho, according to the exact rigour of the Diſpute the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> be obliged to prove his Theſis from the time of the Apoſtles to that of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renger;</hi> yet there being only to ſpeak properly theſe three Ages in queſtion in this Diſpute, we ſhall neither complain of him, nor Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> when they ſhall reſtrain their Argument to theſe.</p>
                        <p>IT remains only now to know in what diſpoſitions of mind we muſt ſuppoſe the Chriſtians were; when we imagin the Doctrine of the Real Preſence was declared to 'em; for on this depends the queſtion, Whether the change which we pretend was poſſible or impoſſible?</p>
                        <p>BUT before we enter upon this enquiry, 'tis neceſſary to make two far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Obſervations. The firſt is, that the queſtion is not whether the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of that time had knowledg enough to diſcover in ſome ſort, when the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41961:259"/> Doctrine of the Real Preſence was propoſed to them, that it agreed not with the Principles of nature; but whether in ſuppoſing they believed not this Doctrine, they had knowledg enough to diſcover 'twas an innovation, contrary to the Churches Faith and to reject it under this conſideration. For for to conclude that people would have actually oppoſed the Real Preſence had they not before believed it, it is not enough to ſhew, that it would have oppoſed their ſenſes and notices of reaſon. I confeſs that if men did always what they ought to do, this alone were ſufficient to put them upon reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting this Real Preſence, as we have elſewhere proved it. But people are liable to be deceived, and receive notwithſtanding the contradictions of ſenſe and common reaſon, that which they are perſuaded is a myſtery of Faith, and generally as ſoon as ever they begin to conſider it as a myſtery, they hearken no longer to ſenſe nor reaſon. We ſhould then proceed, and ſhew that they were in a diſpoſition to reject this Doctrin as a novelty, which the Church never held, and which conſequently was not a true myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Faith.</p>
                        <p>THE other obſervation which we muſt make, is, that we ought to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the belief of the Real Abſence in the ſenſe in queſtion, from the belief of the corporeal Abſence. To believe the corporeal abſence, is to form to a man's ſelf the idea of the ordinary and natural preſence of a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body, ſuch as is that of our Saviour's, and to reject it as falſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant. But to believe the Real Abſence in the terms of our Diſpute, is to conceive the idea of an inviſible Preſence, ſuch as the Roman Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives and rejects as an error. A man may reject the ſubſtantial Preſence of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in the Euchariſt under the notion of the ordinary exiſtence of a body in a place, and yet not reject it, either generally under every notion, be it what it will, nor in particular under the notion of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible exiſtence, after the manner of a Spirit; as appears from the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Roman Church, which does not believe this ordinary and natural Preſence, but yet admits the inviſible one. It would have been well if the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> had not uſed in this Diſpute theſe equivocal terms of the Real Preſence, and real Abſence, which give way to ſophiſms, as will appear in what follows; but ſeeing he has uſed them, it is at leaſt neceſſary to diſtinguiſh them, as I have now done.</p>
                        <p>LET us ſee then upon theſe illuſtrations what are the pretenſions on either ſide. The Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> maintains that theſe Chriſtians muſt have a diſtinct knowledg either of the Preſence or Real Abſence, that is to ſay, they muſt have known diſtinctly whether that which they receiv'd in the Communion was or was not the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in ſubſtance; for thus he underſtands it, there being no medium ſays he. I affirm on the contrary that they had not for the moſt part of 'em any diſtinct knowledg either of the inviſible Real Preſence, or the Real inviſible Abſence; and that they were not come as then to this diſtinct queſtion. Whether the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Jeſus Chriſt was inviſibly preſent by its proper ſubſtance, and after the manner of a Spirit in the Euchariſt or not.</p>
                        <p>SO far it ſeems that the method and ſtate of this Diſpute is clear, for 'tis likely by the Real Preſence the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> means not the viſible Preſence, of which we do not diſpute, and which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf rejects, but the inviſible Preſence of which we diſpute, and which the Roman Church holds; ſo that we need only propoſe the proofs of both
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41961:259"/> parties for the Readers edification. But Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> who can make clouds when he has occaſion for 'em, has ſo greatly obſcured this matter by diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and crafty pretences, that we muſt ſtill ſpend more time to clear the difficulties he has caſt in our way.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>TO believe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Real Abſence is to believe that the Euchariſt is not</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 6. cap. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, or that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is not really preſent in the Euchariſt. Now a man may diſtinctly believe or know that one thing is not another, or that 'tis not in another in three different manners. The firſt by an expreſs and formal reflection, but general when a man generally denies one thing to be another, or affirms that 'tis abſent but without ſpecifying any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner. Thus in denying the King to be at</hi> Paris, <hi>we ſay he is not there in any real manner, altho we ſpecifie not any one. The ſecond by a diſtinct re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on all the different manners of being a thing, or being really preſent in a place. Which is as if a man ſhould ſay that the King is not at</hi> Paris <hi>neither viſibly nor inviſibly; and 'tis in this manner the Sacramentaries deny the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt's Body in the Euchariſt. And the third without any reflection, and by a ſimple view of the nature of things which does ſo comprehend the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of whatſoever belongeth not to their being, that the mind knows as well what they are not, as if it had made an hundred poſitive judgments on 'em.</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying afterwards this diſtinction he aſſures us firſt, <hi>That the Author of the</hi> Perpetuity <hi>never pretended to prove that if the Faithful believed not the Real Preſence, they then believed the Real Abſence in the ſecond manner, which is to ſay, that they poſitively excluded, by a formal reflection, all the ſeveral kinds of preſence, 2. That the greateſt part of his Arguments conclude, that if the Faithful believed not the Real Preſence they would have rejected it in the firſt manner, and by a general reflection which denies the thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſidering the different ſpecies. 3. That altho a man may draw this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence from ſeveral of his Arguments, yet 'tis ſufficient for his deſign to ſhew that theſe Faithful would have rejected the Real Preſence in the third manner, that is to ſay, without reflection, and by a diſtinct knowledg of certain verities which include it according to the ordinary manner of conceiving things.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>WE muſt then examin theſe three manners, and ſee in what ſenſe the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> is obliged to maintain that if the Chriſtians of whom we ſpeak believed not the Real Preſence, they then believed the Real Abſence.</p>
                        <p>THE firſt is chimerical and impoſſible. For 'tis not poſſible for a man naturally to conſider the Real Preſence of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in the Euchariſt to reject it; without conceiving at the ſame time in particular, ſome kind or manner of preſence. Either theſe perſons, to whom Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> attributes his firſt manner of believing the Real Abſence, knew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Preſence, or did not know it. Suppoſing they knew it, what neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity was there of making them reject it in general, without ſpecifying it in particular? Why not ſay, they rejected it in making a formal reflection on it? If they knew it not, as it ſeems Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſuppoſes, it is not at leaſt poſſible but they had formally in their minds the particular idea of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal and viſible Preſence. For as ſoon as ever we conceive a humane Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be ſubſtantially preſent in a place, the firſt notion that offers it ſelf naturally to the mind is that of the ordinary and corporeal Preſence. It is poſſible we may conceive a humane body without thinking of the place wherein it is, we every day make ſuch kind of abſtractions as theſe, yet
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41961:260"/>
'tis not poſſible according to nature for a man to conceive it to be preſent by its proper ſubſtance in a place without conceiving at the ſame time the idea of its corporeal Preſence. Nature furniſhing us with no other idea of the ſubſtantial Preſence than that, it cannot be, but this idea will ſhew it ſelf to the mind, as ſoon as ever we imagin a body in a place. To be preſent in a place, and that corporeally, are naturally one and the ſame idea in reſpect of a humane body. The Philoſophy of later Ages has made two ideas of this, whether with reaſon, or not, I do not now diſpute; but howſoever, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes but one of it, and whilſt we do not diſtinguiſh them, nor know the ſecret of making two ideas of them, the one general, and th'other particular, we ſhall never make this abſtraction, for nature puts not men upon making it. Now we ſpeak here of perſons that think according to nature, and ſuppoſe they never heard the leaſt mention of inviſible and incorporeal Preſence, it is not then poſſible but they muſt immediately form the idea of the viſible or corporeal Preſence, in the ſame manner as 'tis not poſſible for a man naturally to conceive the Sun to be preſent over our He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphere, but he muſt conceive the idea of his viſible and ordinary Preſence. It is then certain that a man conſidered in the ſtate of nature, void of the fancies of this new Philoſophy cannot believe the Real Abſence of Chriſt's Body in the Sacrament, without thinking on the corporeal Preſence. In this condition he can underſtand no other than that, and 'tis it which he rejects, becauſe 'tis on it whereon falls the firſt conception of his mind. This will yet farther appear if we conſider that the eyes of a Communicant will determin his thoughts to the corporeal Preſence, when of it ſelf it were not therein determined; for 'tis not poſſible for a man who never heard of the ſpiritual and inviſible Preſence to raiſe in his mind, at the ſame moment wherein he communicates this queſtion, <hi>Is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſent in this Euchariſt which I receive?</hi> but that he muſt at the ſame time uſe his eye-ſight, to inform himſelf. This inclination is ſo natural that if he does not follow it, it muſt neceſſarily be ſaid that he has in his mind the idea of an inviſible Preſence, of which his eyes cannot be witneſſes, and that 'tis this idea which diverts him from having recourſe to his ſight; and if he does follow it, his eyes which tell him that it is not therein derermin his thoughts to the idea of the corporeal Preſence to make him reject it.</p>
                        <p>BUT is it impoſſible that a man in conceiving the idea of the corporeal Preſence, and in rejecting it, ſhould conceive at the ſame time that there may be invented other manners of a ſubſtantial Preſence, but muſt reject them all, be they what they will, without ſpecifying or conſidering them. I anſwer, that in this caſe he will conceive theſe other manners of preſence in oppoſition to the corporeal and viſible one, and conſequently will ſpecifie them at leaſt as incorporeals and inviſibles, and conceive them under this quality, In a word, when nature offers us but the idea of one ſingle ſpecies, there ariſes not up immediately a general conſideration in our minds, our fancy leads us to that particular ſpecies, and if afterwards we conceive any other, 'tis always in oppoſition to that which nature it ſelf offers to our knowledg. Whence it follows that this firſt manner of believing the Real Abſence by a general rejection of every kind of preſence, yet without ſpecifying ſo much as any one in particular neither viſible nor inviſible, is a mere chimera which reſides only in Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s brain.</p>
                        <p>AS to the third it is moreover invalid and illuſory, ſeeing it anſwers not the deſign of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> For as we have already ſaid,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41961:260"/> he is obliged to ſhew, that if people had not believed the Real inviſible Preſence, they would have had in their minds, diſpoſitions, and prejudices, which would have made them reſpect it not barely as a Doctrin that appears contrary to natural reaſon, (this is not ſufficient to produce actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an entire rejection and oppoſition when the matter concerns a point of Faith) but as an innovation in the Churches Belief. Now this third manner of believing the Real Abſence without any reflection by a bare view of the nature of things, in the ſame manner as we know <hi>Paris</hi> is not <hi>Rome,</hi> nor <hi>France Holland,</hi> that the Sun is not the Moon, nor an Houſe an Elephant, thar the Kings Picture is not the King himſelf, to uſe Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s examples, without having made this expreſs and formal reflection; this manner I ſay, may make men capable of knowing that the Real Preſence is contrary to the order of nature, that it agrees not with common ſenſe, but not make 'em diſcern whether it be a myſtery of the Churches Faith (as 'tis ſaid to be) or whether 'tis a new humane invention. This ſimple view of the nature of things which conſiſts in knowing, that the Euchariſt is Bread, that the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt is an image of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, that this Body is a humane Body, and that 'tis in Heaven, does not hinder a man from being ſurprized with the matter of novelty, by being perſuaded that 'tis the true Doctrin of the Church (as 'tis aſſured to be) and on this perſuaſion Reaſon muſt yield to Faith.</p>
                        <p>'Tis in vain, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> tells us, <hi>that ſuppoſing the Faithful had no other</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 6. cap. 2. pag 564, 565.</note> 
                           <hi>than theſe ſimple notions, that the Sacrament of the Euchariſt is Bread and Wine, which repreſent to us the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, ſuppoſing they conceiv'd the Body of Jeſus Chriſt to be in no wiſe therein, that they imagin'd this Body to be only preſent in Heaven, and that all the uſual expreſſions form'd only in their minds the idea of a figurative Preſence, they would immediately have judg'd that the belief of the Real Preſence was falſe and impertinent; as we would immediately judg that man who would perſuade us that</hi> Paris <hi>is</hi> Rome, <hi>or that the Popes Picture is the Pope himſelf, or that the ſeven ſtalks of Corn which</hi> Pharaoh <hi>dreamed of were really ſeven years, or the Paſchal Lamb a real paſſage, and Sacrifices for Sins real Sins, to be mad and ſenſleſs.</hi> When a man judges of theſe things he ſimply judges of them according to the light of nature, and 'tis certain the light of nature will render that man im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent who ſhall ſay what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> makes him ſay. It would be the ſame concerning the real inviſible Preſence, ſhould a man judg of it on this ground. But thoſe that offer it in any age oppoſe againſt the light of Nature the ſplendid name of the Churches Faith. They endeavour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate it under the pretence of its being a myſtery of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which has been always believed, and for this purpoſe they ſpare no colours. By which means they ſtop the courſe of nature, and hinder men from judging according to its Principles, reducing the queſtion to know whether it be true that this be the Faith and perpetual ſenſe of the Church, by which means 'tis no hard matter t' impoſe on the ignorant.</p>
                        <p>'TIS moreover in vain that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> brings in the Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. for an inſtance, which all the Pariſians know to be only Braſs, and that his body is only at S. <hi>Dennis.</hi> He ſays, perhaps they never thought of formally rejecting the opinion that this Statue is really the Body of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and yet be ready to oppoſe this opinion, ſhould any extravagant perſon offer to make them believe it. But howſoever the Pariſians ſtand affected towards the Statue of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. there's a great deal of difference between
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:41961:261"/> this example and that of the Euchariſt here in queſtion. The Statue of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. is a work of humane inſtitution, wherein men ſuppoſe there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſupernatural; whereas the Euchariſt is a Divine myſtery, in which there has been always believed to be ſomething above nature. The Statue of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. is a thing abſolutely popular, concerning which every man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves he has liberty of judging according to the principles of Senſe and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The Euchariſt is a myſtery which has been endeavour'd to be made long ſince in ſome manner inacceſſible to mens curioſity, by concealing it under a cloud of Ceremonies. <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth was indeed a great Prince, whoſe memory will never die; but how great ſoever he deſervedly was, yet is he conſider'd only as a man whoſe body lies interred at S. <hi>Dennis</hi> in the ſame manner as others do. Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, whoſe Body is living, and glorious, and hypoſtatically united to the Divinity. Should any man then imagin that the Statue of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. is really <hi>Henry</hi> IV. I doubt not but people would look upon him as a mad man, becauſe 'twould be conſidered according to the light of nature as a thing touching which there can be nothing that's extraordinary and miraculous conceived, which is expoſed to the knowledg of all the world, and wherein there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all that's Divine. Neither do I doubt but ſuch a dotage would be rejected as a novelty unknown to our Fore-fathers, becauſe 'twould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that our Fore-fathers had their ſences made as ours, and that in reſpect of natural and ſenſible things their judgments have been the ſame as ours, nature ever remaining in a uniform ſtate. But neither this example nor th'others which are like it do ſignifie any thing in reſpect of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt which is a myſtery of Faith, wherein all Chriſtians agree that there's ſomething ſupernatural, altho they agree not in the manner. A myſtery concerning which every man does not think he can ſafely judg, much leſs from the principles of Senſe and Reaſon: in fine, a myſtery of the Son of God, the knowledg of which depends on a light which is not always equal. It is then manifeſt that neither this example nor the reſt of the ſame rank pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> are pertinent.</p>
                        <p>NEITHER is it leſs clear from what I now repreſented, that of theſe three manners of believing the Real Abſence, which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> propoſes, there's only the ſecond which can be admitted into this Diſpute, to regulate the ſtate of the queſtion, becauſe the firſt, as I have ſhew'd, is impoſſible, and the laſt can yield no advantage to the Author of the <hi>Perpeuitty</hi>'s deſign.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D</hi> may here again call to mind the ſolidity of the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which I made touching the two expreſſions which are very like one another, as to terms, but very different in ſenſe, <hi>not to believe, or not to know that a thing is, and to believe, or know that a thing is not.</hi> The firſt denotes a bare negation of Knowledg, and the ſecond a poſitive act of Knowledg and Faith, which formally denies the exiſtence of a thing. <hi>Not to believe the Real Preſence,</hi> barely ſignifies that this preſence is not held for an Article of Faith; <hi>but to believe that the Real Preſence is not,</hi> ſignifies ſomething more, which is, that a man reckons it among the Articles which he rejects. The Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> having ſaid that there's no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium <note place="margin">The firſt Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity.</hi>
                           </note> between having a diſtinct knowledg of the Real Preſence, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a diſtinct knowledg of the Real Abſence, I had reaſon to tell him, that to make in this matter an immediate oppoſition, he muſt make it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory, and not contrary, that is to ſay, he ought to bring in an affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or the negation of the ſame thing, and not the affirmation, or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:41961:261"/> rejection, that he muſt ſay the Chriſtians have had a diſtinct belief of the Real Abſence, or that they have not had it; and not ſay they have had a diſtinct belief of the Preſence, or Real Abſence.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D</hi> calls this <hi>School-boys Philoſophy.</hi> But this School-boys <note place="margin">Lib. 6. cap. 2. pag. 5.</note> Philoſophy, ſeeing he pleaſes to give it this name, is grounded on common ſenſe. For common ſenſe ſhews us that to make an immediate oppoſition we muſt ſet the negative on one ſide, and the affirmative on the other. <hi>We grant,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to Mr.</hi> Claude, <hi>that to ſpeak logically we ought to oppoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Real Preſence, and not believing the Real Preſence, and not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Real Abſence. But I affirm, that to ſpeak rationally we may well op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe believing the Real Preſence, and believing the Real Abſence; which is to ſay, that not to believe the Real Abſence, and to believe the Real Abſence, may and ought to paſs for the ſame thing in the point in queſtion, becauſe theſe two diſpoſitions of mind have all the ſame effects.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I HAVE been ignorant till now of the diſtinction between ſpeaking logically, and ſpeaking rationally; for I always thought that true Logick, which tends only to cultivate our reaſon, and which explains it ſelf clearly and intelligibly, had not any other language than what was rational. But not to ſtray from our ſubject, if in the matter in queſtion, theſe two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, <hi>not to believe the Real Preſence, and to believe the Real Abſence,</hi> muſt paſs for one and the ſame thing, it follows they are both of 'em equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rational at bottom. Seeing then they are both of 'em equally intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and equally popular, why did not the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> make uſe of the firſt, rather than the ſecond. For the firſt being as it is rational, intelligible, and popular as well as the other, it has moreover this advantage that Logick approves of it, whereas ſhe rejects the other. The firſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion does of it ſelf explain juſtly and naturally what a man would ſay, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more nor leſs; whereas the other, according to Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment is equivocal, and does not explain what's meant, but only becauſe of the matter in queſtion. The firſt is liable to no conteſt. The ſecond is diſputable. Wherefore then has not Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> knowing them to be equivalent, left the ſecond to make uſe of the firſt. He had loſt nothing, if it be true, they both ſignifie one and the ſame thing, and he had ſpared the pains of a new diſpute. For I maintain againſt him, that neither ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſpeaking, nor logically, theſe two expreſſions ought to paſs for the ſame thing. The firſt cannot produce the effect which the ſecond produces, ſeeing the ſecond will make men oppoſe the Real Preſence as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation which Faith rejecteth, whereof the firſt cannot of it ſelf work ſuch en effect. A man that is perſuaded the Real Preſence is a Doctrin which he ought to reject, will oppoſe himſelf againſt it, as ſoon as ever it ſhall be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd him. A perſon that never heard it mention'd will eaſily ſuffer himſelf to be ſurprized when told this has been ever the Faith of the Church.</p>
                        <p>WHEREIN conſiſts then you'l ſay the point of our difference, and what is the ſtate of this queſtion? It may be eaſily gather'd from what I have now ſaid, which is to know whether the people of the 9th. 10th. and 11th. Ages, in ſuppoſing the Real Preſence which was taught them, that is to ſay, the inviſible ſubſtantial Preſence, ſuch as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holds at this day; for 'tis on that we diſpute, was a novelty, which yet was taught them as the ancient Faith of the Church. I ſay, the queſtion is, whether theſe people had notions and prejudices in their minds, which muſt of neceſſity
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41961:262"/> make them reject this Doctrin as a novelty contrary to the ancient Faith, even ſo far as to oblige 'em plainly and openly to oppoſe it. And becauſe theſe prejudices can be no other than this diſtinct belief, <hi>That the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is not ſubſtantially preſent in the Euchariſt, neither in a viſible nor inviſible manner,</hi> it concerns us to know whether one may rationally ſay in the terms of our ſuppoſition that they had this diſtinct belief. It lies upon Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to prove the affirmative, and I the negative. This is the true ſtate of this queſtion, as appears from what we have ſeen in this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter. But becauſe Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has ſo openly and plainly renounced this manner of believing the Real Abſence by a formal reflection on the ſeveral kinds of preſence, whether viſible or inviſible, it may be reaſonably ſaid this is no longer a matter of conteſt between us. I grant him (if he will) that people have poſitively rejected the corporeal and viſible Preſence of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in the Euchariſt, and that in this ſenſe they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved a Real Abſence. I grant likewiſe if he will that theſe ſame people were in a capacity to know, that the light of nature oppoſes the Doctrin of the ſubſtantial and inviſible Preſence. He grants me for his part, that it does not appear they were for poſitively rejecting, and by a formal reflection this incorporeal and inviſible Preſence. Wherein then do we diſagree? 'Tis clear that that which I grant him is not a ſufficient diſpoſition, whence to conclude that the people would have oppoſed the Doctrin of the inviſible Preſence as a novelty unknown to the Church. For, for to believe that Jeſus Chriſt is not viſibly and corporally preſent in the Euchariſt, this does not hinder but that a man may embrace the opinion of the incorporeal Preſence, and ſo likewiſe to know that the light of nature does not well agree with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Preſence, this does not hinder men from being deceived by imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'tis a myſtery of Faith, which the Church has always believed, and touching which a man muſt not conſult his ſenſe or reaſon. It is no leſs clear that what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> grants me is ſufficient to conclude that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple here mention'd had no diſtinct knowledg of the Real Preſence, in the ſenſe in which the Roman Church believes it, neither to admit it, nor reject it; and conſequently they had no neceſſary diſpoſition to oppoſe it when 'twas firſt taught them. For as to this general rejection, we have ſhew'd it to be chimerical and impoſſible: The queſtion is then decided, but in my favour, ſeeing the reſult of all theſe illuſtrations is, that the change which we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe has been poſſible. Yet if Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will obſtinately maintain this general manner of believing the Real Abſence, which denies every kind of ſubſtantial Preſence without particulariſing any one of them, altho we have ſhew'd him 'tis fantaſtical, and contrary to nature; yet I ſay we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that the queſtion be this, <hi>Whether the people before-mentioned ought, according to our ſuppoſition formally and generally to deny all the ſeveral ſorts of ſubſtantial preſences of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in the Euchariſt whatſoever they be, without ſpecifying any one of them.</hi> But this is what he has ſtill to prove.</p>

                           <hi>in refellendis aliis diſertos &amp; copioſos eſſe, quam in ſuis probandis certos &amp; fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos manere.</hi> Methinks the ſame may be ſaid of Mr, <hi>Arnaud.</hi> For he trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles not himſelf with proving either the propoſitions he advances, nor thoſe of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> and is never more buſied than in cenſuring the opinions of others. So greatly is he in love with this kind of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he ſcruples not many times to quit his principal ſubject, and fall upon any accidental one, provided 'twill but furniſh him with a pretence to make objections; nay, ſometimes he ſhall ſtart fancies of his own on purpoſe to give himſelf this divertiſement. Yet we muſt needs confeſs he has ſome reaſon to do thus, having a peculiar tallent of ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the moſt ſolid mattters; for ſometimes he tells me of having private Dictionaries to my ſelf, other times of Keys, and Machines, rhetorical En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſms, and a thouſand other pretty fancies, which take with his Readers, and give him, together with the benefit of ſome ſlight objections and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations thereupon, the liberty of breaking looſe through the ſtrongeſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
                        <p>AN example whereof may be ſeen in this Diſpute of the diſtinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Real Preſence, or Real Abſence. For after the illuſtrations which we have given in the preceding Chapter, 'tis eaſie to find that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ought to eſtabliſh this Propoſition: that if the people of the 9th. and 10th. Centuries had not found themſelves imbued with the diſtinct be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Real inviſible Preſence, they would have diſtinctly believed the Real inviſible Abſence, at leaſt in a general manner, that is to ſay, they would have formally rejected every kind of ſubſtantial Preſence of Jeſus Chriſt in the Euchariſt; yet without ſpecifying ever a one of them in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. He himſelf acknowledges that the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> would be underſtood to ſpeak of this general manner of believing diſtinctly the Real Abſence; ſo that it cannot be but the Readers muſt be in expectation of what he alledges for the confirming this Hypotheſis. But they will find themſelves much miſtaken, for inſtead of applying himſelf to ſtrengthen it, by new Arguments, or to maintain the Arguments of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> in reſtraining them to the time in queſtion, he has rather choſen to employ the reſt of his ſixth Book in examining the ſtate of the people of the firſt ſix Centuries, not that 'twas neceſſary to enter upon this examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeeing theſe Ages are out of the bounds of our Diſpute touching the change. But ſeeing he would only refute the five ranks of perſons whom I ſuppoſed to be in the Church before the opinion of the Real Preſence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, refute them I ſay in reference to the eight firſt Centuries to have thence occaſion to multiply his objections. I may with good reaſon be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed withal from following him; for to ſpeak properly, 'tis mere running
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41961:263"/> into fruitleſs debates. Yet to omit nothing, I will ſtill patiently hearken to what he has to ſay on this ſubject. Before I enter upon the diſcuſſion of his particular objections againſt my five ranks of perſons, 'twill not be amiſs to examin ſome of his general ones, for we muſt endeavour to ſatisfie him in all things.</p>
                        <p>FIRST then Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> makes me contradict my ſelf. He ſays, <hi>That</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 6. cap. 4. pag. 550.</note> 
                           <hi>if it be not true I admitted the confuſed Belief during ten Ages, if I inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it in the 9th. and 10th. it follows that I knew that during eight Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Faithful had a diſtinct knowledg of the myſtery of the Euchariſt.</hi> I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg this Conſequence to be juſt enough. <hi>But,</hi> adds he, <hi>Mr.</hi> Claud <hi>bethinks himſelf and finds 'tis more for his advantage to grant nothing to the Author of the Perpetuity, and even to affirm that during theſe eight Centuries the Faithful had no diſtinct knowledg of the Preſence, or Real Abſence.</hi> Why does Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> call this recollecting a man's ſelf? What contrariety is there between theſe two things? <hi>Not,</hi> ſays he, <hi>but that there's an equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all this.</hi> If there be any equivocation, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ought not to make a contradiction of it, nor ſay I am at diſcord with my ſelf. But the truth is, there is neither equivocation nor contradiction in it; for we have already told him, that to know diſtinctly the myſtery of the Euchariſt, is neither to know diſtinctly the Real Preſence, nor Real Abſence, and that there's a difference in theſe things. To know diſtinctly the Real Abſence in the ſenſe wherein we take this term in this Diſpute, is to reject formally, and by a poſitive act this inviſible Preſence as an error. But to know di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly the myſtery of the Euchariſt, is according to us, to know clearly that the Euchariſt is Bread and Wine, as to the ſubſtance of it, that by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration this Bread and Wine are made ſigns or myſtical figures of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, that this ſignification is grounded on ſeveral relations which are between the Bread and Wine, and the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, that thoſe who receive theſe Symbols with Faith and Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards Jeſus Chriſt who died for us, and roſe again, and is reigning in Heaven, they ſpiritually eat of his Body and drink of his Blood, that theſe Symbols are called the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt by a Sacramental way of ſpeech, becauſe they do both repreſent them to our Faith, or becauſe there's a great conformity between them, and the things which they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or becauſe they communicate them to us, and ſeveral other like Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. In a word, to underſtand the myſtery of the Euchariſt is to know poſitively wherein conſiſts the nature and eſſence of a Sacrament, which does not include any diſtinct knowledg either of the Real inviſible Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, or Real inviſible Abſence. I acknowledg 'tis not eaſie to ſurprize people that are in this capacity, nor perſuade them that this Real Preſence has been ever believed in the Church, eſpecially if they have Paſtors that are learned and honeſt, who acquit themſelves of their Duty, and watch diligently over their Flocks. But howſoever this is not to underſtand di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly the Real Abſence in queſtion.</p>
                        <p>IN the mean time to the end Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> may no longer equivocate on this ſubject, let me tell him, that when we attribute this diſtinct knowledg of the myſtery of the Euchariſt to the eight firſt Centuries, we would not be underſtood either that they had it in a degree always equal and uniform, or that all perſons who lived in each of thoſe Ages have been equally enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. We know the light of thoſe Ages was diminiſhed by degrees, ſo that the 7th. and 8th. had much leſs of it than the firſt ſix. We know likewiſe
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:41961:263"/> there has been always in the Church, I mean even then when 'twas moſt flouriſhing, a great number of pious Chriſtians in truth, but little advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in knowledg, and with them multitudes of prophane worldly wretches who little concerned themſelves touching what they believed of the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                        <p>IN the ſecond place Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> reproaches me with having done two things, which would be ſtrange enough were they true: the one, that I ill explain'd the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi>'s ſentiment, and th'other that I gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him in effect whatſoever he pretended to. He grounds theſe two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches on that I ſaid ſomewhere to the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity, That if</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Anſwer to the ſecond Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, part 2. chap 3.</note> 
                           <hi>he meant that the Faithful who took the inſtructions of the Fathers in a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical ſenſe, believed Jeſus Chriſt preſent corporeally in Heaven without thinking on what has been ſaid ſince, that he is at the ſame time in Heaven and on Earth, there after the manner of a Body, here after the manner of a Spirit, I acknowledged that the Faithful had in this ſenſe a moſt diſtinct idea of the Real Abſence, which is to ſay, they did not at all believe that he was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially preſent in the Sacrament, applying their whole mind to the preſence of his Grace and Merit, ſetting themſelves to meditate on his infinite love,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>without exerting their thoughts to this preſence of ſubſtance, invented of late by the Roman Church. But if by having an idea and diſtinct belief of the Real Abſence, that Author meant they knew and rejected diſtinctly this means of exiſtence of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt on the Altar, in multiplying his Preſence in ſeveral places, I affirm'd they had it not at all.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT theſe two reproaches are without grounds, for in reſpect of the firſt it appears from what we have ſeen in the preceding Chapter, that the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> muſt have pretended to that which I charge him with; to wit, that the Faithful have had the diſtinct idea of the ſubſtantial inviſible Preſence, ſuch as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believes, and that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally rejected it as an Error. For there's only this manner of believing the Real Abſence which can have place in this Diſpute, ſeeing that of the three which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has propoſed the firſt as we have ſeen, is impoſſible, and the third uſeleſs for the deſign of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity;</hi> ſo that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily his ſenſe muſt fall upon the ſecond, which is preciſely that which I have attributed to him. And as to the ſecond reproach 'tis clear, that if the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> pretended to no more than what I granted him, his Argument will fall to the ground; for it does not follow from perſons not fixing their minds on the preſence of an inviſible ſubſtance, ſuch as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teaches, and their applying themſelves only to meditate on a preſence of Grace, which is preciſely what I grant him, it does not hence follow, I ſay, that they are led by this alone to reject the Real Inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Preſence, as a novelty contrary to the Faith of the Church. There needs ſomething more than this, I mean there needs greater lights to inevitably effect this rejection. For a man muſt have for this not only the idea of this ſubſtantial inviſible Preſence, ſuch as is fancied in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but likewiſe diſtinctly know that ſuch a Preſence was never taught in the Church. For otherwiſe 'tis very poſſible that people will ſuffer themſelves to be deceived, when told the Church has ever believed ſuch a Preſence, eſpecially when they ſhall hear ſeveral paſſages out of the Fathers on this ſubject alledged in a counter ſenſe. Moreover, if Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> imagins I meant to acknowledg of my own head, that one may call the diſpoſition of theſe perſons who believe Jeſus Chriſt corporally preſent in Heaven,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:41961:264"/> (without conſidering what has been ſaid ſince of his Preſence in Heaven and on Earth at the ſame time, there viſibly, here inviſibly) believing the Real Abſence, he is groſly miſtaken. For what I ſaid was out of condeſcention, and ſuppoſition, and not abſolutely, which is to ſay, that in caſe the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> pretended only this, I would not diſpute with him about an expreſſion. In effect if we are agreed touching the thing, I'll never make war with him upon the account of terms.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D</hi> is no leſs miſtaken when he accuſed me for making an illuſory anſwer to the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> The buſineſs is, that this Author ſaid, that if the change which we pretend were true, <hi>There</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Firſt Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity,</hi> page 37.</note> 
                           <hi>muſt have been of neceſſity a time wherein the belief of the Real Preſence has been ſo mixt with that of the Real Abſence, that there were half of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Prieſts, and People, who held the one, and the other half that held the other.</hi> To this I anſwer'd, <hi>That in the times of the greateſt ignorance, even</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Anſwer to the firſt Treatiſe, page 12.</note> 
                           <hi>in the 11th. Century, I doubted not but there were four or five ranks of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Body of the viſible Church, the one profane and worldly perſons who kept themſelves at a diſtance from theſe Diſputes; others ignorant ones, who contented themſelves with knowing in general, the Euchariſt to be the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of Chriſts Paſſion, and that they receive therein his Body and Blood, theſe holding the true Faith in a degree of confuſed knowledg. The third, of thoſe that held the true Faith in a degree of diſtinct knowledg, and rejected the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Preſence. And the fourth, of thoſe that had embraced the Opinion of this Preſence.</hi> And this is what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> calls an illuſion. Whereas I affirm this anſwer is pertinent; for if there have been four ranks of men in the Church, 'tis ill done of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> to reduce them to two. But, ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> ſpeaks of the time before <hi>Berenger,</hi> and you ſpeak of the time that followed him. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> ſpeaks of the time <hi>of the chimerical</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 6. ch. 5. pag. 560.</note> 
                           <hi>growth through which the belief of the Real Preſence hath neceſſarily paſſed according to the imagination of the Calviniſts:</hi> And thus doth he formally explain himſelf. And I ſpeak of the time wherein Error made its greateſt progreſs, <hi>in the greateſt progreſs of error.</hi> Theſe are my words. So far there's nothing miſ-underſtood, we ſpeak both of us concerning the ſame time. But this time according to us is that in which <hi>Berenger</hi> began to oppoſe the Real Preſence. <hi>But,</hi> ſays moreover Mr. <hi>Arnaud, the whole Church</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Page 562.</note> 
                           <hi>had already paſſed over into the belief of the Real Preſence before</hi> Berenger'<hi>s time, and</hi> Aubertin <hi>himſelf acknowledges as much.</hi> Which is what I deny, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ought not to affirm it without proof. The greateſt progreſs of the Real Preſence was then when <hi>Berenger</hi> declaring himſelf againſt it, <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> his Diſciples maintain'd it by Diſputes; ſo that this is preciſely the time about which the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> and I debated.</p>
                        <p>THESE are the firſt objections of Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> after which he divides what he calls my Syſtem into three parts or times. <hi>The firſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Page 563.</note> 
                           <hi>the firſt eight Ages, and the five ranks whereof it conſiſts. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond contains two Centuries and an half, which a man cannot better name than the unaccountable time of the Miniſters, And the third contains the time which follow'd</hi> Berenger. 'Tis certain that of theſe three times there was only the ſecond (as I already ſaid to ſpeak properly) neceſſary to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd touching the queſtion, Whether the change which we pretend was poſſible or impoſſible. For altho I do not grant that all the Faithful of the eight firſt Centuries have had a diſtinct knowledg either of the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:41961:264"/> or Real Abſence in the ſenſe wherein the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> takes theſe terms, yet did I acknowledg there was then light enough in the Church whereby to reject the Opinion of this ſort of Preſence, had it appear'd, ſo that it does not ſeem 'twas greatly neceſſary to diſpute concerning theſe Ages, wherein we do not ſay the change was made, and which we ſuppoſe to have been different from thoſe which followed. Yet ſeeing Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> will needs have 'em brought into the Diſpute, I am willing to treat of them.</p>
                        <p>I THEN reckon'd in the Church five ſorts of perſons, who had no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct <note place="margin">Anſwer to the ſecond Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, part 2. chap. 3.</note> knowledg of the Real Preſence, neither to reject nor admit it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out comprehending therein the prophane or worldly minded perſons, and grounded my diviſion on this reaſon. That 'tis not poſſible in this great diverſity of conditions and humors of men, to reduce them all either to one and the ſame meaſure of knowledg, or to the ſame form of action.</p>
                        <p>THE firſt rank is of thoſe who conceiv'd theſe two terms the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, the Sacrament under the notion which their ſenſes gave them; for whether 'twas call'd Bread, or by any other name, the idea they form'd thereof was ſuch as their eyes repreſented them with. They conceiv'd the Body of Jeſus Chriſt after the manner which the Goſpel ſpeaks of it, as a body, and fleſh like unto that which we have, born of a Virgin, united to the Eternal Word, hanging on the Croſs, riſen and taken up into Glory, and in a word under the idea which Religion gives us of it. The idea of the Sacrament ſerved to make them paſs on to that of the Body, but they ſtopt there, and made not a particular reflection thereon, how the Sacrament was the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. Their devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being content with the uſe which they made of the Sacrament, unto which they were aſſiſted by this formulary of Communion, <hi>Corpus Chriſti,</hi> they proceeded not ſo far as that queſtion.</p>
                        <p>THE ſecond rank is of thoſe who proceeded to the queſtion, How this viſible Bread, this ſubject call'd Sacrament, is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt? but finding a great deal of inconſiſtency in the terms, their minds ſtopt at the ſingle difficulty without undertaking to ſolve it.</p>
                        <p>THE third is of thoſe who going as far as the queſtion, proceeded as far as the ſolution, but their minds ſtopt at general terms, as that Jeſus Chriſt is preſent to us in the Sacrament, and that we receive his Body and Blood therein without ſearching after greater ſatisfaction.</p>
                        <p>THE fourth is of thoſe who having been diſguſted at the inconſiſtency of theſe terms, the Bread and the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, found at length the real knot of the queſtion, I mean, that the Bread is the Sacrament, the memorial, and pledg of the Sacred Body of our Redeemer.</p>
                        <p>THE fifth in fine is of thoſe who at the hearing of theſe propoſitions, <hi>The Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, The Bread is chang'd into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, the Bread is made the Body of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> went immediately to their true and natural ſenſe, without perplexity or difficulty, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much as thinking on the inconſiſtency of the terms, well underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Bread remaining Bread is conſecrated to be a Sacrament, which repreſents and communicates to us the Lords Body; and theſe had a
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41961:265"/> more clear and diſtinct knowledg of the truth, and a greater diſpoſition to underſtand the ſtile and uſual expreſſions of the Church.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>HERE'S,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud, what Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>calls the happy days of the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 6. ch. 5. pag. 560.</note> 
                           <hi>Church, and the time of the diſtinct knowledg. And yet of theſe five ranks there are three who knew not what the Euchariſt was, and underſtood not the ſenſe of the expreſſions which form this Doctrin. The fourth ſought and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily found it,</hi> ſays he, <hi>after a long ſearch, and the fifth found it without ſearching it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I ACKNOWLEDG that what has been ſaid of theſe five ranks, may be underſtood of all the time which preceded the change, but yet we may divide this time into two, and diſtinguiſh that wherein the Paſtors took a more particular care to inſtruct the people, and that of ignorance wherein the myſteries of the Goſpel were neglected, and the people ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. For as ignorance was never ſo great, nor univerſal, but that there were ever ſome perſons knowing enough to underſtand diſtinctly, that the Bread is call'd the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe 'tis the Sacrament of it, ſo knowledg never ſo generally overſpread the Church, but there were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſome weak and ignorant perſons in it. When we diſtinguiſh a time of knowledg, from a time of ignorance, we do not mean there were no ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant people, during the time of knowledg, nor enlightned perſons during the time of ignorance. We do not thus underſtand it. But we take the denomination from the party that moſt prevail'd, and call a time of light, and knowledg, that wherein we ſee appear more learning and clearneſs; a time of darkneſs, and ignorance that wherein we find on the contrary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear much more thickneſs and ſtupidity. When then I ſaid that I reckon'd theſe five ranks of perſons in the Church, I underſtood that this was true in both the two times, that is to ſay, both in that which I called the Churches happy days, the time of a diſtinct knowledg, and in that of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and confuſion; but I likewiſe meant that this was true in theſe two times diverſly according to the difference which diſtinguiſhes them, ſo that when the ſenſe of my propoſition is diſtributed, reaſon requires that the proportion of each time be kept. We muſt not doubt but that in the firſt ſix Centuries there were perſons to be found of theſe three firſt ranks which I denoted, but far fewer than in the following Ages.</p>
                        <p>AFTER this firſt remark Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> makes another, which is, that I do not prove what I offer touching theſe five orders, <hi>This is,</hi> ſays he, <hi>an</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 6. ch. 6. pag. 563.</note> 
                           <hi>Hiſtory no where extant. Theſe are news which he alone knows, and for which he can bring no more proof than for worlds in the Moon.</hi> But this is Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi>'s uſual courſe, when he cannot anſwer an Argument he requires proofs for it, and ſo when he cannot invalidate an Anſwer he bethinks himſelf of ſaying, <hi>prove it.</hi> The Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> affirms that the change which we pretend is impoſſible, I affirm 'tis poſſible, and to ſhew that it is ſo, I ſuppoſe by way of explication and illuſtration five ranks of perſons in the Church during the time which preceded the change. If I ſuppoſe a thing impoſſible or abſurd, it lies upon Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to ſhew the impoſſibility or abſurdity thereof, and not to require proofs of me. I ſuppoſe nothing but what lies within the terms of probability, and is conformable to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of mens thoughts, which appears by their every days actions in like occaſions as this, altho not recorded in Hiſtory. Howſoever if Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> will have the Authors Argument of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> to remain in force,

                        <p>AND this he ſeems to be ſenſible of, for he does not much inſiſt on this demand of proofs, but comes to a particular examination of theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ranks, and to make it the more pleaſant, he gives each of 'em a nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name and title; the firſt he calls the rank of Contemplative Ignoramus's, the next that of Lazy Ignoramus's, the third that of Catholicks, the fourth of Conſiderate Calviniſts, the fifth that of Inconſiderate ones. In diſcourſing on the firſt rank he gives us a touch about <hi>Mental Prayer,</hi> of being <hi>ſnatcht up immediately into Heaven,</hi> concerning <hi>our meditation on the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in abſtracto, and ſtanding upon our guard againſt the terms which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the eſſence of the Myſtery;</hi> and he uſes the ſame pleaſant method about the reſt, which ſhews he can be frolickſome ſometimes, and has his hours of creation, as well as other folks.</p>
                        <p>BUT laying aſide theſe fine words, let us come to things. The Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> intending to prove that the Faithful ever had a diſtinct knowledg of the Preſence or Real Abſence, offer'd the formulary of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion <note place="margin">Refutat. part 2. chap. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>Corpus Chriſti,</hi> which was uſed in the ancient Church, ſaying that theſe terms repreſented the Body of Jeſus Chriſt preſent on the Altar; and thence he concluded they had a diſtinct belief that it was thereon, if they follow'd the ſenſe of theſe words, or if they rejected them, they had a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct belief of the Real Abſence.</p>
                        <p>TO this I anſwer'd, that the firſt impreſſion which things make on our minds, and words deſign'd to any uſe, is that of their uſe, that 'tis thus every morning that we conceive of the light, not as being under the notion <note place="margin">Anſwer to the ſecond Treat. part 2. ch. 2.</note> of a body or accident, or motion of air, but under the notion of a thing which is uſeful to us, and ſerves to lead us to our labors, which I farther il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated by ſeveral other examples. Then applying this remark to my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I ſaid that this formulary <hi>Corpus Chriſti,</hi> was a formulary of uſe, deſign'd according to the intention of the Church to raiſe up the minds of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants to the meditating on the Body of Jeſus Chriſt dead and riſen for them. Whence I concluded there were ſeveral perſons who contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with doing that to which theſe words excited them, without proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any farther, their minds being ſufficiently taken up with that. And this is that which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> calls <hi>extravagant</hi> and <hi>fantaſtical,</hi> and wherein he meets with ſuch <hi>ridiculous Hypotheſiſes, ſenſleſs ſuppoſitions, and abſurdities. 'Tis impoſſible,</hi> ſays he, <hi>for a diſcourſe to be more faulty than this, altho it be the foundation of the firſt order of this ſyſtem. Firſt, 'twill not ſerve the end whereunto 'tis deſign'd. Secondly, 'tis laid on a falſe foundation. Thirdly, it concludes nothing this falſe foundation being ſuppoſed.</hi> Theſe three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks are eſſential, and need only proving.</p>
                        <p>AS to the firſt, he ſays, <hi>That ſuppoſing this ridiculous Hypotheſis were granted me, yet there muſt be made ſeveral others to draw thence the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I draw. Firſt, It muſt be ſuppoſed that the Paſtors who inſtructed the Communicants when they firſt received the Euchariſt, taught 'em only to make a Mental Prayer over the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, without mentioning to 'em a word of the eſſence of the myſtery, and ſenſe of the words which expreſs it, and ſatisfying the doubts which might ſpring up in their minds about it. And yet the form of theſe inſtructions appearing in the Writings of S.</hi> Cyril <hi>of</hi>
                           <pb n="138" facs="tcp:41961:266"/> Jeruſalem, S. Ambroſe, Gaudencius, <hi>and</hi> Eucherus, <hi>are very apt to imprint on their minds the diſtinct idea of the Faith of the Myſtery, according to the Doctrin of the Catholicks. Secondly, We muſt ſuppoſe that when theſe people met with this expreſſion either in Sermons, or particular Diſcourſes, or Books, that the Euchariſt is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, they caution'd themſelves againſt admitting into their minds any idea of theſe words, but were immediately ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh'd with abſtracted Meditations. Thirdly, 'Tis to be ſuppoſed that this laſted'em all their lives. Fourthly, We muſt ſuppoſe they uſed the ſame cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt theſe expreſſions, The Bread is changed into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is made of Bread, we are nouriſh'd with the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt enters into us, that it is our ſtrength and our life.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I ANSWER, that ſuppoſing the Propoſition I ſtated touching the things, and uſual expreſſions, were fruitleſs in reſpect of the inſtructions given to the Catechumeniſts, and thoſe other expreſſions mention'd by Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> yet does it not hence follow but 'twould be uſeful in reſpect of theſe terms <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> which were ſpoken before to the Communicants at the time wherein the Euchariſt is deliver'd to 'em. Now 'tis preciſely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account I made uſe of it, that is to ſay, to anſwer the Argument which the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> rais'd from theſe words <hi>Corpus Chriſti,</hi> which he ſaid repreſented the Body of Jeſus Chriſt preſent on the Altar. I ſhew'd then that theſe words were not only words of inſtruction, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of uſe; the drift of which were to repreſent to the Communicants the Body of Chriſt dead and riſen for us. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ought to conſider my propoſition in reference to the particular end for which I uſed it, and not take it looſe (as he has done) from the ſequel of my diſcourſe. But 'tis his cuſtom when he propoſes any thing which I mention, to repreſent it indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and 'tis on ſuch kind of proceedings as theſe whereon are grounded the greateſt part of his objections.</p>
                        <p>TO confirm the truth of my Propoſition, 'tis not neceſſary to change any thing in the Catechiſms of the Fathers; there needs only one thing be ſuppoſed, which is not hard to believe, which is, that neither the Catechiſms of S. <hi>Cyril,</hi> nor thoſe attributed to S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and S. <hi>Eucherus,</hi> were uſed as forms of inſtructions which were given to perſons the firſt time they Communicated, ſeeing the greateſt part amongſt 'em received their firſt Communion, immediately after they were Baptized in their tender years, yea ſometimes whilſt at their Mothers Breaſts. I confeſs indeed they were not then taught to make Mental Prayers, as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſpeaks; and 'tis alſo likely they had neither the Catechiſms of S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> nor S. <hi>Cyril</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to 'em, as he pleaſantly ſuppoſes. And thus Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s firſt Obſervation is abſurd.</p>
                        <p>AS to the Books they read, 'tis not neceſſary to ſay, they caution'd themſelves againſt the words which they met in 'em, we need only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one thing which is not unlikely. That there were at that time, and are at this day in the Church ſeveral people who could not read, and that amongſt ſuch as could, there were ſome that read little in the Treatiſes of the Fathers concerning the Euchariſt, Books not being then ſo common as they have been ſince Printing has been invented, and in fine, that amongſt thoſe who did, there might be ſome who applied not themſelves attentively enough to form in their minds the queſtion how the Sacrament is our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Body.</p>
                        <pb n="139" facs="tcp:41961:266"/>
                        <p>AS to private Diſcourſes, if Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> by revelation knows any thing of 'em we'l hear him willingly, in the mean time he'l let us ſuppoſe, that there have been always people in the Church, who never ſet themſelves to treat of abſtruſe queſtions of Theology in familiar Colloquies.</p>
                        <p>AND as to Sermons, ſeeing Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> pretends they muſt inſpire all perſons with curioſity that hear them, 'twould be juſt he ſhould tell us, firſt whether he believes the Preachers handled always the Euchariſt in difficult terms, ſufficient to excite the curioſity of their hearers touching the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on how the Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. Whether they explain'd not themſelves in terms clear and eaſie, which gave no occaſion for this queſtion. Secondly, 'Twould be juſt for him to tell us, whether when they made theſe difficult diſcourſes they cauſed all the Faithful in general to come to 'em, and charged 'em not to fail of forming in their minds the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, How the Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. Thirdly, In ſhort it might be expected he ſhould tell us whether he believes that all the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were of equal capacities to make reflections on the difficult expreſſions of the Fathers. For if he does not ſuppoſe theſe three things, there's little likelihood theſe expreſſions he mentions muſt have produc'd the effect in mens minds which he pretends. Perhaps perſons of mean capacities, who yet may be good men (altho they have but little knowledg) in hearing their Preachers would have turn'd their minds ſooner on the ſide of eaſie terms, than that of difficult ones. Perhaps alſo ſome of 'em did let theſe difficult ways of ſpeaking paſs without conſidering 'em with much attention, and troubling themſelves with queſtions beyond their reach: and thus may I ſuppoſe the expreſſions of the Fathers ſeldom made any deep impreſſion on them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mr. CLA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>DE,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud, who thinks that the putting of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy into mood and figure, is ſufficient to make it concluſive and deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, propoſes us this in an inſulting manner. What likelihood,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is there people ſhould proceed to reflections on this myſtery t' inform themſelves whether it be really Jeſus Chriſt or not?</hi> I anſwer, the queſtion here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the eight firſt Ages, and what he alledges I ſaid, was meant of the time of the moſt groſs ignorance, as 'twill appear to him that ſhall take the pains to ſee my words in the proper place whence he has taken them. He has not done fairly in this matter. For altho it be acknowledged that in the time wherein the Paſtors took care to inſtruct their Flock, there might be ſome perſons who proceeded not to the queſtion, how the Sacrament was the Body of Jeſus Chriſt? yet would we not be underſtood to ſpeak gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of the people of that time, as if there were no difference between them and thoſe that lived in the time when ignorance moſt prevail'd.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> further, <hi>There's nothing more wonderful than the alliance which Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>makes in this imaginary order, of two qualities the moſt irreconcilable in the world. Every body knows that an high Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on does ordinarily ſuppoſe a higher knowledg of Myſteries than is to be expected in the common ſort of the Faithful. Yet it ſeems the perſons of which this rank conſiſts were on one hand ſo ſtupid that they comprehended nothing in the moſt ordinary expreſſions amongſt the Chriſtians, altho their ears were ſtruck with 'em in a thouſand manners; and yet ſo ſpiritual on the other, that at the ſight of the Sacrament, or upon the leaſt mention of it, they had immediately</hi>
                           <pb n="140" facs="tcp:41961:267"/> 
                           <hi>their whole hearts ſo fixt on the Body of their Saviour, that they could not reflect on the words uſed in the celebration of the myſtery, or popular inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>EVERY body knows that to raiſe up one's devotion to our Saviour Chriſt who died and roſe again for us, 'tis not neceſſary to have a very high knowledg of Myſteries. As the Death of Jeſus Chriſt, and his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are the moſt neceſſary notions of Chriſtianity, ſo are they likewiſe the firſt; and if a man be not ſpiritual enough to ſend up his Devotions to our Saviour, 'tis certain he is no Chriſtian. Neither need a man be very know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to comprehend that the Sacrament is deſign'd for this uſe. The whole action of the Euchariſt leads the moſt ſimple to this, and the <hi>ſurſum corda</hi> which they underſtood put them in mind of it. But to make reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the expreſſions of the Fatherr, when they call the Euchariſt the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, or ſaid the Bread was the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, this requires greater ability and curioſity. As to the firſt, which is the lifting up our hearts to our Saviour Chriſt dead and riſen, it needs only be ſuppoſed that the perſons of this firſt rank now before us, had learned their <hi>Creed,</hi> that they were not ignorant our Saviour died and roſe again for us, and knew the Euchariſt was intended to make us remember him. Now there are few Chriſtians but know this. But as to the ſecond, which is to make reflections on the expreſſions of the Fathers, 'tis to be ſuppoſed they had retain'd the common expreſſions which their Paſtors uſed in their Sermons or Books, and becauſe they were many, and very different from one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, ſome having no difficulty, and others on the contrary being hard to be underſtood, we may imagin they preciſely applied themſelves to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult ones, without contenting 'emſelves with the others: 'tis likewiſe to be ſuppoſed they had compared together theſe two ideas, that of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and remarkt the differences by a formal act of Meditation. Now all this requires ſome application of mind, without which 'tis very poſſible that ſimple people may remain in the Chriſtian profeſſion. Thus we ſee what's become of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s firſt Remark, and whether my ſuppoſition touching the perſons of the firſt rank, ought to be reſpected as an extravagant and ſenſleſs diſtinction.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D</hi>'s ſecond Remark contains, <hi>That 'tis falſe the uſe of this expreſſion</hi> Corpus Chriſti, <hi>which was ſpoken to thoſe who Communicated, was according to the intention of the Church, to make them meditate on the Body of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in abſtracto; <hi>that 'tis certain on the contrary, that this formulary</hi> Corpus Chriſti <hi>was deſign'd to inſtruct them in the truth of the myſtery, and exact from 'em the confeſſion of it, ſo that 'twas a formulary of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and a profeſſion of Faith, and not of Practice and Action.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THIS diſcourſe has all the characters of a perſon that finds himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled. What means he by meditating on the Body of Jeſus Chriſt <hi>in abſtracto?</hi> Is it meditating on his Death, Reſurrection, and ſitting on the right hand of the Father? 'Tis certain that this was the intention of theſe words according to the deſign of the Goſpel, as appears by the teſtimonies which I alledged from the Author of the Commentaries attributed to S. <hi>Hierom, Primaſus</hi> an African Biſhop, and S. <hi>Baſil;</hi> and this may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by ſeveral other paſſages, and by theſe words of S. <hi>Auguſtin, We call</hi>

                           <hi>Bread and Wine that which being taken from the Fruits of the Earth, and conſecrated by the myſtical Prayer, is received by us for the Salvation of</hi>

                           <hi>of our ſouls in remembrance of the Death which our Lord has ſuffered for our ſakes:</hi> And by theſe of <hi>Tatianus, Jeſus Chriſt having taken the Bread and</hi>

                           <hi>Wine, teſtified they were his Body and Blood, and commanded his Diſciples to eat and drink thereof, in remembrance of his approaching Sufferings and Death.</hi> But for this purpoſe 'twere better to read the words of S. <hi>Paul.

                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.</note> 
                           <hi>the Lords Death till he comes.</hi> If by meditating on the Body of Jeſus Chriſt <hi>in abſtracto,</hi> he means the meditating on it without conceiving it preſent on the Altar, 'tis not ſufficient to ſay 'tis falſe, that this was the deſign of this formulary, <hi>Corpus Chriſti,</hi> according to the intention of the Church, he muſt prove that the Church meant by theſe words to repreſent this Body preſent in its proper ſubſtance in the Euchariſt, which is what he muſt prove if he deſigns to uphold the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi>'s Argument, and does not think it ſufficient, to ſay, <hi>This is moſt falſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>THIS formulary,</hi> ſays he, <hi>was deſign'd to inſtruct them in the truth of the myſtery:</hi> Who doubts it? It was a formulary of uſe, and inſtruction both together, as I plainly intimated in my anſwer to the Author of the <hi>Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity;</hi> It behoves us only to know what is this truth of the myſtery in which it inſtructs men. <hi>'Twas,</hi> ſays he, <hi>moreover a formulary and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith, and not of Practice and Action.</hi> And I ſay 'twas both the one and the other. I have proved 'twas a formulary of Practice, I acknowledg 'twas a formulary of profeſſion of Faith. But that this Faith of which it required the profeſſion was the ſubſtantial Preſence of Jeſus Chriſt in the Sacrament, is what I deny and what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ought to prove. <hi>I prove it,</hi> ſays he, <hi>by the word Amen which the Communicants anſwered.</hi> The <hi>Amen</hi> which the Communicants pronounced, ſignifies nothing leſs than this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ſubſtance. The Book of the Initiated attributed to S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> draws thence only this concluſion <hi>vere carnis illius Sacramentum eſt; It is</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ambroſ. de iis qui myſt. init. cap. 9. lib. 4. de Sacr. cap. 3. Aug. Serm. ad infr. Serm. de quarta feria.</note> 
                           <hi>truly the Sacrament of the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Author of the Book of Sacraments, wrongly cited by Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> under the name of S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> refers it to the Spiritual Communion of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, which we have in the Sacrament. S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> refers it to our ſelves, being made the Body of Jeſus Chriſt and his Members. The Author of the Treatiſe of <hi>Dreſſing the Lords Field,</hi> refers it to the Faith of the Death of Jeſus Chriſt, and effuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Blood. Pope <hi>Leo</hi> refers it to the reality of the humane Nature of Jeſus Chriſt, againſt the Error of the Eutichiens. And it ſignifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to offer ſo earneſtly what this Pope ſays, <hi>Hoc ore ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitur quod fide creditur, &amp; fruſtra ab illis Amen reſpondetur à quibus contra id quod accipitur diſputatur,</hi> for 'tis clear enough that theſe terms ſignifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but that the Sacrament which we receive with our mouths, is a declaration and confirmation of what we ought to believe, to wit, that Jeſus Chriſt has aſſumed a real humane Nature, becauſe 'tis the Sacrament of his real Body which we receive, and that the <hi>Amen</hi> which is anſwered is the Seal of this truth, ſo that when the Hereticks diſpute againſt it, they diſpute againſt the very <hi>Amen</hi> which they pronounce. And this is the ſenſe of <hi>Leo,</hi> in all which there's no ſubſtantial Preſence.</p>
                        <p>AS to what remains, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> takes a ſtrange liberty. I told the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> that this formulary <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> was a formu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary of <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>action</hi> deſigned for the ſtirring up of the Communicants to meditate on the Death of Jeſus Chriſt, and prov'd it very clearly by theſe words of the Author of the Commentaries attributed to S. <hi>Hierom. Our</hi>
                           <pb n="142" facs="tcp:41961:268"/> 
                           <hi>Saviour has given us his Sacramen to the end that by this means we ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remember</hi> THAT HE DIED FOR US, AND THEREFORE WHEN WE RECEIVE IT FROM THE HAND OF THE PRIEST, WE ARE TOLD THAT 'TIS THE BODY AND BLOOD OF JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST; and by thoſe of <hi>Primaſus, Every time we do this we ought to remember,</hi> THAT JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR US; AND THERE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORE WE ARE TOLD 'TIS THE BODY OF CHRIST, <hi>to the end that remembring what he has done for us we may not be ungrateful.</hi> What does Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> hereupon? He conceals theſe paſſages, and concludes from his own authority, <hi>That theſe notions of uſe, and this extaſie of the Soul immediately tranſported by theſe words</hi> Corpus Chriſti <hi>to the meditation of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in abſtracto, <hi>are Mr.</hi> Claudes <hi>Dreams, exactly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the ſentiments of the Fathers, and the Churches intention, and that there's ſmall likelihood the faithful would depart from them to dive immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately into theſe kind of Meditations.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>'TIS certain Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> can conquer when he pleaſes, he ſuppreſſes my Arguments, recites my words in a contrary ſenſe, turns things into ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule, and flouriſhes all this over with paſſionate expreſſions. But proceed we to his third remark.</p>
                        <p>IT affirms I conclude nothing tho the falſe Principle on which I ground <note place="margin">Page 573.</note> my Arguments were ſuppoſed a true one. <hi>Altho,</hi> ſays he, <hi>'twere true that theſe words</hi> Corpus Chriſti <hi>were not deſigned by the Church to inſtruct the Faithful, but only to excite in them certain inward motions, and ſet them on meditating upon the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; yet this intention of the Church hindred 'em from underſtanding the ſenſe of theſe words: and 'twould be ſtill ridiculous to ſuppoſe, that theſe ignorant perſons ſhould ſo immediately enter upon the practice of theſe inward motions, that they could not underſtand the terms which the Church made uſe of to excite them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I ANSWER, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> charges me with two things unjuſtly, the firſt, That I affirm this Formulary was not deſign'd by the Church to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Faithful, but only to excite internal motions in them, which I never imagin'd: I affirm'd expreſly rhe contrary, as may be ſeen by whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall conſult that part of my anſwer noted in the Margin. There's <note place="margin">Anſwer to the ſecond Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> part 2. ch. 2. page 259. In <hi>Quarto</hi> Edit.</note> little ſincerity in this imputation; and as little in charging me with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion which I do not draw, and in ſuppreſſing that which I do. I do not conclude the intention of the Church which deſign'd theſe terms, <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> to excite inward motions in the Souls of the Communicants, ſhould hinder them from underſtanding the ſenſe of theſe words. I know that as the uſe which is made of things does not hinder but we may conſider the nature of 'em if we will, ſo that which is made of words does not hinder a man from examining their ſenſe. But, I ſay, there are ſeveral perſons who ſtop at the bare notion of uſe without going farther, and thence I concluded it may be well ſuppoſed that in the ancient Church there were ſeveral perſons who hearing the words <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> when they Communicated, applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only to the practice of the inward affections of devotion, which theſe terms excited, without going any farther, and making reflection on what the terms, being applied to the Sacrament ſignifi'd. Let any man now judg, whether my ſuppoſition be ridiculous, extravagant and ſenſleſs, as Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> would make people believe; or whether 'tis not rather by a ſpirit of contradiction that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has taken upon him to refute it.</p>

                        <p>THE ſecond rank is <hi>of thoſe that proceeded ſo far as the queſtion, how this viſible Bread, this ſubject called Sacrament, is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; but finding an inconſiſtency in the terms, their minds ſettled on the only difficulty without undertaking to ſolve it.</hi>

                        <p>Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D</hi> ſays, <hi>That the Fathers have not known theſe kind of</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 6. ch. 7. pag. 575.</note> 
                           <hi>people;</hi> he means they have not mention'd them in their Writings. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Fathers never knew 'em, does Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> believe the Fathers muſt needs know or expound all the ſeveral manners of taking things, which were practis'd by all particular perſons? Had they nothing elſe to do but to make general inventories of mens fancies, to find out and denote diſtinctly the ſtrength or weakneſs of each individual perſon. If he imagins 'tis a ſufficient reaſon to affirm there were not any perſons in the ancient Church, who finding great difficulty in this propoſition, that the Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, ſtuck here without undertaking to clear the point, to ſay the Fathers have known none of this kind, he muſt acknowledg at the ſame time that there were none likewiſe that took theſe words in this ſenſe, That the ſubſtance of Bread is chang'd into the ſubſtance of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. For I maintain that the Fathers have not known any of theſe kind of people, never ſpake of 'em, never offer'd 'em as an example to doubters, nor declared that this was the true ſenſe of their expreſſions. Neither can it be anſwer'd, that if they have not mention'd 'em, 'twas becauſe all the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41961:269"/> Faithful took them in this ſenſe. For Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> confeſſes himſelf, <hi>'Tis proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>

                           <hi>that the belief of the Faithful has been ever clear and diſtinct on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Real Preſence, and that they have ever known whether what was given them was or was not the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, altho they knew not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſo expreſly and univerſally whether the Bread did or did not remain in the Sacrament.</hi> Any man may ſee what means ſuch an acknowledgment from Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> I repeat it here again, that 'tis poſſible the Faithful did not always ſo expreſly and univerſally know whether the Bread remains or not in the Sacrament, which is without doubt at this time a very conſiderable acknowledgment. But not to extend it further than the terms will bear, we may at leaſt conclude thence that the Fathers ought to ſuppoſe there were perſons who probably would not take theſe words, <hi>The Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in this ſenſe, <hi>The ſubſtance of the Bread is changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſubſtance of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> and hereupon may be askt why they have not obſerv'd the exactneſs and quickneſs of underſtanding in the one, to deliver the reſt from the ignorance wherein Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges they may have been.</p>

Neither did this hinder 'em from receiving with great reſpect the Bread and Wine, as pledges and remembrances of our Lords Body and Blood. For 'tis not impoſſible for perſons to know the Euchariſt to be a remembrance of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and that alſo the Bread and Wine are ſaid to be the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, without knowing that the firſt of theſe expreſſions is the cauſe of the ſecond, which is to ſay, that the Bread and Wine are ſaid to be this Body and Blood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the memorials and pledges of it.</p>

                           <hi>underſtand the Bread to be the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in a ſenſe of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, or in a ſenſe of Conſubſtantiation, rather than to take them in this ſenſe, that the Bread remaining Bread was the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; ſeeing the ſenſe of Tranſubſtantiation has been follow'd by all Chriſtians ſince ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years; and that of Conſubſtantiation has been embraced by the Luther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: whereas the laſt ſenſe has been follow'd by no body, and as yet never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into any mans thoughts.</hi> I anſwer in two words, 'twas becauſe neither Tranſubſtantiation, nor Conſubſtantiation were then found out, and that theſe perſons we ſpeak of had not Philoſophy enough to invent 'em them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They follow'd nature, which will not ſuffer us to take otherwiſe this propoſition, if we underſtand it literally, than by conceiving the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary idea of real Bread, and the common notion of a real Body; that is to ſay two inconſiſtent ideas. Moreover, not to inſiſt upon what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſays, that the ſenſe of Tranſubſtantiation has been follow'd by all Chriſtians for this ſix hundred years; after what has been ſeen hitherto we may judg what truth there is in this propoſition. Neither do I at preſent mind what he ſays, that the laſt ſenſe has been follow'd by no body: this is as little ture as the reſt. <hi>Rupert</hi> held the aſſumption of the Bread, <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> has openly aſſerted it; not to mention here that the true opinion of the Greek Church ſince <hi>Damaſcen</hi> is, that the Bread remaining Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt by the union of the Divinity, and by way of augmentation of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. But when there's occaſion to deny or affirm things, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is always at his liberty.</p>
                        <p>I SAID that theſe perſons of the ſecond rank of whom we now ſpeak, finding great inconſiſtency in theſe terms, <hi>Bread and Body of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> found no ſenſe in this propoſition, <hi>The Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and that it appear'd to them unintelligible. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſays hereupon, <hi>That when two inconſiſtent notions are affirmed one of another, we learn three things. 1, Theſe two notions affirm'd, that is to ſay, the notion of each one of the terms. 2. The affirmation which is made of 'em. 3. The falſity and impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility</hi>
                           <pb n="146" facs="tcp:41961:270"/> 
                           <hi>of this affirmation, and that if this propoſition is of a perſon to whom we cannot attribute a falſity, we have a fourth knowledg, which is, that this impoſſible affirmation is not the ſenſe which the Author of the propoſition had in his mind.</hi> I grant this. But I grant not the conſequence he would draw hence, <hi>that one knows an inconſiſtent ſenſe;</hi> for that which he calls an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent ſenſe is not a ſenſe. We know an inconſiſtency, a mutual repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy of terms which cannot be reconcil'd; but we do not conceive a ſenſe. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſays, <hi>That this Philoſophy ſurpaſſes his underſtanding, and ſeems to him to contain a manifeſt falſity.</hi> We muſt then endeavour to explain it to him, and make him acknowledg the truth of it. And for this effect it muſt be ſuppoſed that we ſpeak here of an affirmative propoſition, <hi>The Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that we ſpeak of perſons who reſpected the three terms of which this propoſition conſiſts, according to their literal ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, conceiving the common idea of <hi>Bread,</hi> the common idea of a human Body, and taking the term <hi>eſt</hi> in a ſenſe of being real. This being ſuppoſed, I ſay, that in reſpect of an affirmative propoſition, a ſenſe is a notion which unites two ideas, and in which a mans mind may acquieſce, either in deceiving or not deceiving it ſelf; if it be not deceiv'd, 'tis a real ſenſe, if it be 'tis a falſe ſenſe. The knowledg of an inconſiſtency is on the contrary a notion that ſo ſeparates two ideas, that it makes them op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and overthrow one another, and declares them irreconcilable. Now 'tis not to be imagin'd that a man can reconcile in his mind two ideas which his underſtanding judges to be abſolutely repugnant. To conceive a ſenſe, is to conceive a thing poſſible, to conceive an inconſiſtency is to conceive that there is therein an impoſſibility; to conceive a ſenſe is to conceive a ſtate wherein the mind or underſtanding may ſubſiſt; whereas to conceive an inconſiſtency, is to conceive that there is not there a ſtate wherein the mind can ſubſiſt. It is then certain, as I ſaid, that an inconſiſtency is not a ſenſe, and that 'tis to ſpeak abuſively to ſay an inconſiſtent ſenſe; for this is as much as to ſay a ſenſe which is not a ſenſe, a ſenſe is a notion which unites two ideas, and an inconſiſtency diſunites them. <hi>All Mr.</hi> Claudes <hi>ſubtilty,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Page 580.</note> 
                           <hi>or rather deceit,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud, lies in that he does not diſtinguiſh between a conceiv'd and an expreſſed ſenſe, and a ſenſe believ'd and approv'd of. 'Tis certain that thoſe who find a propoſition includes an inconſiſtency according to the letter, and ſee no other ſenſe therein, do approve no other; but 'tis not true that they conceive no other ſenſe therein, for they conceive an inconſiſtent ſenſe, which is to ſay, that they conceive only inconſiſtent terms are therein affirmed, and therefore diſapprove of 'em, and conclude from the inconſiſtency of this ſenſe, that this is not the ſenſe of the propoſition of the Scripture and the Church.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Philoſophy has given here a falſe ſtroke; for, fot to ſay that a man conceives an inconſiſtent ſenſe, is to ſpeak abſurdly. We muſt diſtinguiſh between thoſe that offer an inconſiſtent propoſition, and theſe that judg it inconſiſtent. Thoſe that offer it, do not always ſee the inconſiſtency of the terms, either becauſe they conceive them under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects wherein th' inconſiſtency does not diſcover it ſelf, or becauſe they conceive them confuſedly, and in ſuch a manner wherein they hide from themſelves the contradiction, and then thoſe that judg of their propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on enter into their thoughts, and conceive the ſenſe which the others have imagin'd to be poſſible, altho in effect it be not. They ſuſpend a while their own judgments, to put themſelves in the place of others, and by this means conceive this apparent poſſibility which has deceiv'd them. But this is not
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:41961:270"/> to conceive an inconſiſtent ſenſe, but on the contrary a ſenſe that appears conſiſtent and reaſonable to abuſed perſons, altho at bottom it be otherwiſe. Whilſt a man judges of it according to the falſe lights of theſe perſons, he calls it a ſenſe, becauſe his mind acquieſces therein, as ſeeing nothing therein impoſſible, but as ſoon as he judges of it upon th' account of th' inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency of the terms, 'tis no longer a ſence, 'tis a mere contradiction that has no ſenſe, and which is unintelligible. I confeſs, that as mens minds are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to fearful capricio's, it ſometimes happens that they advance propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherein contradictions are ſo evident that they muſt needs have ſeen 'em themſelves: ſuch as is that of this Philſoſopher mention'd by Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> who affirmed, <hi>That if God pleas'd, two and two ſhould not be four:</hi> but in this caſe 'tis requiſite to ſay that theſe perſons impoſe on the world, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not themſelves what they ſay. For, for to ſay that a man can make to himſelf a ſenſe of a contradiction, when it appears to him to be a contradiction, that he can unite two ideas, by affirming one of the other at the ſame time, wherein he ſees they cannot be accorded; that is to ſay, that he can perſuade himſelf that a thing is poſſible, ev'n then when it ſeems to him to be impoſſible. If this be Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Philoſophy, he muſt Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſe by himſelf for me.</p>
                        <p>'TIS then clear, I had reaſon to ſay, that this ſecond rank of perſons, which I ſuppoſed in the ancient Church, who found inconſiſtency in the terms of this propoſition, <hi>The Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> conceiv'd properly no ſenſe at all in it. For as to their parts they could not find any in it, ſeeing the propoſition to them ſeem'd inconſiſtent. Neither could their Paſtors help 'em, ſeeing 'tis laid down for a maxim, that they knew not in what ſenſe the Fathers underſtood it. <hi>But,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud, not knowing</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Page 580.</note> 
                           <hi>any other way to make the Euchariſt to be the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, they muſt make an entire ſeparation of the Bread and Body, and abſolutely deny the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and exiſtence of Jeſus Chriſt in the Bread, which is rejecting the Real Preſence.</hi> I anſwer that this is not a good concluſion, the perſons of which we ſpeak found no ſenſe in the propoſition, The Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, the two ideas of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> appeared to them inconſiſtent, they knew no other means of making the Bread to be the Body, I grant, but ſeeing 'twas a propoſition of their Paſtors, whom they would not charge with falſity; and being taught it as from the authority of Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, 'tis not to be doubted but they acknowledg'd in general that it muſt have a good ſenſe, altho they knew not which was this good ſenſe; and therefore I ſaid in my anſwer to the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> that <hi>their minds ſtopt at the only diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, without undertaking to reſolve it.</hi> 'Tis fruitleſs to enquire whether they rejected by a poſitive judgment the unity of theſe two ſubſtances <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> or whether their minds hung in ſuſpenſe, notwithſtanding what appear'd to 'em from th' inconſiſtency of the terms. I have not attributed to them this rejection, as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſays I have, in impertinently tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring what I ſaid of them, who went as far as the Sacramental ſenſe, to thoſe of this ſecond rank, who proceeded not ſo far. But whether they formally rejected this unity of two ſubſtances, or only ſuſpended their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it is clear they neither rejected Tranſubſtantiation, nor Conſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation; for neither one nor the other of theſe two opinions eſtabliſhes th' unity of theſe two ſubſtances Bread and Body, in the ſenſe we underſtand it here, that is to ſay, by affirming that the Bread remaining Bread is the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Jeſus Chriſt. They may have deny'd the Real Preſence in this laſt ſenſe, that is to ſay, judged that the Bread remaining Bread, cannot be the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:41961:271"/> Body of Jeſus Chriſt; but as to other ways ſince found out to make the Bread to be the Body, having no knowledg of 'em, they could not reject them. They rejected (if you will) the unity of the two ſubſtances, they conceived no ſenſe in this expreſſion, the Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; yet they acknowledg'd it muſt have a good and a true one, altho they knew not in particular which that was, they carry'd off their minds from this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, but in all this they conceiv'd no diſtinct notice either of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation or Conſubſtantiation.</p>
                        <p>IN vain does Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> endeavour to perſuade us, <hi>That the natural</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Page 583.</note> 
                           <hi>idea of theſe words, The Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, in explaining them in the uſual manner was, that appearing Bread 'twas not ſo, but the very Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and that 'tis a renouncing all the lights of reaſon to pretend that this ſo common, true, and authoriz'd ſenſe by cuſtom never entred into the thoughts of any man during eight hundred years.</hi> All this ſignifies nothing, ſeeing his pretended ſenſe is contrary to nature, the queſtion concerning Bread which a man ſeeth, and which all the notices of ſenſe and reaſon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to be Bread, theſe ſame notices do not inform us that 'tis not Bread, or that 'tis only an appearance of it. The queſtion likewiſe concerning a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which we know is in Heaven, and which is like unto that which we have, the notices of reaſon urge not a man to underſtand that this Body is there under the appearance of Bread. So that ſhould we ſuppoſe that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring eight hundred years this ſenſe entred not into any bodies thoughts, we ſhall ſuppoſe nothing but what's very natural and reaſonable. <hi>But,</hi> ſays Mr. <note place="margin">Page 582.</note> 
                           <hi>Arnaud, when</hi> Raphael <hi>led young.</hi> Toby, <hi>if any one that knew who he was ſhould ſay, this Man whom you ſee is an Angel,</hi> Toby <hi>would not have imagin'd that he was both Man and Angel too; but eaſily conceive he meant only, that appearing Man he was really an Angel.</hi> But does not Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> conſider that this example is quite different from our caſe? When the Angels appear'd under the form of men, there was always ſome ſenſible character that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd them, and eaſily ſhew'd there was ſomething more than natural in 'em. There's nothing like this in the Bread, th' apparition of Angels in a humane ſhape, was very frequent under the old Teſtament, and <hi>Toby</hi> was inſtructed in his infancy in the belief of this. This apparition of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt under the form of Bread was unheard of in the Church. We know that an Angel leaves Heaven, when he comes to appear on Earth in a humane ſhape; whereas we know on the contrary that the Body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is ſo in Heaven that it will not leave that place till the laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We know an Angel is of a ſpiritual nature, and a man conſults not his eyes to know whether he is preſent or not; but we know that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is of a ſenſible nature, th' object of our ſight and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Had then any one ſaid to <hi>Toby, This man whom you ſee is an Angel,</hi> perhaps <hi>Toby</hi> had taken this propoſition in Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s ſenſe, becauſe he would have been led to it, by what I now come from repreſenting touching th' appearance of Angels. But ſuppoſe as we ought to ſuppoſe in this place of our diſpute a man that knows not as yet the Doctrin of Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor that of Conſubſtantiation; that knows not the Principles of it, that never heard of it, nor of an appearance of Bread without its ſubſtance, nor of a humane Body, impalpable, inviſible, and exiſtent in ſeveral places at a time; and moreover, knows that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Let this man be told the Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, 'tis certain that the light of reaſon will never lead him to this violent explication, <hi>That that which appears Bread, and is not, is the very Body of Jeſus Chriſt in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi>
                           <pb n="149" facs="tcp:41961:271"/> As to the reſt, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ought not to abuſe ſeveral paſſages of <hi>Calvin, Beza,</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> diſputing againſt thoſe called <hi>Lutherans.</hi> Their ſenſe is, that if theſe words, <hi>this is my Body,</hi> may be literally underſtood, we muſt rather admit the ſenſe of the Roman Church than that of the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans. But it does not hence follow that the ſenſe of the Roman Church is the moſt natural one, nor that the people muſt find it of themſelves; this conſequence does not any ways follow.</p>
                        <p>SO that here are two of the ranks of perſons which I aſſerted delivered from the unjuſt purſuits of Mr. <hi>Arnaud: The third,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is leſs trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 6. ch 8. pag. 586.</note> 
                           <hi>than the others.</hi> Why? <hi>Becauſe,</hi> adds he, <hi>it conſiſts only of perſons that believed the Real Preſence, and had a diſtinct Faith of it?</hi> This rank is of thoſe, <hi>who going as far as the queſtion, How the Sacrament is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt? proceeded alſo to the ſolution of it; but their minds ſtopt at ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral terms, as that Jeſus Chriſt is preſent to us in the Sacrament, and that we receive therein his Body and Blood without ſearching a greater light. 'Tis certain,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud, there might be in effect faithful perſons in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church that penetrated no farther into this Myſtery than barely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Jeſus Chriſt is therein preſent, and that we receive therein his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood.</hi> God be praiſed that we have at length once ſaid ſomething which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does not contradict. And to return him the ſame kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs do tell him, that what he grants here does not at all diſpleaſe me. For this plainly ſhews there were faithful people in the ancient Church that knew nothing of Tranſubſtantiation, but conceiv'd only a Preſence of Jeſus Chriſt in the Sacrament, and a reception of his Body and Blood under a general notion: yet Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> pretends that this notion, how general ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it might be, was diſtinctly the Real Preſence. Which is what I deny, and muſt examin. The queſtion is then only whether theſe perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd diſtinctly the Real Preſence, he pretends it and I deny it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>THEY knew,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud, neither the key of Figure, nor the key of</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Page 587.</note> 
                           <hi>Virtue, according to the Hypotheſis it ſelf. So that neither the preſence of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, nor the preſence of figure came into their thoughts.</hi> I grant it. <hi>What preſence then could they conceive but the Real Preſence, but the Real Recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? And why muſt they have given to theſe words another ſenſe than that which they naturally have?</hi> This is ill concluded. They would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a confus'd and general idea of Preſence without deſcending to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and preciſe diſtinction. I confeſs 'tis very hard for perſons that have their ſight, and never ſo little of common ſenſe, not to acknowledg that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is not in the Euchariſt in this ordinary and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real manner, by which a body is naturally in one place: and I am ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſuaded that thoſe perſons in queſtion could not come ſo far as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how the Euchariſt is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, without conceiving the idea of his viſible and ſenſible Preſence to reject it: but we ſhall ſuppoſe nothing that is unreaſonable, in ſaying that in carrying off their thoughts from this corporeal Exiſtence, they conceiv'd it preſent under a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed notion; for 'tis a uſual thing with perſons that are unlearned, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider things in a confuſed manner; and therefore we commonly ſee they cannot expreſs themſelves otherwiſe than in certain obſcure and general terms, which do never well ſhew what they have in their minds. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deny'd but this kind of confuſed ideas are uſual among people. But Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> muſt not imagin that theſe perſons of whom we ſpeak believed the ſubſtantial Preſence of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in the Sacrament, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41961:272"/> the idea of the corporal Preſence, as 'tis likely they did by the very inſtinct of nature, to maintain they believ'd a ſubſtantial Preſence, we muſt ſuppoſe either that they had the idea of another manner of ſubſtantial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a body than the corporeal one, or at leaſt that they knew there was ſome other which was not leſs a ſubſtantial Preſence than the corporeal one, altho they knew it not. Now of theſe two ſuppoſitions the firſt is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be falſe by Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> himſelf, and the ſecond is wholly contrary to reaſon; for who ſhould inform them there was another manner of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial preſence of a body than a corporeal one? Nature ſhews us no other, the expreſſions of their Paſtors mention'd no other; whence then muſt they have it? It muſt then be ſaid they had a confuſed idea of another manner of preſence than the ſubſtantial one, they beheld it in the expreſſions of their Paſtors, felt it in the motions of their Conſciences; but to denote pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely what that was, was what they could not otherwiſe do than by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral terms of preſence, reception, and ſuch like. Now this was in effect to believe not a ſubſtantial Preſence, but a Preſence of union, a Preſence of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary efficacy, in reference to the Soul, altho they comprehended it not in its full diſtinction.</p>
                        <p>THE fourth rank is of thoſe <hi>who after they had been puzled with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency of the terms of Bread and Body of Jeſus Chriſt, found the real knot of this difficulty, to wit, that the Bread is the Sacrament, the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial and pledg of the holy Body of our Redeemer. They found it,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud, becauſe it pleaſes Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>to ſuppoſe ſo, but 'twas after a long ſearch.</hi> My ſuppoſition contains nothing but what we ſee happens every day in the world. 'Tis certain there are perſons who be full of doubts, this is no wonder, and we find 'em not ſo eaſily freed from them; they eſteem themſelves happy when after a long ſearch they get them reſolved. What extraordinary matter is there then in this ſuppoſition.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T whilſt they were in ſearch of it, and could not find it,</hi> adds Mr. <hi>Arnaud, dares Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>ſay their minds were not ſmitten with any idea of the Real Preſence by all the paſſages and inſtructions of the Fathers. They never knew of any key of Virtue, or Figure, how then underſtood they the words of the Fathers which aſſured them that the Lamb of God is preſent on the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſtical Table; that the Bread appearing Bread was not ſo, but the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; that we drink the immortal Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; that the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt is added to ours; that it enters into us; that this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Body, which is diſtributed to ſo many thouſands is entire in each of 'em; that 'tis the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt in truth; that we muſt not doubt of it, ſeeing he has ſaid ſo himſelf; that altho what we ſee has nothing like to a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man body, yet none refuſe to believe what Chriſt himſelf has aſſerted to be true; that the Bread is changed into the very Body of Jeſus Chriſt; that the Bread is made the Body of Jeſus Chriſt by the ineffable operation of the Holy Spirit; that we muſt not look for the uſual courſe of nature in the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>cannot defend himſelf from theſe paſſages, but by applying to 'em his keys of Virtue and Figure, and enduring a thouſand vexatious oppoſitions. Now theſe perſons being ſtrangers to theſe inventions, conceived the literal idea of theſe words, they conceived that Jeſus Chriſt entred into us, that 'twas not Bread, but the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, that 'twas not to be queſtion'd; that they ought to give their ſenſes the lye: and thus during all the time of this ſearch, they had maugre Mr.</hi> Claude, <hi>the Real Preſence ſtill in their minds.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="151" facs="tcp:41961:272"/>
                        <p>TO make this arguing good, there muſt be ſeveral things ſuppoſed, which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> himſelf will not approve to be reaſonable. Firſt, we muſt ſuppoſe that thoſe of this fourth rank now in queſtion, had either heard a great part of the Fathers preach, which the Roman Church alledges in her own favour as well Greeks as Latins of ſeveral Ages, or read almoſt all their Writings concerning the Euchariſt; for what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> now recited to us is a rhapſody of ſeveral expreſſions to be found here and there in <hi>Gelaſius</hi> of <hi>Cyzique, Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem, Chryſoſtom; Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nyſſe, Heſychius, Gaudencius, Epiphany, Damaſcen</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> Secondly, We muſt ſuppoſe they made an exact collection of all theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the Fathers which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> abuſes, and put them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make a better ſurvey of them, and grounded thereupon their difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Thirdly, We muſt ſuppoſe that thoſe of this fourth rank did all the ſame thing, or at leaſt, communicated this rhapſody to one another, to behold therein all of 'em the Real Preſence during the time of their doubting. Fourthly, We muſt ſuppoſe they took care to collect nothing that might carry off their minds from rhe Real Preſence, or offer 'em contrary objects.</p>
                        <p>LET Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> conſider, if he pleaſes, that thoſe of this fourth rank now in queſtion are a middle ſort of people, whom we ſuppoſe to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſmall reading, or ſtudy, who were not capable of making either for themſelves or fellows, collections of difficult paſſages, but only heard their Paſtors ſay that the Bread of the Euchariſt is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, or is made the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. For when we ſuppoſe perſons that knew all theſe expreſſions of the Fathers propoſed by Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> and that have collected 'em, 'twill be juſt to ſuppoſe likewiſe they were not ignorant that the Fathers taught alſo, <hi>That what we ſee on the Altar is Bread and Wine, creatures and fruits of the Earth; that they are ſigns and myſtical ſymbols of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; that theſe ſymbols leave not their own nature, but remain in their firſt ſubſtance; that our Saviour Chriſt has honored them with the name of his Body and Blood, not in changing their nature, but in adding grace to their nature; that Jeſus Chriſt as he is God is every where, but as Man is in Heaven; that his Body muſt be in one place; that when his Fleſh was on Earth it was not in Heaven, and that being now in Heaven, it is not certainly upon Earth; that the Bread is not properly his Body, nor the Wine his Blood, but ſo call'd, inaſmuch as they contain the myſtery of 'em; that our Saviour has made an exchange of names, having given to his Body the name of Symbol; that he has called the Bread his Body, to the end we might know that he whoſe Body the Prophet had anciently figured by Bread, has now given to Bread the figure of his Body.</hi> By this means when Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> pretends the former paſſages gave the idea of a Real Preſence, I may pretend like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that theſe laſt mention'd carried the ſame perſons off from it, and led 'em to a Sacramental ſenſe. But as I ſaid, it is not needful to put them of this fourth rank upon collecting paſſages out of the Fathers on either hand, ſeeing we ſuppoſe they were only meanly inſtructed in points of Religion.</p>
                        <p>TO finiſh this Chapter, and the defence of the ſecond, third, and fourth ranks of perſons which I ſuppoſed were in the ancient Church, we have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to anſwer in few words an objection which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has propoſed in his tenth Chapter, which reſpects theſe three ranks in general; I mean the ſecond, third, and fourth: which objection conſiſts in this, <hi>That there being two ſorts of doubts, the one in which a man underſtands and conceives a thing,</hi>
                           <pb n="152" facs="tcp:41961:273"/> 
                           <hi>but knows not whether it be or be not, whether 'tis poſſible or impoſſible; as when a man doubts whether Beaſts think, whether our blood circulates in the body; others wherein a man knows not what makes the doubt; as when one doubts of the cauſes of the flux and reflux of the Sea, or of the ſenſe of a paſſage of Scripture, when the ſenſe which appears is falſe, and yet a man ſees no other: there is this difference between theſe two ways of doubting that in the firſt, there's no need to have the thing explained to us, 'tis ſufficient we have proofs given us of it. But the ſecond which includes an ignorance of the manner, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily requires an explication. That the doubt or ignorance which Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>attributes to three of the ranks, which compoſe his ſyſtem, is of this ſecond kind, that is to ſay one of theſe doubts which have need of information and explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the manner of the thing, being the perſons in queſtion were offended at the inconſiſtency of theſe terms, Bread and Body, and knew not how it could be true, that the Bread was the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, or chang'd into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; ſo that their ignorance could not be cured, but by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'em the manner in which the Bread might be the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, to wit, in Figure aed Virtue. In the mean time the doubt againſt which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have pretended to fortifie the Faithful is removed by the ſame Fathers by confirming and ſeveral times repeating that the Euchariſt is the Body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt without the addition of an explication of Figure, or Virtue. Whence it follows, that the doubt they would take away is not in any wiſe that which Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>attributes to three of his ranks. For his doubt requires not proofs but illuſtrations, that is to ſay, the queſtion is not to prove the Euchariſt to be the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, but to explain in what ſenſe this is true. Now in all the paſſages of the Fathers wherein they mention a doubt, they are only ſolicitous to prove that the Euchariſt is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, without any elucidation, and they prove it by theſe words,</hi> Hoc eſt corpus meum: <hi>or by theſe,</hi> Panis quem ego dabo caro mea eſt, <hi>or by the divers examples of the Power of God, the Creation of the world, the Miracles of the Prophets, and by that of the Incarnation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I PRETEND not to examin here all the parts of this diſcourſe, 'twill be ſufficient to make ſome remarks which will clearly diſcover the imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of it. Firſt, The diviſion Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> makes of the doubts is inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the ſubject we are upon; for he ſhould again ſubdivide into two, the ſecond kind of doubt, and ſay that ſometimes thoſe that doubt in being ignorant of the cauſes or manner of the thing, yet do nevertheleſs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the truth of the thing it ſelf, and hold it for certain, altho they know not how it is. Thus when a man doubts of the cauſes of the flux, or reflux of the Sea, he yet believes that this flux and reflux is true. When Divines doubt of the manner after which God knows contingent matters, this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders 'em not from believing he knows them; and when they doubt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the manner in which the three perſons exiſt, in one and the ſame eſſence, this does not hinder them from believing that they do exiſt. But ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ignorance of the manner makes people doubt of the truth of the thing it ſelf. Thus <hi>Neſtorius</hi> not being able to comprehend how the two Natures make but one Perſon in Jeſus Chriſt, doubted of this truth, that there were in Jeſus Chriſt two Natures and one Perſon; and not only doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it, but deny'd it. Thus <hi>Pelagius,</hi> becauſe he could not underſtand how Grace operates inwardly on the hearts of the Faithful rejected this operation. We may call this firſt doubt a doubt proceeding from mere ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and the ſecond a doubt of incredulity. Secondly, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> takes no notice that the doubt which ariſes from the inconſiſtency of theſe
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:41961:273"/> terms, <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> ſo far prevail'd in the minds of ſome, as to make 'em doubt of the truth it ſelf of theſe words. How can this be, ſaid they, ſeeing we ſee Bread and Wine, and not Fleſh and Blood, <hi>Who will doubt,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Cyril Hieroſ. Catech. myſt. 1.</note> ſays <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem, and ſay, 'tis not his Blood? You will tell me, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,</hi> ſays the Author of the Book, <hi>De Initiatis, I ſee quite another thing, how will you perſuade me I receive the Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And the ſame kind of doubt we have obſerv'd among the Greeks of the 11th. Century in <hi>Theophylact, Quomodo inquit? caro non videtur:</hi> and in the 12th. in <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas Methonienſis;</hi> for he entitles his Book, <hi>Againſt thoſe that doubt and ſay the Conſecrated Bread and Wine are not the Body and Blood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Perhaps,</hi> ſays he, <hi>you doubt, and do not believe, becauſe you ſee not Fleſh and Blood, but Bread and Wine.</hi> Thirdly, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> takes notice, that when we have to do with theſe kind of doubters, who will not acknowledg the truth of the thing it ſelf, becauſe they are ignorant of the manner of it, we uſually take ſeveral ways to perſuade them; ſometimes we confirm the thing it ſelf, without expounding to 'em the manner, altho it be the ignorance of the manner which makes them doubt of the thing. Thus our Saviour ſeeing the doubt of the Capernaits, <hi>How can he give us his fleſh to eat?</hi> did not ſet about explaining the manner of this manducation to 'em, but oppoſes 'em by a reiterated affirmation of what he had told 'em. <hi>Verily, verly,</hi> ſays he, <hi>if you eat not the Fleſh of the Son of man and drink his Blood, you will have no life in you,</hi> &amp;c. Sometimes the explication of the thing and the manner of it are joyn'd together; and thus our Saviour dealt with the doubt of <hi>Nicodemus, How can a man be born when he is old; can he enter again into his Mothers womb and be born? Verily, verily,</hi> ſays our Saviour, <hi>I ſay unto you, unleſs a man be born of Water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> Theſe words do at the ſame time both confirm and explain. But when we have to do with doubters that are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant of the manner without calling into queſtion the truth of the thing, then we uſually explain only the manner without confirming any more the thing, becauſe this alone is ſufficient to inſtruct them; and 'tis thus the Angel beſpeaks the Virgin: <hi>How,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>can this be, for I know not a man? The Holy Spirit,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſhall come upon thee, and the virtue of the moſt high ſhall overſhadow thee; therefore alſo that holy thing which ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be called the Son of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>TO apply theſe things to the preſent occaſion, I ſay the Fathers had to do with two ſorts of Doubters; the one who were only ignorant of the manner, <hi>how the Bread is, or is made the Body of Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> but yet who held the propoſition to be true, altho they knew not the ſenſe of it: and they are thoſe that make up the third, ſecond, and fourth ranks in my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the <hi>Perpetuity:</hi> others who went ſo far as to call in queſtion the truth of the propoſition under pretence they underſtood not the manner of it. As to theſe laſt, ſuppoſing the Fathers contented themſelves with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times confirming their propoſition by the words of Jeſus Chriſt, who is Truth it ſelf, it muſt not be thought ſtrange; the nature of the doubt led 'em to this: yet is it true they have always added to the confirmation of the thing, the explication of the manner, as may be apparently juſtifi'd by ſeveral paſſages which we have elſewhere cited. But when they had only to do with the firſt ſort of Doubters, then they contented themſelves with explaining the manner, without preſſing the truth of the words. Thus does S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> (after he had propoſed the doubt of thoſe that were newly Baptiz'd, <hi>How is the Bread his Body, and the Wine his Blood?)</hi> make this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41961:274"/> 
                           <hi>My Brethren, theſe things are called Sacraments, becauſe that which we</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Serm. ad inf.</note> 
                           <hi>ſee is one thing, and that which we hear another; what we ſee has corporeal ſpecies, but what we hear has a ſpiritual fruit.</hi> To this end do all the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Fathers tend which declare how the Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, to wit, or becauſe 'tis the Sacrament of it, the ſign and figure, or becauſe it ſtands for it, or becauſe it communicates it to us, or becauſe Chriſt changes it into the efficacy of his Fleſh; and thoſe which term it the typical Body, the ſymbolical Body, the myſtical Body, and thoſe that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the words of Chriſt a Sacramental or figurative ſenſe; for theſe are as ſo many explications of the manner which ſerve to clear up the doubt in queſtion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D</hi>'s illuſion then is a double one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for on one hand what ought to be referred to one kind of doubt, he refers to another: what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to the doubt of incredulity which reſpects the truth of the words, he refers to the ſimple doubt of ignorance which conſiſts only in not knowing the manner how the Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt: and this illuſion is grounded on the imperfect diviſion which he has made of the doubts. On the other hand he ſuppreſſes whatſoever the Fathers have ſaid in order to th' explaining in what ſenſe the Sacrament is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and offers only what they have ſaid to confirm that it is ſo. As to the paſſages he propoſes, he ſhews but ſmall ſincerity in telling us the Fathers add no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of figure or virtue; for the greateſt part of thoſe he alledges ſpeak either of the Type, or Figure, or Sacrament, or ſpiritual Underſtanding, or Virtue. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>the type of Bread,</hi> and <hi>of the type of Wine.</hi> The Author of the Treatiſe <hi>De Initiatis</hi> concludes that <hi>'tis the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Gaudencius ſays, <hi>That the Bread is the figure of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. Chryſoſtom</hi> ſays that God gives us in the Sacrament <hi>the intelligible or ſpiritual things</hi> by means of ſenſible. And <hi>Heſychius</hi> recommends to our conſideration <hi>the virtue of the Myſtery, and ſpiritual underſtanding of it.</hi>

                        <p>Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D</hi> ſpends all the 11th. Chapter of his ſixth Book to ſhew that theſe perſons, whom I ſuppoſe had neceſſarily before their eyes
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:41961:274"/> a diſtinct idea of the Real Preſence. Which is what he endeavours to prove. Firſt, <hi>By the example of this infinite number of Chriſtians which were found to hold in the beginning of the 11th. Century the belief of the Real Preſence, and who had taken up this Faith from the ſame expreſſions of the Fathers which ever rung in the ears of the Faithful of the firſt eight Centuries; whence it without doubt follows that theſe expreſſions which have perſuaded the whole world into the belief of the Real Preſence, might well give the idea of it to thoſe which preceded them.</hi> Secondly, He offers the double idea which the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical terms offer to the mind, for <hi>they offer,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to the mind that which one would have it underſtand, and ſhew it at the ſame time the image by which one repreſents it. Thus this expreſſion of Scripture,</hi> Vicit Leo de tribu Juda, <hi>puts us upon thinking that Jeſus Chriſt is compared to a Lion by reaſon of his ſtrength; ſo that the word Lion forms at the ſame inſtant in the mind two ideas, that of the ſtrength of Chriſt which is the natural idea of the thing conceiv'd as true, and which the Scripture would ſignifie, and the idea of a Lion which is the natural idea of the Word, but which is only the reſemblance of the truth which the Scripture would make us conceive. It is eaſie,</hi> ſays he moreover, <hi>to conclude hence that when a man ſhould take all the words of the Fathers which expreſs the Real Preſence for metaphorical ones, when one ſhall give 'em all the ſenſes which the Miniſters give them, and ſuppoſe that the Faithful of the fifth Rank were all of 'em born every whit as metaphorical as</hi> Aubertin <hi>was after he had corrupted his judgment by vain wranglings for thirty years ſpace, when we ſhould grant they had all an infuſed knowledg of 'em, and had 'em alſo as preſent as the firſt Principles, they could not but ſee the Real Preſence in the expreſſions of the Fathers, either as the true idea which they would mark, or as the image of this idea, but an image ſo lively and ſenſible, and denoted by ſuch a great number of expreſſions, that 'tis impoſſible but their mind muſt have been touch'd with 'em.</hi> Thirdly, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> uſes for the ſame deſign the example of other Miniſters, <hi>Who conceiv'd,</hi> ſays he, <hi>a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral ſenſe in the paſſages produc'd by the Catholicks.</hi> In fine he uſes for this end the very paſſages of the Fathers, and eſpecially one of S. <hi>Hilary,</hi> and another of <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nyſſe.</hi> We ſhall anſwer in order theſe four preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded reaſons.</p>
                        <p>AS to the firſt which is taken from th' example of the people of the 11th. Century, it is evidently ineffectual by means of two eſſential differences there are between theſe people, and thoſe of the eight firſt Centuries. The firſt is, that the idea of the Real Preſence, I mean of that about which we diſpute, was offered to thoſe of the 11th. Century by the Diſciples and followers of <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> who maintain'd, and taught it, and applied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the paſſages of the Fathers, dazling the eyes of the world by falſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and giving to theſe paſſages a ſenſe which the people would never have diſcovered, had they been led by the light of nature. But there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſaid like this of the people of the eight firſt Centuries, to whom the idea of this ſubſtantial and inviſible Preſence was not yet diſcovered. They had not been taught it, nor were they told 'twas in this ſenſe they muſt take the expreſſions of their Paſtors. Moreover, the people of the 11th. Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury had not the clear and eaſie paſſages of the Fathers propoſed to 'em, which might give the true meaning of the Sacrament, and at the ſame time ſerve for an explication to the obſcure expreſſions, and by this means ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'em only one ſide of the thing, and making 'em conſider it in wrong circumſtances, 'twas no hard matter for 'em to be deceiv'd, and take that for a Real Preſence which was far from being it. But we muſt make another

                           <pb n="156" facs="tcp:41961:276"/> judgment of the eight firſt Centuries, wherein the Paſtors inſtructing their flocks, gave them other ideas of this myſtery, which carried them off from that of the inviſible and incorporeal Preſence.</p>
                        <p>We may in a manner apply the ſame anſwer to Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s third rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which is taken from the example of ſeveral Miniſters, who altho they pretend that the true ſenſe of the paſſages of the Fathers produc'd by thoſe of the Roman Church, is the metaphorical one, yet do conceive the literal ſenſe. For there is a great deal of difference between us and the people of the eight firſt Centuries. They lived in thoſe times wherein the idea of the Real Preſence, ſuch as the Roman Church believes, was not diſcovered; whereas we live in thoſe times wherein 'tis continually repreſented before our eyes. Both Rhetorick and Philoſophy are ſet on work to ſhew it us in the Writings of the Fathers. 'Tis not poſſible then but entering into the ſenſe of thoſe that diſpute inceſſantly againſt us, and putting our ſelves in their places to comprehend what they think, but we muſt conceive in the paſſages which they alledg to us, the ſenſe of the Real Preſence, altho we judg it to be falſe. 'Tis alſo true that they offer ſome to us under the name of the Fathers, which as Mr. <hi>Daillé</hi> has well obſerv'd, <hi>ſeem in no wiſe to admit the ſenſe of the Proteſtants.</hi> But theſe paſſages are of two kinds, for either they are falſly attributed to the Fathers, as is that denoted by Mr. <hi>Daillé, That the Bread changes its nature, and becomes by the Almighty Power of God the Fleſh of the Word,</hi> which he has conſider'd as the words of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> under whoſe name they have been uſually cited, whereas they are <hi>Arnaud</hi> of <hi>Bonneval</hi>'s, an Author of the 12th. Century. As to ſuch as theſe I confeſs 'tis not eaſie for Proteſtants to accommodate them to their ſenſe, but very eaſie on the contrary to conceive the idea of the Real Preſence in 'em; but this happens by their being regarded as the words of the Fathers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as indeed they be not. The others are really the ſayings of the Fathers, but contain a particular ſentiment, which is neither that of the Roman Church nor that of the Proteſtants; ſo that it cannot ſeem ſtrange if thoſe that would accommodate them to the ſenſe of the Proteſtants found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves perplexed with 'em; and ſuch are ſeveral paſſages in <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nyſſe, Anaſtaſius Sinaite,</hi> and <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> which to ſpeak properly, are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor for us; I mean, do neither confirm our poſitive belief nor theirs, altho they alledg them in their own favour.</p>
                        <p>AS to what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſays touching the metaphors, I grant they do naturally form this double idea of which he ſpeaks; but he is not ignorant there are, as I ſaid, metaphorical terms, which uſe has made proper: ſo that they do not of themſelves offer to the mind the natural idea which they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, but only the metaphorical one; unleſs a mans mind makes a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular reflection on them. Thus the term of Houſe in Aſtrology, the term of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> in a Library, and I know not how many others of this nature, do not preſent more to the mind than the idea of the things which they originally ſignifie. Let Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> call them as long as he will equivocal terms, dark metaphors which are aboliſh'd by uſe, this does not hinder the truth of my remark, nor th' application which I made of it to the terms of <hi>Corpus, Corpus Domini, Corpus Chriſti,</hi> which uſe had made ſo proper to the Sacrament, that they brought no other idea to the mind than that of the Sacrament, according as our ſenſes repreſent it, without bringing in that of the natural Body of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>It is true,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Page 602.</note> 
                           <hi>that the cuſtom of employing ſome terms in a metaphorical uſe does ſometimes</hi>
                           <pb n="157" facs="tcp:41961:276"/> 
                           <hi>in ſuch a manner obſcure the double idea, that the mind feels no more than the impreſſion of the thing ſignifi'd and conceiv'd as true.</hi> This is exactly what I would have. I deſire no more, and it ſignifies nothing to alledg <hi>that this does not contradict the rule which the Author of the Perpetuity had propoſed, becauſe he ſpake only of terms which were really metaphorical, and not of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal terms, ſuch as thoſe are wherein the double idea is not felt.</hi> This, I ſay, ſignifies nothing, for beſides that the Author of the Perpetuity had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his Principle a little too generally, my exception invalidates the uſe which he would make of it; for it ſhews that in applying this Principle to the terms, <hi>Corpus, Corpus Domini, Corpus Chriſti,</hi> a man can draw no advantage thence, nor ſay that they brought into the mind the idea of the Real Preſence, becauſe that in effect theſe terms did not repreſent more than the idea of the Sacrament, according as our ſenſes offer it.</p>
                        <p>I confeſs we cannot apply this remark to ſeveral paſſages of the Fathers, wherein the figure is more ſenſible; and therefore we have only apply'd it to theſe terms preciſely, <hi>Corpus, Corpus Domini, Corpus Chriſti,</hi> by which the Sacrament has been often deſign'd. An anſwer is not the leſs good for being proper and particular to a ſubject. And as to other paſſages which the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> propoſed, we have already maintain'd, and do ſtill, that their natural ſenſe was the Sacramental one, and not that of the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, excepting ſome which we will ſpeak to hereafter. And for the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of this, we muſt firſt diſtinguiſh the particular ſenſe of each term, from the ſenſe of the whole propoſition; each term has its proper common and ordinary ſignification, and being thus taken apart, brings na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally into the mind the idea of that which it ſignifies. But the firſt and natural ſenſe of th'entire propoſition muſt not always be taken from the natural ſignification of each term, but oft-times from the force of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in queſtion which guides nature to a certain ſenſe, without ſuffering her to imagin any other: and this is oft the metaphorical ſenſe, which I illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by th' example of theſe propoſitions, <hi>The Stone was Chriſt, The King is the head of Gold, The ſeven ſtalks are the ſeven years.</hi> The particular terms <hi>Stone, Chriſt, was,</hi> taken apart do naturally bring into the mind the idea of what they ſignifie. The <hi>Stone</hi> offers the idea of a Rock, <hi>Chriſt</hi> the idea of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>was,</hi> gives the idea of an affirmation, but the ſimple and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe which reſults from theſe three terms gathered together, is no other than the metaphorical one, by reaſon of the matter in hand, which ſuffers not naturally the mind to conceive another. 'Tis the ſame in reference to theſe propoſitions, <hi>The Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, the Bread is made the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, the Bread is chang'd into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, the Body of Jeſus Chriſt enters into us, we receive the Body of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſuch like. If a man conſiders each term of theſe in particular, they na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally bring into the mind the idea of what they ordinarily and commonly ſignifie, the <hi>Bread,</hi> that of Bread, <hi>the Body of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>is,</hi> that of an affirmation, <hi>changed,</hi> that of a change, <hi>enter and receive,</hi> that of an entrance, and reception: But the ſenſe which reſults from theſe terms collected being determin'd by the matter in hand, can be naturally no other than a myſtical ſenſe, to wit, that the Bread is the Sacrament, the ſign, the pledg, the memorial of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; that it ſerves us inſtead of it, that 'tis myſtically chang'd into this Body, that this Body enters into us by its ſymbol, that we receive and partake of it by a ſpiritual reception and participation. This is the true and natural
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:41961:277"/> ſenſe of theſe expreſſions, and that which firſt preſents it ſelf to the mind by reaſon of the matter in hand.</p>
                        <p>NEITHER the truth of my Principle, nor the truth of the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which I make of it can be diſputed me. The Principle is, that when the matter in queſtion determins the propoſitions to a certain ſenſe which they may reaſonably receive, then we muſt not ſeek for the natural ſenſe of theſe propoſitions in the natural ſignification of each term taken apart, but from the matter it ſelf; and that the ſenſe to which the matter determins them is the ſimple and natural ſenſe. This Principle may be juſtifi'd by a thouſand examples drawn from the ordinary uſe of human ſpeech, in which is made every moment propoſitions, which would be ſenſleſs did not a man take the natural ſenſe of the matter in queſtion. Each Art and Profeſſion has alſo its particular expreſſions which would be as ſo many extravagancies, were they not underſtood according as the matter determins them; and this is in my opinion, what no one can contradict. Th' application which I make of this Principle is no leſs undeniable; for 'tis true that the expreſſions of the Fathers on the Euchariſt are determin'd to a certain ſenſe by the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Euchariſtical action, which is a Sacrament or a myſtery of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt: Seeing then their expreſſions are capable of receiving a Sacramental and myſtical ſenſe, it muſt be granted that that is the natural ſenſe.</p>
                        <p>THE natural ſenſe of a propoſition is that which may be moſt naturally in the mind of him that made it; but to judg well of it, we muſt conſider the matter, and ſee whether it has not led them to explain themſelves in this manner. Now it will be granted me that the queſtion here being about ſigns or myſtical ſymbols, and a Spiritual Communion which we have with Jeſus Chriſt, men have more naturally in their thoughts the myſtical and Sacramental ſenſe than that of Tranſubſtantiation, or Conſubſtantiation.</p>
                        <p>BUT beſides this diſtinction which reſpects the expreſſions both in themſelves, and in relation to thoſe that have uſed them, there muſt be made another, which regards the perſons to whom theſe expreſſions are addreſſed. For there are ſome that have ſmall knowledg of the matter in hand, which know only confuſedly what a Sacrament or myſtery is, who have made lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reflection on the manner after which our Lord communicates himſelf to us in the Euchariſt; and there are others that have this knowledg more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and better form'd. Now it being the matter or ſubject in hand that determins the ſenſe of theſe expreſſions, 'tis certain they are more or leſs clear, more or leſs intelligible, according as this matter is more or leſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by every one: But 'tis likewiſe certain, that to mark well the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe of 'em, we muſt ſuppoſe perſons who have a diſtinct knowledg of the ſubject in queſtion, and manner after which the Church has expreſſed her ſelf about it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not ignorant perſons that have only a very obſcure notion of it. The natural ſenſe of th' expreſſions of each Art, and each Profeſſion is without doubt not that in which thoſe may take it, who have ſcarcely any knowledg of this Art, or this Profeſſion but that wherein intelligent and able perſons take it; and 'tis for this reaſon the later are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted rather than the others upon any difficulty. I confeſs Religion ought to be the Art and Profeſſion of the whole world, but men are neither wiſe nor honeſt enough to apply themſelves exactly to it. It cannot be deny'd but there have been always many perſons in the Church little advanced in
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41961:277"/> the knowledg of the myſtery of the Goſpel. 'Tis not from them then that we muſt learn the natural ſenſe of the expreſſions of the Fathers. They might have been the object of their Faith, tho not of their Underſtanding. I mean, they might believe 'em to be true without diving into the ſenſe of 'em, and knowing what they ſignifie. And this is the meaning of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> in his Sermon to Children. <hi>What ye ſee,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is Bread and Wine, which your eyes likewiſe tell you, but the inſtruction which your Faith demands is, that the Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Cup, or that which is in the Cup his Blood. This is ſaid in a few words, and perhaps this little is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to Faith, but Faith deſires to be inſtructed; for the Prophet ſays, If ye do, not believe, how will you underſtand? Ye may reply, ſeeing you have comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us to believe, explain to us what that is, to the end we may underſtand it.</hi> Whilſt theſe perſons remain in this degree of Faith without underſtanding, 'tis not to them we muſt addreſs our ſelves for the finding out the natural ſenſe of the propoſitions of the Fathers, ſeeing they do not underſtand 'em. We muſt deſire this of them that are more advanced in knowledg, who know what the Church means by theſe ways of ſpeaking, and can give a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the natural impreſſion they make on their minds.</p>
                        <p>BUT who are theſe people? They are thoſe that learn'd from the Fathers themſelves, what a Sacrament or Myſtery is, who knew <hi>that a Myſtery or Sacrament is when we ſee a thing, and underſtand and believe another, who knew that the Bread and Wine of the Euchariſt are ſigns, images, figures, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials, repreſentations, reſemblances, pictures of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who knew, <hi>that the Bread and Wine are to us inſtead of the Body and Blood, that Jeſus Chriſt is ſignified and communicated to us by means of theſe ſymbols, and that in partaking of this viſible Bread we ſpiritually eat our Lords Fleſh,</hi> who knew, <hi>that the ſigns take commonly the names of the things which they repreſent, that the Sacraments are called after the name of the things themſelves, that our Saviour did not ſcruple to ſay, This is my Body, when he gave the ſign of his Body, that he made Bread his Body in ſaying, This is my Body, that is to ſay, the figure of my Body, that we muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the Bread of our Lord, and the Bread which is the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that the conſecrated Bread is honored with the name of our Lords Body, altho the nature of Bread remains, that the nature or ſubſtance of Bread ceaſes not to be, and that that which we celebrate is the image or reſemblance of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who knew, <hi>that the humanity of Jeſus Chriſt is local, abſent from Heaven when on the Earth, and left the Earth when it aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded up into Heaven, that to eat the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt is to believe in him, that this locution is figurative, and muſt not be taken according to the letter, ſignifying we muſt communicate of our Lords Paſſion, and call to remembrance that his Fleſh has been Crucified for us.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>'TIS ſuch kind of perſons as theſe who are well inſtructed in the ſenſe of the Fathers, that are to be conſulted to find the natural ſenſe of theſe other expreſſions which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> alledges in his favour. What likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is there that with theſe preparatives which they receiv'd daily from their Paſtors they ſhould ſtick at theſe expreſſions they heard 'em uſe, <hi>That the Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, that 'tis made the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, changed into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt enters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, that we are refreſh'd with his Blood, and nouriſh'd with his Fleſh,</hi> and other expreſſions of this nature; what likelihood is there they ſhould heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate at 'em, or ſee any other ſenſe in 'em, than the Sacramental or figurative
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:41961:278"/> one? Now theſe are the perſons whereof my fifth rank conſiſts, whom I ſuppoſed to have a knowledg of the truth more diſtinct and clear than the others, and a mind better fitted to underſtand the ſtile, and ordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the Church. Let the ſame inſtructions, the ſame expoſitions be given now to the people which the Fathers gave them, let neither Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, nor the Real Preſence, nor the converſion of the ſubſtance of Bread into the very ſubſtance of Chriſts Body, nor the Body of Jeſus Chriſt concealed under the vail of accidents without a ſubject, nor th'exiſtence of theſe accidents without a ſubject, nor the real exiſtence of the Body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in ſeveral places, nor his double Preſence, that is to ſay, his viſible and inviſible one, nor his Sacramental ſtate after the manner of a Spirit be mention'd, let 'em not be enjoyn'd t' adore the Sacrament of the Euchariſt with that Sovereign adoration which is due to Jeſus Chriſt alone; and in a word, let all things be ſuppreſs'd which we find the Fathers did not ſpeak or do, and let the impreſſions and prejudications which theſe novelties have introduc'd into mens minds be loſt: let the ſame inſtructions and expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I ſay, be given to the people now which the Fathers gave them, and then let 'em be told as long as you will, that the Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, that 'tis chang'd into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; for I am perſuaded, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every reaſonable man will be ſo too, that the people will never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from theſe expreſſions either Tranſubſtantiation, or Conſubſtantiation, but underſtand 'em, without difficulty in a Sacramental ſenſe. Where! Where's then this great <hi>noiſe</hi> which the Real Preſence made, <hi>knocking,</hi> as the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> words it, <hi>millions of times at the gate of the hearts of all the Faithful?</hi> Is not this clatter a mere dream, and has Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> any reaſon to reproach me with <hi>the deafneſs of my ears?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT 'twill perhaps be queſtion'd, whether perſons of mean capacity (whom we do not ſuppoſe to have this knowledg of the ſtyle and ſenſe of the Church) did not receive by theſe words th' impreſſion of the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. I anſwer, we ſhall do 'em no wrong by ſuppoſing they did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them: <hi>You have commanded us to believe,</hi> ſaid they in S. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Serm. ad inf.</note> 
                           <hi>explain to us then, how the Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, to the end we may underſtand it.</hi> They did not underſtand it then before the explication. In effect the greateſt part of the Fathers words taken literally are void of any natural ſenſe, Philoſophy muſt give 'em one; for how can we underſtand naturally that the Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, according to a literal ſenſe, or chang'd into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, ſeeing we behold it ſtill to be Bread? I confeſs there are ſome of theſe expreſſions which are apt to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to ignorant people the idea of a Real Preſence, but not of the real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible and incorporeal Preſence, touching which we contend, but on the contrary, the idea of a corporeal Preſence, for a mans mind, eſpecially that of an ignorant man, does not imagin th' exiſtence of a human, inviſible, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible, and impalpable Body. I moreover ſay, that this idea of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Preſence would be immediately rejected as falſe by the moſt ſtupid and ignorant, from the teſtimony of their own ſenſes, which they could not but conſult, ſuppoſing at leaſt they knew Chriſt's Body was a human one. But ſuppoſing they did not, 'tis likely their ſimplicity would lead them to believe that the natural Body of Jeſus Chriſt was really upon Earth in the form of Bread, ſuch as they ſaw in the Euchariſt: and this is what S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> ſays little Children would do were they earneſtly and gravely told 'tis the Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                        <p>AS to the paſſages of S. <hi>Hilary,</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nyſſe,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> alledges, as offering the idea of the Real Preſence, I confeſs the firſt is able to ſurprize th' ignorant, and make 'em conceive a corporeal Preſence; ſeeing it has theſe words, that Jeſus Chriſt is in us <hi>in reality of nature, and not by a ſimple conſent of will:</hi> and then again, that Jeſus Chriſt <hi>dwells in us naturally;</hi> which literally ſignifies that our Lords Fleſh exiſts in us in ſuch an ordinary and corporeal manner as the fleſh of animals exiſts in us when we eat 'em; which was the ſenſe wherein the Capernaits took the words of Jeſus Chriſt. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> himſelf ſeems to have acknowledg'd this, ſeeing he believ'd himſelf oblig'd to add in his Tranſlation a corrective that mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies or explains this term <hi>naturally. Naturally,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that is to ſay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</hi> But this, <hi>that is to ſay, really,</hi> ought not to be written in Italick, as if 'twere S. <hi>Hilary</hi>'s own explication; and if the fault be the Printer's, and not Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s, he ſhould at leaſt have ſet it in the Errata, becauſe it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes two illuſions at a time: on one hand it makes a man believe S. <hi>Hilary</hi> taught the Real Preſence of Jeſus Chriſt in us, in proper terms, ſeeing he ſays that he remains in us <hi>naturally, that is to ſay, really,</hi> which is not true: and on the other it hinders us from perceiving that the ignorant taking the <hi>naturally</hi> of S. <hi>Hilary</hi> according to the letter, would have had the idea of a corporal and natural Preſence, and not that of a ſpiritual and inviſible Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Theſe are a kind of faults for which people are not wont to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorry when they happen; for they have a deſir'd effect for ſome time, and when they chance to be diſcover'd may be laid on the Printer. But howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever 'tis certain that all the impreſſion which this paſſage of S. <hi>Hilary</hi> could make on the mind of an ignorant perſon was only to put him upon concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a corporal Preſence, which he might eaſily reject, by the teſtimony of his proper ſenſes. But to ſpeak the truth, there's little reaſon to ſuppoſe the Books of S. <hi>Hilary De Trinitate</hi> came to the knowledg of ſuch ignorant and ſimple people as we ſpeak of.</p>
                        <p>THE paſſage of <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nyſſe</hi> gives naturally the idea of a change of Bread into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, by the union of the Bread into the Word, and by way of augmentation of the natural Body of Jeſus Chriſt, as appears from the example which he brings of the Bread which Jeſus Chriſt ate, which became the Body of the Word, which is far remote from the Tranſubſtantiation of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who will have the ſubſtance on the Altar to be the ſame in number as that which our Saviour Chriſt aſſum'd from the Virgin, and which is now in Heaven. There's little likelihood that ſimple and ignorant people underſtood what <hi>Gregory</hi> meant, even ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing they were acquainted with his Catechiſm, which is not very likely. But ſuppoſing they knew it all by heart, and comprehended the ſenſe of it, they could thence only conceive this change by union to the word, and augmentation of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, which <hi>Damaſcen</hi> has ſince ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained more clearly. And this is what <hi>Gregory</hi> ſuppoſes alſo, not as the true Faith of the Church, but only as a probable opinion, according as he formally explains himſelf, <hi>Perhaps,</hi> ſays he, <hi>we are in the right.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>AND this is what we had to ſay concerning Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s ſixth Book. Whatſoever ſucceſs this Diſpute might have had, he could not thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe himſelf any advantage, becauſe as we have already obſerv'd more than once, the eight firſt Centuries being out of the time wherein we ſuppoſe the change was wrought, when he ſhall have proved the Real Preſence, or Real
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:41961:279"/> Abſence was diſtinctly held therein, he will be ſtill told the queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns not thoſe Ages, but the following. But 'tis not the ſame with me, who draw thence ſeveral advantages. For firſt, neither Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> nor the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> can henceforward prevail by the equivocation of the term of Real Abſence, which may be taken either for the rejection of the viſible or corporeal Preſence, or for the rejection of th' inviſible Preſence, ſeeing we have ſhew'd 'em that in this debate the queſtion concerns not the Real Abſence in the firſt ſenſe, but the Real Abſence in the ſecond. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, They can no longer confound theſe two things as if they were but one, to wit, to be in a condition to acknowledg that the Real Preſence does not agree with the lights of nature, and to be in a condition to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg 'tis a novely which was never held in the Church, ſeeing we have ſhew'd 'em there's a great deal of difference between theſe two diſpoſitions, and that it does not follow hence that thoſe who are in the firſt, are alſo in the ſecond, which is preciſely that which is here in queſtion. Thirdly, Neither will they I think any more confound two ſorts of very different doubts, the one of incredulity which deny the thing it ſelf, and the others of ſimple ignorance which conſiſt only in not knowing the manner, yet without denying the thing, ſeeing they have been ſhew'd clearly enough the difference of 'em, and that they ought not to refer to one of theſe doubts what belongs to the other. Fourthly, They can no longer blind the world by this vain diſtinction of three ways of rejecting the Real Preſence, or by a general rejection, without denoting any one kind of 'em, or by a formal rejection of all the kinds, or by a bare view of the nature of things, ſeeing we have ſhew'd 'em that the firſt is impoſſible, that the third brings no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to 'em, and that there's only the ſecond which they can reaſonably ſtick to, and which yet they renounce, becauſe they find it unjuſtifiable. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 'Tis likely they will no longer obſtinately maintain that a known in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency, that is to ſay, a pure impoſſibility, and reſpected as ſuch, is a ſenſe after th' illuſtrations given on this ſubject. Sixthly, They can no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſay that the ancient formulary of the Communion, <hi>Corpus Chriſti muſt neceſſarily</hi> direct the minds of the Faithful to conceive the Body of Jeſus Chriſt preſent in the Euchariſt which they receiv'd, ſeeing it had another uſe, which was to raiſe 'em up to meditate on the Death and Reſurrection of their Saviour; this other uſe being ſufficient to employ many of their minds. Seventhly, They will henceforward in vain pretend that the terms which the Fathers uſed in their ordinary inſtructions, brought naturally the idea of the Real Preſence into their Auditors minds, ſeeing we have ſhew'd that the natural ſenſe of their Propoſitions did not depend on the natural ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of each term, but on the matter in hand, which determin'd them to a figurative ſenſe. Eighthly, They have had no reaſon to pretend that all the Faithful have always had a diſtinct belief either of the Preſence or Real Abſence, in the ſenſe wherein the Roman Church underſtands theſe terms, ſeeing we have ſhew'd them five ranks of perſons in the Church of the firſt eight Centuries, who had no formal knowledg of either the one nor th'other. Ninthly, It being thus in reference to the firſt eight Centuries, it hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows 'twas the ſame by greater reaſon in the following, which were far dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker. Tenthly, And that which is moſt important is that one may already know by this, that the change which occaſions our principal queſtion has been not only poſſible, but eaſie. For there being only two things which can hinder it, the one the diſtinct belief of the Real Abſence, that is to ſay, the formal and poſitive belief that the Body is not in the Euchariſt by its proper ſubſtance, neither viſible nor inviſible; and th'other the knowledg,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:41961:279"/> diligence, and fidelity of the Paſtors, watching over their Flocks, ready to acknowledg and repel the new errors, and make them known to their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. 'Tis already apparent that the firſt of theſe things is an unjuſtifiable ſuppoſition, and contrary to all probability. And as to the other 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it calls in queſtion the credit of all Hiſtorians, and the judgment of all learned men who agree in this, that in the 9th. 10th. and 11th. Centuries th' Eccleſiaſtical order did not abound with famous men, and eſpecially the 10th. Century.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>HAVING conſider'd Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s 6th. Book, we muſt now in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der paſs on to the 9th. whoſe running Title is, <hi>The impoſſibility of the pretended Change of the Churches Belief in the Myſtery of the Euchariſt.</hi> 'Tis certain the genuine ſtate of the queſtion is only, whether this change has really hapned; this other, whether 'twas poſſible or impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, is a frivolous queſtion tending to fruitleſs Speculations and tedious Debates; which is what I clearly ſhew'd when I treated of the method of the <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> And which likewiſe ſeveral Roman Catholicks have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, who have written on this Subject ſince the Author of the <hi>Perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> Father <hi>Noüet</hi> was of opinion he had better lay aſide all this part of the <note place="margin">In his Preface.</note> Diſpute, and comprehend it under the Title of <hi>Particular Debates</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not concerned, nor ought to be mention'd. Mr. <hi>De Bauné</hi> in that elegant Letter which he publiſh'd under the name of an Eccleſiaſtick to one of his Friends, diſtinguiſhes likewiſe two quarrels where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſays I have engaged my ſelf, the one againſt the Real Preſence in the Euchariſt, and the other againſt the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> of the Faith: and he adds, <hi>that in this latter I only encounter with a particular perſon.</hi> Mr. <hi>Pavillon,</hi> a Prieſt and Almoner to his Majeſty ſpeaks his mind more fully in his triumph touching the Euchariſt. <hi>The queſtion is not t'examine whether</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Page 197.</note> 
                           <hi>the Church could change her belief, and how this change could happen; for this is a going about the buſt, and running upon whimſies. The queſtion is only to enquire whether this pretended change has effectually hapned.</hi> He calls all theſe pretenſions of impoſſibility frivolous queſtions, and mere whimſies; for theſe Gentlemen do one another right now and then. But howſoever Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has his maxims apart, and he obliges us to diſtinguiſh on this ſubject two queſtions; the one, whether the change before us has been poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; and the other whether it has really hapned. 'Tis certain that the firſt appears already very clear by the refutation of the pretended diſtinct knowledg of the Preſence, or Real Abſence, as we lately obſerved: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has treated of it only in reference to the eight firſt Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, without troubling himſelf with the following; yet 'tis eaſie to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that if it could not have place in thoſe Centuries, wherein there was greater light, it could not by ſtronger reaſon in the others, wherein there was a far greater and more general ignorance. Yet for better informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:41961:280"/> in this matter, we muſt ſee what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has offer'd touching this pretended impoſſibility of the change. We ſhall here then diſcuſs again the queſtion, whether in ſuppoſing that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> an Author of the ninth Century was the firſt that propoſed the Doctrin of the ſubſtantial inviſible Preſence of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in the Euchariſt, it might happen that this opinion in ſucceſſion of time has been receiv'd and eſtabliſh'd amongſt Chriſtians. For this is in fine what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> handles in his 9th. Book, and which we ſhall now examine. We ſhall not in truth find he has made uſe therein of great Arguments to confirm his Opinion, for he ſeldom troubles himſelf about that; nor has he exactly endeavour'd to refute the means of the poſſibility which I alledged, nor defended the Anſwers of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does not care to take ſo much pains. But we ſhall find he has taken care to collect here and there ſeven or eight paſſages out of my Book, and of them joyn'd together made a body, which he calls my <hi>Machins,</hi> and divided them into five orders, with titles according to his own fancy. He calls the firſt, <hi>The Machins of Abridgment;</hi> the ſecond, <hi>The Machins of Preparation;</hi> the third, <hi>The Machins of Mollifications;</hi> the fourth, <hi>The Machins of Execution;</hi> and the fifth, <hi>The Machins of Forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</hi> Now altho we may ſay in general that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s mind abounds with pleaſant fancies, by which he can eaſily find out odd names to make ſerious matters look ridiculous; yet t'excuſe him, we may ſay that in this occaſion he has follow'd, not his own natural inclination, but that of the Carteſian Philoſophy, with which his mind is ſaid to be extremely taken up; for you muſt know this Philoſophy makes Machins of every thing. But howſoever let's ſee what work Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> makes with mine.</p>
                        <p>THE firſt which he calls the Machin of retrenchment is taken out of two of my paſſages; the firſt of which bears, <hi>That the queſtion is not of the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Anſwer to the ſecond Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, Part 3. ch. 6. Book 9. ch. 3. p. 886.</note> 
                           <hi>whole world, but of the Weſt,</hi> on which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> makes this Commentary in my name, <hi>That is to ſay,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I will not have the queſtion concern it, I will not take the trouble t' explain how the Doctrin of the Real Preſence and Tranſubſtantiation has introduc'd it ſelf into the Eaſt, into the Patriarchats of</hi> Conſtantinople, Alexandria, Jeruſalem, <hi>and</hi> Antioch, <hi>into the Churches of the</hi> Armenians, Neſtorians, Jacobits. <hi>I do not care to trouble my ſelf with gueſſing how it has penetrated into</hi> Ethiopia, Moſcovia, Meſopotamia, Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, Mingrelia, Moldavia, Tartaria <hi>and the</hi> Indies. <hi>'Tis better to ſay, 'tis not there, this is ſooner done; and by this means I ſhall free my ſelf out of a great perplexity. But,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>will give us I hope leave to tell him, that he is a man and not God; ſo that neither his words nor his will are always effectual. He would not have the Doctrin of the Real Preſence to be in all theſe great Provinces. But it is there, and will be maugre him. The matter depends not on him, and we have demonſtrated it by proofs which I hope he will not queſtion.</hi> He fills five great pages with this kind of diſcourſe, ſaying over and over again the ſame thing.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D</hi> muſt pardon me if I tell him he has gotten a little too high. Is he ſo poſſeſs'd with the charms of his own Eloquence, and force of theſe illuſions touching the Greeks, Armenians, and other Eaſtern Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to imagin a man muſt be a God to cope with him? I think conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what we have obſerved, a man need neither be an Angel nor an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary perſon to demonſtrate again clearly that the queſtion concerns not theſe Churches, becauſe they do not at all believe the Roman Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation: and ſuppoſing they did believe it, which they do not, 'twould be
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:41961:280"/> no hard matter to find they had received it from the Latins by means of the Croiſado's, Seminaries, and Miſſions, which is ſufficient t' exclude them from this Diſpute.</p>
                        <p>THE ſecond paſſage from whence Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has taken my pretended Machin of Retrenchment, is this, <hi>The queſtion concerns not all thoſe in the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Anſwer to the ſecond Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, Part. 3. ch. 6.</note> 
                           <hi>Weſt, who profeſs themſelves Chriſtians, but only one party that have grown prevalent, and endeavoured to get the Pulpits to themſelves, thereby to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Rulers over the whole Church.</hi> Whereupon he cries out, <hi>Did ever any</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 9. ch. 3. p. 890.</note> 
                           <hi>body affirm that the common people of the 11th. Century held not the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and had only a confuſed knowledg of this Myſtery?</hi> But Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does not mind what he writes. We ſpeak of the firſt fifty years of the 10th. Century, and he comes and alledges to us the common people of the 11th. Century. <hi>'Tis ſufficient we tell him,</hi> ſays the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity, that</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">

                           <hi>this change cannot be attributed to the firſt fifty years of this Century,</hi> to wit, of the 10th. <hi>ſeeing 'tis incredible that the Faithful of the whole Earth having been inſtructed in the diſtinct belief of the Real Abſence, ſhould have embraced an Opinion quite contrary in condemning their firſt ſentiments, and without this change's having made any noiſe.</hi> Theſe are the very words I recited, and on which having ſaid, <hi>that the queſtion concerned not a change begun, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in the 10th. Century, but the progreſs of a change begun eighty two years before the 10th. Century, and finiſhed by the Popes towards the end of the 11th.</hi> I added, that <hi>our Debate was not about all thoſe in the Weſt that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves Chriſtians, but only about one party that ſtrengthned themſelves, and endeavour'd to become maſters of the Pulpit, that they might afterwards be maſters of the whole Church.</hi> It evidently appears the queſtion was about the firſt fifty years of the 10th. Century. And thereupon Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> tells us by way of exclamation, <hi>Is there any one that affirms the common people of the 11th. Century held not the Real Preſence, and had only a confus'd knowledg of this Myſtery? No,</hi> Berenger <hi>himſelf acknowledges the contrary in calling this Doctrin the Opinion of the people,</hi> ſententia vulgi, <hi>and in maintaining the Church was periſhed.</hi> It muſt be acknowledg'd there's a ſtrange diſorder in this kind of diſputing. I will grant that the common people of the 11th. Century held the opinion of the Real Preſence, thro the labours of <hi>Paſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> his Diſciples; but it does not follow 'twas the ſame in the firſt fifty years of the 10th. for when a new Doctrin diſperſes it ſelf in a Church, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty years make great alterations in it. When we ſpeak of the time in which <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> wrote his Book <hi>of the Body and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> 'tis not likely we ſuppoſe the people to be in the ſame ſtate they were in two hundred years after the opinion of the Real Preſence had made conſiderable progreſſes. Neither will we ſuppoſe 'em to be in the ſame ſtate the firſt fifty years of the 10th. Century; for when we ſpeak of a change which was made in the ſpace of near three hundred years, common ſenſe will ſhew there was more or leſs of it according to the diverſity of the time. It is then reaſonable on my hypotheſis to conſider in the beginning of the 10th. Century thoſe that held the Real Preſence, only as a party that ſtrengthened themſelves, and endeavour'd to make 'emſelves moſt conſiderable in the Church, but 'tis in no ſort reaſonable t' oppoſe againſt this the common people of the 11th. Century, ſeeing that in eighty, or an hundred years the face of things might be eaſily changed.</p>
                        <p>'TIS moreover leſs reaſonable to ofter us the diſcourſes of <hi>Lanfranc,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 9. ch. 3. pag. 890.</note> who bragg'd, that in his time all the Chriſtians in the world believed they
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:41961:281"/> receiv'd in this Sacrament <hi>the true Fleſh and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, born of the Virgin.</hi> For ſuppoſing what <hi>Lanfranc</hi> ſays were true, the ſence he gave to theſe words, <hi>the true Fleſh, and the true Blood of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> underſtanding them in a ſenſe of Tranſubſtantiation was falſe, as we have ſufficiently ſhew'd. <hi>Has any body charged this teſtimony to be falſe?</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud, No; there's no one but Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>who does it ſix hundred years after without any ground.</hi> But does Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> know all that <hi>Berenger</hi> anſwer'd, and thoſe that adher'd to him? And ſuppoſing they were ignorant of the true belief of the other Churches ſeparate from the Latin, does it hence follow that in effect they believed Tranſubſtantiation, and that the proofs I have given of the contrary be not good?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>DOES Reaſon,</hi> adds he, <hi>ſhew that in this point, the Faith of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid</note> 
                           <hi>was not that of the People?</hi> No; <hi>it proves the quite contrary, it being incredible that Miniſters who are perſuaded of the truth of the Real Preſence ſhould not take care t' inſtruct them in it, whom they exhorted to receive the Communion, to whom they ought to judg this belief to be abſolutely neceſſary to make them avoid the unworthy Communions.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> fights with his own ſhadow. We never told him that thoſe who believe the Real Preſence did not endeavour t' inſinuate it into the peoples minds, according as they were more or leſs prejudiced, or zealous in the propagation of this belief, and more or leſs qualifi'd to teach it, and more or leſs again according to the circumſtances of times, occaſions, perſons. But how does this hinder me from ſaying that during the firſt fifty years of the 10th. Century it was not all them that made profeſſion of Chriſtianity in the Weſt, but a party that ſtrengthened themſelves, and endeavour'd to render themſelves the moſt conſiderable.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>IS this,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> again, <hi>a ſufficient reaſon to ſhew that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were not perſuaded of the Real Preſence, becauſe ſome Hiſtorians who tell us that</hi> Berenger <hi>troubled the Church by a new Hereſie, do at the ſame time likewiſe inform us that he perverted ſeveral perſons with his novelties?</hi> But we did not offer this alone as a ſufficient reaſon to perſuade him the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did not believe the Real Preſence in the beginning of the 10th. Century. I confeſs that upon this alone one may juſtly ſay either that thoſe who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd <hi>Berenger,</hi> follow'd him in leaving their firſt Belief, and embracing a new Opinion, or that they follow'd him becauſe he Preach'd only what they believ'd before, or that they adher'd to him becauſe they were further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in a myſtery of which they had but ſmall knowledg, or little cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. So far every man is at liberty to take that part which he ſhall judg the moſt reaſonable: but ſhould I ſay there were ſeveral that follow'd him upon the account of their knowing what he taught was the ancient Doctrin, I ſhall ſay nothing but what's very probable, having ſhew'd, as I have done in my anſwer to the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> that <hi>Bertran</hi>'s Doctrin was publickly taught in the 10th. Century; for it follows hence probably enough, that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin was not then wholly extinct, that is to ſay, in the beginning of the 11th. Century, when <hi>Berenger</hi> appear'd.</p>
                        <p>THESE are Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s firſt objections, which as is plainly ſeen, are not over demonſtrative, that the change we ſuppoſe is impoſſible. Thoſe which follow are not much better, as will appear from the reflections we ſhall make on 'em.

Now he knows the contrary of this, and is perſuaded of it, ſeeing that as to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Myſteries, and ſuch as are believed by both Parties, and contained in the ancient Symbol, it cannot be ſaid they of the 10th.

                           <pb n="168" facs="tcp:41961:282"/> 
                           <hi>frankly acknowledg, that long before the 9th. and 10th. Century the whole Church believed what the Roman Church does believe at preſent of 'em. Let him tell us then what are theſe truths of Faith, the diſtinct knowledg of which were loſt in the 10th. Century.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>'TIS no hard matter to ſatisfie Mr. <hi>Arnaud.</hi> Theſe truths the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct knowledg of which was loſt in the 10th. Century are the ſame which are contained in the Symbols. Does he imagin that if a man be not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Symbols, that therefore he muſt know diſtinctly the Myſteries therein contained; and does he put no difference between being ignorant of a thing, conſuſedly knowing it, and diſtinctly knowing it? Do all thoſe that know the <hi>Creed,</hi> diſtinctly underſtand the Myſteries contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? Certainly a mans mind muſt be ſtrangely benighted that reaſons after this manner. <hi>They were not ignorant of the Myſteries contain'd in the ancient Symbols, they had then a diſtinct knowledg of 'em.</hi> If this Argument holds good we may attribute the diſtinct knowledg of the principal Points of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity almoſt to all kinds of perſons, to Artificers, Husbandmen, Women, yea Children; for there are few in either Communion but have heard of them, and know ſomething in 'em, and yet it muſt be granted there are few of theſe who can be properly ſaid to know them diſtinctly. I pretend not to treat here on the common place of the confuſed knowledg, and the diſtinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. This is needleſs. 'Tis ſufficient to obſerve that the term of diſtinct knowledg is equivocal; for 'tis ſometimes taken for the formal and expreſs knowledg of a thing, in oppoſition to the ignorance of this ſame thing, or to what the Schools call an implicit knowledg; and ſometimes 'tis taken for a clear and full knowledg, in oppoſition to a confuſed and perplex'd one. When the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> ſaid that all the Faithful ought always to have a diſtinct knowledg of the Preſence, or Real Abſence, he took the term <hi>diſtinct knowledg</hi> in the firſt ſenſe; for he did not mean that all the Faithful muſt know clearly and fully the Doctrin of the Real Preſence in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, but that they had a formal, expreſs and determinate thought of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting or admitting it. But when I ſaid that the diſtinct knowledg of the Myſtery of the Euchariſt, and almoſt all the other Myſteries of Chriſtian Religion was loſt in the 10th. Century, I took this term in the ſecond ſenſe, meaning not that there was no more formal knowledg of theſe Myſteries; that is to ſay, that they form'd no more any expreſs and determined thought on the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, and that Jeſus Chriſt is God and Man, that he was born of a Virgin, died for us, roſe again and aſcended up into Heaven, and that there is an Euchariſt; but meaning that they had only a very ſmall knowledg of them, ſuch as is common to perſons unlearned, and who rarely apply themſelves to meditate on matters of Religion; who go indeed for Chriſtians, but trouble themſelves with no more knowledg than barely to learn the Creed, and receive ſome other general Inſtructions. 'Tis eaſily perceived that this was my ſenſe, and that the ignorance I attribute to theſe perſons of the 10th. Century, from the concurrent Teſtimony of all Hiſtorians, was not ſo great as to keep 'em abſolutely from all knowledg of the principal Points of Chriſtian Religion, as if they were become Pagans, or Atheiſts, or bruit Beaſts, but that it hindred them from having that clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of apprehenſion and diſtinct knowledg, which comes by ſtudy and pains, and the hearing of able Preachers. Which will evidently appear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſulting the particular places of my Anſwer, wherein I treat of the 10th. Century; for I attribute to it a confuſed knowledg of the Myſteries of Religion. Now a confuſed knowledg is moreover a formal knowledg.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:41961:282"/> Elſewhere I compare their knowledg to that of a Child who is wont to ſee <note place="margin">Firſt Anſwer near the end.</note> his Nurſe, ill dreſt, lean and ſick, which ſtill ſuppoſes he ſees her, altho he ſees her not in her uſual condition. In another place I ſay <hi>the Paſtors grew</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Anſwer to the ſecond Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, Part 2. ch. 3. and Part 3. ch. 7.</note> 
                           <hi>careleſs of inſtructing the People, and the People likewiſe of informing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in matters of Religion; that there were few perſons that applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the meditating on the Chriſtian Myſteries; that the Paſtors extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglected th' inſtructing of the People, and that the People grew as careleſs as they in matters of their ſalvation.</hi> Now the meaning of all this is not that they wholly loſt all kind of knowledg, but that it was very ſcanty. In fine, 'twill appear this is my ſenſe to him that ſhall caſt his eyes on the uſe I pretend to make of the obſcurity of the 10th. Age, which was to ſhew that the people of it had not light enough to diſcern whether the Doctrin of the Real Preſence was an innovation in the Chriſtian Religion, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 'twas a Doctrin of the Fathers. Now this does not oblige a man to ſuppoſe an abſolute ignorance of the Chriſtian Myſteries, but that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of them was very confuſed. Which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> could have well enough ſeen, if he pleaſed; but he thought 'twere better to betake himſelf to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſms, imagining they would not be laid open, and that he might ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe the ſubject that few perſons ſhould be able to underſtand it. And 'tis on this Principle which is neither true, nor ſincere, that he has grounded this reaſoning, the common Myſteries held at this day by both Parties, and contained in the ancient Symbols were not unknown in the 10th. Century; therefore they of that Age had a diſtinct knowledg of the truths of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrin.</p>
                        <p>WHATSOEVER follows in his fourth Chapter turns upon the ſame equivocation. <hi>Did they leave off,</hi> ſays he, <hi>reading the Holy Scripture</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Page 892.</note> 
                           <hi>in the Churches and Cloiſters? Did they give over explaining of it to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and teaching it in the Schools? Do not the writings of thoſe Authors which we have that lived in that Century, ſuch as thoſe of S.</hi> Odon <hi>and</hi> Raterius <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Verone <hi>make it appear that the Scriptures and Fathers were ſtudied. Why does he ſay that the people had concealed from 'em the clear and ſolid expoſitions of the Fathers. Was not the Euchariſt therein called the Sacrament of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Jeſus Chriſt, the Myſtery of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, Bread and Wine?</hi> But all theſe interrogations are needleſs. A man may ſay they did not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely give over the reading of the holy Scripture, and expounding it. Perhaps <hi>Odon</hi> and <hi>Raterius</hi> were a little ſtudious. Perhaps the Euchariſt was called a Sacrament, a Myſtery, Bread and Wine; and yet it may not follow the People had a diſtinct knowledg of the points of Religion. The Greeks, Armenians, Moſcovites, Ethiopians, Jacobites, Neſtorians did not wholly lay aſide the reading of the Holy Scripture, and of ſome Fathers in their Church, and Cloiſters; and yet is it true that all theſe people, yea their very Monks and Prelates lived in a very confuſed knowledg of the myſteries of the Goſpel.</p>
                        <p>WHAT he adds touching ſome Hiſtorians, and Biſhops that wrote Books, is built on the ſame foundation. Beſides that there appears not any thing in theſe Authors but what is very mean, their ſmall number does well warrant our ſaying this Age was void of Learned men, and that people had but a very confuſed knowledg of the myſteries of the Goſpel.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>'TIS falſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that in this Age open War was denounced againſt the ſenſes.</hi> If this be falſe, how does he himſelf underſtand they taught Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:41961:283"/> in it? For can this Doctrin be taught without oppoſing the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of our ſenſes, ſeeing they ſhew us it is Bread and Wine?</p>
                        <p>BUT theſe ſmall objections are very inconſiderable in compariſon of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s grand pretenſion, which is, <hi>that this confuſed knowledg which I attribute to the 10th. Century, is but a mere empty ſound, whoſe ſenſe I my ſelf do not underſtand. In ſearching his Book,</hi> ſays he, <hi>in what ſenſe he took it, I found that confuſed knowledg and diſtinct knowledg are one and the ſame thing in his language, which is to ſay, that the knowledg which he calls confuſed is every whit as clear as that which he calls diſtinct.</hi> This diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very would be a very fine one indeed, were it not merely imaginary. 'Tis grounded on that deſcribing ſome-where the inſtructions of the Fathers of the eight firſt Centuries, I ſay, <hi>that they taught therein the Sacrament to be Bread and Wine, that this Bread and Wine were the ſigns and Figures of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, that they loſt not their natural ſubſtance, but were called the Body and Blood of Chriſt, becauſe they were the Sacraments of 'em.</hi> He hence concludes that 'tis in theſe Articles wherein conſiſts according to my way the diſtinct knowledg of the Myſtery of the Euchariſt. He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards obſerves that in another place ſpeaking of the trurh of the Euchariſt which have been always popular, I ſay, <hi>That the Myſtery of the Euchariſt has been always popular in the outward form of its celebration, and in the general acts which Chriſtians ought to perform in it. To take Bread, to drink Wine in remembrance of the Death and Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, to receive theſe things with a religious frame of mind as a great Sacrament which the Lord has ordained, to raiſe up ones Faith to the Body and Blood of our Saviour, to find therein the conſolation of our Souls; this without doubt is popular. It is popular to hearken to the teſtimony of ſenſe which tells us that 'tis Bread, and yet to hear that 'tis the Body of Chriſt, the Sacrament of the Body of Chriſt, its pledg, its memorial. It is popular to know that Jeſus Chriſt is in Heaven, and that from thence he ſhall come to judg both the quick and dead.</hi> Whence he concludes with Authority that the diſtinct knowledg which I give to the firſt Ages, and the confuſed one which I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the 10th, are but one and the ſame thing.</p>
                        <p>IT muſt be allowed that never any conſequence was more violently drawn than that of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s. Firſt, It is not true that the Articles which I give of the diſtinct knowledg, are the ſame with thoſe of the popular knowledg. Among the firſt is found, <hi>That the Bread and Wine loſe not their natural ſubſtance. That they are called the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe they are the Sacraments of 'em,</hi> which is not found in the Articles of the popular knowledg. How will he have this to be then one and the ſame thing. There is a great deal of difference between hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the teſtimony of ones proper ſenſes which ſhew the Euchariſt to be Bread and Wine, and learning from the inſtructions of Paſtors that the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt is Bread and Wine. The firſt induces a man to believe that to judg of it by ſenſe 'tis real Bread and Wine, but the ſecond goes farther; for it ſhews this very thing which the ſenſes depoſe, to be the true belief of the Church. Now theſe two things are wholly different as any man may ſee. The firſt does not diſpoſe men to reject Tranſubſtantiation as a novelty contrary to the Faith of the Church, for it remains ſtill to know whether the Faith of the Church be not contrary to the teſtimony of ſenſe. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond does diſpoſe 'em to it; for it ſhews that the Doctrin of the Church is according to the depoſition of the ſenſes. Now the firſt is according to my
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:41961:283"/> rule belonging to the popular knowledg; and the ſecond belongs to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct knowledg. What reaſon is there then in having theſe two know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges to be the ſame. Thirdly, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has not obſerved that when I ſpake of the diſtinct knowledg of the eight firſt Centuries, I did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend exactly to denote all the Articles of it, this was not my buſineſs in that place. But only t' obſerve ſome of the principal ones which were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make known the ſenſe of theſe Propoſitions, <hi>The Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, it is changed into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But it does not hence follow but that there were therein ſome others very conſiderable ones, which may be gathered from the paſſages of the Fathers, which I produc'd in my firſt part, as <hi>that the change which happens in the Euchariſt is not a change of Nature, but an addition of Grace to Nature; that Jeſus Chriſt, as to his human Body, or human Nature, is ſo in Heaven that he is no more on Earth; that the manducation of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is ſpiritual and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical; that we muſt not underſtand it literally, it being a figurative expreſſion; that the Sacrament and the verity repreſented by the Sacrament are two diſtinct things:</hi> and ſeveral others which are not neceſſary to be related. Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it were true that the Articles of the popular knowledg were the ſame with thoſe I mark'd of the diſtinct knowledg, which is evidently falſe, yet would it not follow that theſe two knowledges according to my ſenſe would be the ſame thing, ſeeing I never pretended to make an exact enumeration of all the points of the diſtinct knowledg, nor exclude them which I now denoted, which are no wiſe popular. In fine, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has not conſidered that of the ſame Articles, whether popular, or not popular, a man may have a diſtinct knowledg and a confuſed one, according as he makes a greater or leſſer reflection on them, according as they are reſpected with more or leſs application, according as each of thoſe that has the knowledg of 'em has more or leſs underſtanding, natural or acquired; ſo that ſuppoſing we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the diſtinct knowledg of the eight firſt Centuries only the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles which I ſpecifi'd, ſuppoſing theſe Articles were the ſame as thoſe I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the popular knowledg, which is not true; ſuppoſing again there were no difference in 'em, as there is in reſpect of ſome of theſe Articles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the knowing of 'em popularly, that is to ſay, either by the help of the Senſes, or by the natural motion of the Conſcience; and to know them by the inſtruction of the Paſtors, as a thing which the Church believes, and from which a man muſt not vary, it would in no wiſe thence follow that the confuſed knowledg were according to what I laid down, the ſame thing; the object of theſe two knowledges would be the ſame, but the knowledges would be diſtinct. And thus have we ſhewed Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s ſubtilties.</p>

                           <hi>uſually attended with very conſiderable defects.</hi> To which I have no more to ſay but this, that the pretenſions of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> are commonly very high, but generally very ill grounded; well offer'd, but ill defended.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>'TIS falſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that Paſchaſus did not teach his Doctrin, by expreſly condemning thoſe that were of a contrary Opinion.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> hides himſelf under a thin vail, pretending not to underſtand what he does very well. We do not ſay that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> did not propoſe his Doctrin by condemning thoſe of a contrary Opinion. This is not the point in queſtion. The queſtion is, Whether he did not propoſe his Doctrin as the Doctrin of the Church, which was not ſufficiently underſtood, and which he therefore more clearly explain'd? Now <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> himſelf decides this difference, as I have ſhewed in my Anſwer to the <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> For ſpeaking in the beginning of his Book touching his deſign, he ſays, <hi>That all the Faithful ought to underſtand the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. De Corpore &amp; Sang. Dom. cap. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>Sacrament of our Lords Body and Blood, which is every day celebrated in the Church, and what they ought to believe and know of it. That we muſt ſeek the virtue of it, and inſtruct our Faith under the Diſcipline of Jeſus Chriſt, leſt we be eſteem'd unworthy, if we do not diſcern it enough, not underſtanding what is the dignity, and the virtue of the myſtical Body and Blood of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</hi> And leſt it ſhould be imagin'd this was only a way of ſpeaking to excite the Faithful to inſtruct themſelves in this Myſtery (yet without ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that in effect they were ignorant of the expoſition he was going to make of it) we need only call to mind what he ſays in his Letter to <hi>Frude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,</hi> wherein ſpeaking of the ſucceſs his Book met with, <hi>I am informed,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that I have moved ſeveral to underſtand this myſtery,</hi> which ſhews, <note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Frud.</note> that according to him his Book was a more clear and expreſs expoſition of the Churches ſentiment, and that he had actually brought over ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from an obſcure, to a clear knowledg of this Myſtery. But without going any further, we need only read a paſſage of <hi>Odon</hi> Abbot of <hi>Clugny,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> himſelf has produc'd; for it expreſly juſtifies what I ſay, <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> ſays he, <hi>has wrote theſe things, and ſeveral others to learn us</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 9. ch. 6. page 913.</note> 
                           <hi>the reverence we owe to this myſtery, and make us know the majeſty of it: and if thoſe who pretend to be knowing would take the pains to read his Book, they will find ſuch great things in it, as will make 'em acknowledg they underſtood little of this myſtery before.</hi> After this teſtimony of one of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his principal Diſciples, who lived in the 10th. Century, I think it cannot be deny'd that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> propoſed his Doctrin by way of explication. He
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:41961:284"/> wrote, ſays he, to teach us what reverence we owe to this myſtery, and to make us know the majeſty of it. He will have alſo the learned before the reading of this Book to be in a manner ignorant of this myſtery, and ſeeing he is pleaſed the learned ſhould be no better qualified, I hope he will pardon the ignorant by a ſtronger reaſon.</p>
                        <p>AND thus do we ſee on what deſign <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> and his Diſciples taught their Opinion, to wit, as an illuſtration of the common Faith, an explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what was known before but obſcurely, and not as a Doctrin directly oppoſite to an Error with which men were imbued. I acknowledg that this deſign proved not ſucceſsful to 'em in reſpect of all, and there being ſeveral who regarded this opinion as a novelty which ought to be rejected; and as to them I doubt not but <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> and his Diſciples proceeded with 'em by way of oppoſition and contradiction, as we are wont to do againſt profeſt enemies: but how does this hinder them from propoſing their Doctrin by way of explication, and even this, to wit, whether it was an expoſition of the ancient Doctrin or not, was in part the ſubject of the contradiction.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>IT is not poſſible,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud, that a Doctrin ſhould be approv'd of</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 9. ch. 5. page 900.</note> 
                           <hi>immediately by all thoſe to whom it was propoſed. There muſt certainly be ſome who reject it, and warn others againſt it.</hi> I grant it, but that it hence follows as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would have it believed, that my pretenſion is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is what I deny, and that with reaſon; for a man may well propoſe a new opinion by way of an explication of the ancient Faith, and defend it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by way of contradiction againſt adverſaries who reject it, and reſpect it as a novelty.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>IN fine,</hi> adds Mr. <hi>Arnaud, this means will not ſerve the end for which</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>deſigns it, which is to hinder men from riſing up againſt this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, and make the change inſenſible to thoſe which ſuffered it.</hi> We never told Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> that this means abſolutely hindred the inſurrection he mentions, but in effect the contrary; to wit, that ſeveral did riſe up againſt <hi>Paſchaſus;</hi> but we pretend likewiſe 'twas eaſie to cheat ſeveral by making 'em receive this novelty, under the title of an explication, and that in their reſpect, they conceiv'd therein no other change than that which ignorant people do conceive, when they imagin a greater illuſtration of the Faith of the Church, and what thoſe learned perſons could conceive of it, mention'd by <hi>Odon,</hi> who by reading <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Book, acknowledg'd they had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto but ſmall knowledg of this myſtery. All the effect which this could produce was, to excite them againſt their former ignorance, and to eſteem themſelves obliged to <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> for his good inſtructions. Now we know that theſe kind of inſurrections make no great noiſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>BUT,</hi> ſays moreover Mr. <hi>Arnaud, others muſt be ſurpriz'd in a contrary</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Page 901.</note> 
                           <hi>manner, they muſt needs deride the abſurdity of this new Doctrin. They muſt be aſtoniſh'd at the boldneſs of</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>and his Diſciples propoſing of it as the Faith of the Church. They muſt be mightily offended at their being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of ignorance, and infidelity for not believing that which no Body ever did believe.</hi> Who told Mr. <hi>Aruaud</hi> there were not in effect ſeveral in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchaſus</hi> his time, who had theſe kind of ſentiments touching his Opinion. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaſus</hi> himſelf acknowledges that ſeveral called in queſtion his Doctrin, he ſays he was reprehended for taking our Saviour's words in a wrong ſenſe; he endeavours to anſwer ſome of their objections, ſeems to intimate he was
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:41961:285"/> accuſed for writing his Book by an Enthuſiaſtic raſhneſs and pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. And in effect <hi>John Scot, Raban,</hi> and <hi>Bertram</hi> wrote againſt his novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and oppoſed them. But this does not hinder its being true, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his Doctrin as an explication of the common Faith, and that this way might procure him many followers. And ſo far concerning the <hi>Machins of Mollification.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I come now to the pretended Machins of Execution. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately complains that I ſometimes make the Real Preſence to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by <hi>the noiſe</hi> of <hi>Diſputes,</hi> and otherwhiles acknowledg <hi>there was no Diſpute in the 10th. Century,</hi> wherein I pretend this was effected: <hi>I think,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 9. ch. 6. page 902.</note> ſays he, <hi>we had beſt leave him to his choice, and that by chooſing one of theſe chimerical means, he may acknowledg he has raſhly and falſly offer'd the other.</hi> Were Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s requeſt reaſonable, we would not ſtick to grant it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſharpneſs of his expreſſions. But 'tis unjuſt and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable: for 'tis certain that the change in queſtion has hapned, and that with and without Diſputes. There was a conteſt in the 9th. Century du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time wherein <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> lived, as I now ſaid. We do not find there was any in the 10th. but in the 11th 'twas very hot. So that any man may ſee there is no contradiction in what I offered, let Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſay what he pleaſes. Which I hope he will grant me, when he conſiders, Firſt, That what I ſaid concerning the ſenſes that were attackt by the noiſe of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and th' Authority of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> muſt be referred to the 11th, Century, and that 'twill not be found I attributed it to the 10th. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That when I ſpoke preciſely of the 10th. I did not ſuppoſe any Diſputes in it, but on the contrary a groſs ignorance, which hindred 'em from diſputing.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D</hi> cannot comprehend that there were, or that there were not any Diſputes. <hi>The means,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that they propoſed the Doctrin of the Real Preſence to ſo many perſons that never heard of it, or had an averſation to it, and that they have been perſuaded immediately, ſo that they made no reſiſtance.</hi> And ſo far for the Diſputes. <hi>The means likewiſe that ſo many Diſputes ſhould produce no Writings, that the Paſchaſits ſhould pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh nothing to ſatisfie the doubts propoſed to 'em. That the Bertramits in rejecting the Doctrin of the Real Preſence ſhould never publiſh the reaſons for it.</hi> And here we have ſomething againſt the Diſputes.</p>
                        <p>BUT people muſt never argue againſt matters of fact. 'Tis certain there were Diſputes againſt <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Doctrin in the 9th. Century, we learn as much from <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> himſelf; 'tis alſo certain there were likewiſe in the 11th. on the ſame ſubject. We are informed of this by the Hiſtory of <hi>Berenger.</hi> It appears that the Doctrin of <hi>Bertram</hi> had likewiſe its courſe in the 10th. We learn this from the Paſchal Homilies and Sermons of that time which are extant. 'Tis alſo certain the Real Preſence was taught therein. We know this by th' example of <hi>Odon</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> who made uſe of Miracles to perſuade the world of the truth of it. Yet does it not appear there were any Diſputes rais'd on this point, nor Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings on either ſide. It ſeems to me we ought to ſtop here, and argue not againſt theſe matters of fact, ſeeing they cannot be denied, but on theſe facts to draw notices thence which may clear our principal Queſtion, which is whether <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> was the Innovator, or whether th' innovation muſt be attributed to <hi>John Scot,</hi> to <hi>Bertram,</hi> to <hi>Raban,</hi> or any other adverſaries of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Doctrin.</p>

                        <p>THIS is the Point to be diſpatched, for what ſignifies the marking one by one of the Authors that have written the lives of the Saints of the 10th. Century. What matter is it to us who wrote the life of S. <hi>Radbodus,</hi> or that of S. <hi>Godart,</hi> or S. <hi>Remacle? We do not ſee,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud, in any of theſe</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 9. ch. 6. page 907.</note> 
                           <hi>lives that either of 'em buſied himſelf to inſtruct the people in the Doctrin of the Real Preſence, and to refute the contrary opinion.</hi> Were this obſervation true what good would redound from it? Did theſe Hiſtorians deſign to learn the world the ſentiments of their Saints on every particular Article of Religion, or to inform us what was the ſubject of their Sermons and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions which they gave their people? Moreover, who ſuppoſes all theſe Biſhops were Preachers of the Real Preſence? It is ſufficient there were ſome that have authoris'd this Doctrin, <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> himſelf acknowledges, relates of <hi>Odon</hi> th' Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury, That he confirm'd ſeveral in the Faith that doubted of the truth of our Lords</hi>

                           <hi>Body, having ſhewed them by a miracle, the Bread of the Altar changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Fleſh, and the Wine of the Chalice changed into Blood.</hi> Whether theſe doubters were the Diſciples of <hi>John Scot,</hi> or not, 'tis not neceſſary to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; 'tis ſufficient that this relation ſhews us there were ſeveral perſons that withſtood the Doctrin of the Real Preſence, and that theſe perſons were neither inconſiderable for their number, nor fame; ſeeing a Primate of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> th' Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was forced to make uſe of a Miracle for their Converſion. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> likewiſe tells us from the Life of S. <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtan</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Page 9 8.</note> that he preached the Real Preſence; and we have ſeen already what he himſelf alledges touching <hi>Oden</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Clugny,</hi> who exhorted thoſe that thought themſelves learned to read <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Book, telling 'em they might learn ſuch great things in it, as would make 'em acknowledg they had hitherto but ſmall knowledg of the myſtery of the Euchariſt. This methinks is ſufficient to ſhew there were endeavours in the 10th. Century to eſtabliſh the Real Preſence. For what could theſe great things be which the Learned had no knowledg of, and in which they were to be inſtructed by <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Book, but the myſteries of the Real Preſence? 'Twould be abſurd to ſay, that by theſe great things we muſt underſtand only the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Piety with which we ought to receive the Sacrament. For 'tis to be ſuppoſed, theſe Learned folks, mention'd by <hi>Odon</hi> were not ignorant that Jeſus Chriſt is on the Altar by the proper ſubſtance of his Body, neither could be ignorant that it ought to be received with all the Reſpect and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we are able; and therefore there was no need to ſend 'em to <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Book to diſcover therein this conſequence, ſeeing it diſcovers it ſelf ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently enough by the bare idea which the Goſpel gives us of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>MOREOVER, he that deſires to ſee the ſtrange effects of prejudice, need but read the 7th. Chapter of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s 9th. Book. He pretends to ſhew therein, as the title of the Chapter bears, <hi>That the mixture of the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Page 914.</note> 
                           <hi>two Doctrines which Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>is obliged to admit in the 10th. Century, is a thing the moſt contrary imaginable to common ſenſe.</hi> He exerts all his parts, to ſhew this mixture is impoſſible, he cannot endure there ſhould be therein ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant or prophane perſons, nor <hi>Paſchaſiſts,</hi> nor <hi>Bertramiſts,</hi> and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues thereupon till he has loſt both himſelf and his Readers.</p>
                        <p>YET is this a real matter of fact againſt which all Mr, <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will not prevail, That the two Doctrines have been mixt in this Century. I already proved it in my Anſwer to the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> but Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has thought good to ſuppreſs my proofs, and paſs 'em over in ſilence, to make
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:41961:286"/> way for his reaſonings. But let him argue as long as he will, he cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its being true, that in the 10th. Century th'Engliſh were taught this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, <hi>that as we conſider two things in the ſame creature, as for inſtance in the</hi>

                           <hi>water of Baptiſm, the one that it is naturally true 'tis corruptible Water; and th'other that according to the ſpiritual myſtery, it has a ſaving virtue; ſo likewiſe if we conſider th' Euchariſt according to our natural underſtanding, we ſee it to be a corporeal and elementary creature; but if we regard the ſpiritual virtue, then we underſtand there is life in it, and that 'twill give immortality to thoſe that ſhall partake of it with Faith. That there is a great deal of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the inviſible virtue of this holy Euchariſt, and the viſible ſpecies of nature; that in reſpect of its nature it is corruptible Bread, and corruptible Wine, and that by the virtue of the Divine Word it is truly the Body and Blood of Chriſt, yet not corporeally, but ſpiritually. That there is a great deal of difference between this Body in which Jeſus Chriſt has ſuffered, and that Body which is Conſecrated in the Euchariſt: For the Body with which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour has ſuffered was born of the Virgin, has Blood, Bones, Skin, Sinews, and is indued with a reaſonable Soul. But his ſpiritual Body which we call the Euchariſt is compoſed of ſeveral grains, without Blood, Bones, Members, and Soul; and therefore we muſt not underſtand any thing of it corporeally, but ſpiritually.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>II. Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D</hi> cannot hinder it from being true, that the <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> people were inſtructed in this manner. <hi>The heavenly food with which the Jews were nouriſhed by the ſpace of forty years, and the Water which ran from the Rock, repreſented the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, which we now every day offer in the Church. They were the ſame things which we offer at this day, not corporeally, but ſpiritually. We have already told you that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt before his Paſſion Conſecrated Bread and Wine to be his Euchariſt, and ſaid, This is my Body and Blood. He had not yet ſuffered, and yet he changed by his inviſible virtue this Bread into his own Body, and this Wine into his own Blood, in the ſame manner as he had already done in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before he was incarnate, when he changed the heavenly Manna into his Fleſh, and the Water which ran from the Rock into his own Blood. He that eats my Fleſh and drinks my Blood has Eternal Life. He does not command us to eat that Body which he aſſum'd, nor drink that Blood which he ſpilt for us, but by this he means the holy Euchariſt, which is ſpiritually his Body and Blood, which whoſoever ſhall taſte with a pure heart ſhall live eternally. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ancient Law the Faithful offered to God ſeveral Sacrifices, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified the Body of Jeſus Chriſt to come; this Body I ſay which he offered to God his Father as a Sacrifice for our Sins. But this Euchariſt which we now Conſecrate on Gods Altar is the Commemoration of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for us, and Blood ſhed for us, according as he himſelf has commanded, ſaying, Do this in remembrance of me.</hi>

                           <hi>truly his Blood, does himſelf every day Conſecrate by the hands of the Prieſt the Bread into his Body, and the Wine into his Blood, by a ſpiritual myſtery, as we find it written. This enlivening Bread is not in any ſort the ſame Body in which our Lord ſuffered, and the Conſecrated Wine is not the Blood of our Lord, which was ſhed as to the corporeal matter, but it is as to the ſpiritual. The Bread was his Body, and the Wine his Blood, as the Bread of Heaven which we call the Manna with which the people of God were nouriſhed during forty years, and the water which ran from the Rock in the Deſart was his Blood, as ſays the Apoſtle in one of his Epiſtles, they ate of the ſame ſpiritual food, and drank of the ſame ſpiritual drink. The Apoſtle does not ſay corporally but ſpiritually. For Jeſus Chriſt was not then born, nor his Blood ſpilt, when the people ate of this food, and drank of this Rock.</hi>

                        <p>IV. Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D</hi> cannot hinder <hi>Wulſtin</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> in <note place="margin">Mss. in Colleg. S. Bened. Cant.</note> his Sermon which he made to his Clergy, from ſpeaking in this manner; <hi>This Sacrifice is not the Body of Jeſus Chriſt wherein he ſuffered, nor his Blood which was ſhed for us; but it is made ſpiritually his Body and Blood, as the Manna which fell from Heaven, and the water which guſhed out of the Rock, according to the ſaying of S.</hi> Paul, <hi>I will not have you Brethren to be ignorant, that our Fathers have been all under a Cloud, and paſs'd the Sea, and all of 'em baptiz'd by</hi> Moſes, <hi>in the Cloud and in the Sea, and that they have all eaten the ſame ſpiritual food, and drank the ſame ſpiritual drink; for they drank out of the ſpiritual Rock which followed them. Now this Rock was Chriſt: and therefore the Pſalmiſt ſays, he gave them the Bread of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Man has eaten the Angels food. We likewiſe without doubt eat the Bread of Angels, and drink of this Rock which ſignifies Chriſt, every time we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach with Faith to the Sacrifice of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                        <p>V. Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D</hi> muſt know that the people were publickly <note place="margin">In eod. Mss. Eccl.

                        <p>VIII. Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D</hi> himſelf confeſſes that <hi>John Scot,</hi> who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew <note place="margin">Book 9. ch. 6. p. 909.</note> into <hi>England</hi> about the end of the preceding Century, made perhaps ſome Diſciples of his Doctrin. 'Tis true he would have theſe Diſciples to be <hi>ſecret.</hi> But why <hi>ſecret? John Scot</hi> kept not himſelf private, <hi>Bertran</hi> and <hi>Raban</hi> were neither of 'em in private, Thoſe that diſliked <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Novelties hid not themſelves in the 9th. Century. Why then muſt the Diſciples of <hi>John Scot</hi> lie ſecret in the 10th. wherein were Homilies that were filled with Doctrins contrary to that of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> publickly read? Beſides, as I have already ſaid, there's no likelihood that <hi>Odon</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> ſhould think himſelf oblig'd to have recourſe to ſuch a famous
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:41961:287"/> miracle as is that related by <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> to confute thoſe that durſt not ſhew themſelves.</p>
                        <p>SEEING therefore on one hand the Doctrin of the Real Preſence taught in the 10th. Century, and on the other the contrary Doctrin prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and publickly held, it ſeems to me we may ſay with boldneſs that this Century was mix'd; and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> cannot give us a greater prejudice againſt his way of arguing by pretended moral impoſſibilities than to uſe them in a caſe wherein the matter of fact ſo plainly appears.</p>
                        <p>'TIS moreover very ſtrange that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſhould endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade us 'twas not poſſible there could be in this Century ignorant people that had no other than a confuſed knowledg of Goſpel Myſteries; after the teſtimonies we have brought him of ſo many Authors who unanimouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the contrary. Does he expect we will believe him ſooner than <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> of <hi>Tyr</hi> an Hiſtorian of the 12th.

We leave off Preaching, we behold thoſe committed to us forſake God, and plunge themſelves in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of lewdneſs, and yet are ſilent; we reach not forth to 'em the hand of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.

There being no body to ſhew 'em the way of life, how can it be but they muſt wander into the paths of error? Thus in them is accompliſhed what is ſaid by the Prophet, This ignorant people ſhall be ſtruck with jealouſie; and again, My people are gone into captivity, becauſe they had no knowledg. Where are they who are converted by our Preaching and have brought forth fruits worthy of repentance?

                        <p>This good Biſhop who deſerves without doubt for his zeal not to be <note place="margin">Concilium Troſl. cap. 3.</note> comprehended amongſt the number of others, deſcribing in a decretal of his Council aſſembled at <hi>Troſly</hi> the condition of the Monaſteries of his time, ſays, <hi>That as well the Monks as the Nuns lived without Rule, and Diſcipline, applying themſelves to worldly affairs; that ſome of 'em were conſtrained by neceſſity to return into the world again, that the Monaſteries were poſſeſs'd by Lay-Abbots who lived therein with their Wives, Children, Soldiers and Dogs; that the Abbots were not in a capacity t'examine the Rules of their Convents, to read, or underſtand 'em; and if at any time the Book was offered 'em, their reply was,</hi> Neſcio literas. He afterwards repreſents the violence of thoſe
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:41961:287"/> that raviſh'd the goods of the Church, perſecuted, and put to death the Prieſts, forcibly took away their Neighbors Eſtates, laying ſnares for the innocent, putting 'em to death and plundering their houſes, and ſays the number of theſe latter was infinite, and that they imagin'd 'twas a gentile thing to live by Rapine. Afterwards he turns his diſcourſe to the Raviſhers of Virgins, and Women, and thoſe that contracted clandeſtine and inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Marriages, and ſhews the number of theſe was not ſmall. Thence he comes to the ſcandalous converſation of Prieſts with Women, to perjured Perſons, Quarrels, Murthers; and in fine, concludes by an exhortation to the Biſhops his Suffragans to do henceforward their duty. <hi>Alas,</hi> ſays he, <note place="margin">Ibid. in Epil.</note> 
                           <hi>alas! thro our negligence, and ignorance, and by the neglect and ignorance of our Predeceſſors, and that of our Brethren who are ſtill living, ſeveral do pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in their Vices, and at this time there are an infinite number of people of both Sexes, Ages, and Conditions, ignorant of the Faith, know not their Creed, or Pater noſter. How can theſe people, ſuppoſing they were of honeſt converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do good Works, having not the foundation of Faith? And what excuſe can we make for our ſelves? when they die they enter not into life, for they are unacquainted with it, but they enter into eternal death, which they cannot avoid, being without Faith; for the juſt live by Faith. We are then, as</hi> Gregory <hi>ſays, the murtherers of theſe people that periſh, whereas we ſhould be their guides to ſave them. For 'tis for our ſins this multitude are degenerated, becauſe we careleſly neglect the giving them the inſtructions of life.</hi> Will Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> now perſuade us 'twas impoſſible there ſhould be perſons in the 10th.

                           <hi>a million of Preachers of the Real Preſence, and a million of people that reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted it.</hi> When Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is in his Cloſet, a million of Preachers coſts him no more than thirty; and his Commiſſion is as ſoon given to a great number as a ſmall. But what is moſt admirable, is, that when we come to count theſe Preachers of the Real Preſence, we do not find 'em to be above four or five at moſt; one of which, as I already obſerved, plainly tells us, that thoſe of his time that perſonated learned men had ſmall knowledg of this myſtery, till they read <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Book, which muſt be according to him the fountain of their light. 'Tis moreover to be obſerved that what I now alledged of <hi>Hérivé</hi> in the Council of <hi>Troſly,</hi> is of the year 909 that is to ſay, in the beginning of the 10th. Century. Now it is certain the darkneſs waxed greater after this Century, but we ſee to what degree it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived then. Moſt of the Abbats knew not how to read. The Paſtors left off Preaching to and inſtructing of the people; and an infinite number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of either Sex, both young and old, could not ſay their Creed, nor the Lords Prayer during their whole lives. Methinks it cannot be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded hence there were at that time in the Church neither ignorant nor prophane perſons; much leſs can it be concluded hence, there were then but three ſorts of perſons, the <hi>Paſchaſiſts,</hi> the <hi>Bertramiſts,</hi> and thoſe that paſs'd from one opinion to another. <hi>'Tis ſufficient,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud, to tell</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Page 916.</note> 
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>in a word, that to act as he muſt ſuppoſe they have done, they muſt not have been men, but ſome other kind of Animals, and ſuch creatures as we never heard of.</hi> To which I anſwer, that if he will not allow 'em to be Men, he ſhall make Satyrs, or Centaurs of 'em if he will: for as to my part I muſt ſuppoſe 'em to be what they are. If he does not find the <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſiſts</hi> had zeal enough for the Real Preſence, he ought to impart more to 'em if he can. And if the <hi>Bertramiſts</hi> have not well diſcharged their duty,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:41961:288"/> we for our ſhare muſt deplore their ſtupidity, ſeeing we cannot help it. But howſoever 'tis certain there were <hi>Paſchaſiſts,</hi> and that there were <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramiſts;</hi> and 'tis likewiſe as certain that the Paſtors careleſſneſs, and the People ignorance were both very great. Theſe are matters of fact, againſt which 'tis in vain to diſpute. All that can be rationally ſaid, is, that the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the one, and the careleſſneſs of the others made 'em agree in the ſubject of the Real Preſence. I mean they diſputed not about it, becauſe they wanted ability to do it, as well as zeal and induſtry.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D</hi> endeavours in vain to perſuade us that the diſorders <note place="margin">Book 9. ch. 9. page 957.</note> of the 10th. Century were no greater than thoſe of the others, and <hi>that the ſtate of the Church in this world is to include in the ſame external Society both living and dead Members, Stubble and Wheat; 'tis a neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this ſtate, that a man may reproach every Age with ſeveral diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and that each time of the Church may be reſpected as having two different faces, according as a man caſts his eyes upon the good that credit it, or the wicked that diſhonour it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>WHAT he ſays is but too true, and ſo 'tis too true that the 10th. Century has improved the former errors; for beſides that the common diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders have appeared in it in a different degree, there were particular ones in it which the preceding Ages were not acquainted with. Never was there ſuch an ignorance before which the Council of <hi>Troſly</hi> then denoted. The neglect of the Biſhops and Prieſts was never ſo great as that Council, <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fric</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Tyre</hi> deſcribe it. Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs never reigned ſo much amongſt the Monks and Prieſts, as <hi>Polydor Virgil</hi> teſtifies it did then. Such an univerſal degeneracy, as we find attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted by Authors to thoſe times, we never yet heard of. There were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the like diſorders as thoſe that were obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable throughout this whole Century. Such a relaxation of Diſcipline in the Cathedral Churches (the ſuperintendency of which was committed to Children of 5, 10, 12, and 14 years) was never before known. Moſt Writers that have mention'd it are Hiſtorians that deſign'd not to paſs cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, or aggravate in general the degeneracy of men, but to remark the particular characters of this Century which diſtinguiſh them from the reſt. And therefore they call it <hi>the unhappy Age, an Age of lead, the iron Age, an obſcure and dark Age, an Age of darkneſs and ignorance, a moſt wretched time wherein the juſt were not to be found, and wherein truth had for ſaken the earth, an Age,</hi> in ſhort, <hi>wherein hapned a general decay of all virtues.</hi>

                        <p>'TIS in vain for Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to ſay again, <hi>'twas an Age of Zeal, Fervour,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 9. ch. 7. page 947.</note> 
                           <hi>Converſions, Reformations in Princes, in Princeſſes, in Biſhops, in Religious Perſons, and in the People.</hi> For firſt, 'tis certain that in reſpect of thoſe which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſpeaks of, that their Zeal, their Fervour, their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, their Reformations, ſuch as they were had not that prevalency as to make 'em diſpute amongſt themſelves of the Real Preſence. On one hand was taught, as we have already obſerved, <hi>That there's a great difference between this Body in which Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered, and that which is Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Euchariſt; that the one is born of the Virgin, has Blood, Bones, Skin, Nerves, and is endued with a reaſonable Soul; but that the other which is his ſpiritual Body conſiſts of ſeveral grains, without Blood, Bones, Members, and Soul. That as in the Water of Baptiſm there are two things to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, one that according to nature 'tis corruptible water, and the other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording</hi>
                           <pb n="181" facs="tcp:41961:288"/> 
                           <hi>to the ſpiritual myſtery, this water has a ſalutary virtue; ſo the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt according to the natural underſtanding is a corporeal and corruptive creature, and according to the ſpiritual virtue, life is in it, it gives immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to the Faithful.</hi> 'Twas taught, that the <hi>Bread and Wine are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally changed into the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, as the Manna was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into his Fleſh, and the water of the Rock into his Blood. That the Bread is not in any wiſe the ſame Body in which our Saviour ſuffered, nor the Wine the Blood which he ſhed for us, but his Body and Blood ſpiritually.</hi> In this Age were ſeveral paſſages of the Fathers collected and urged againſt <hi>Paſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> touching the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. On the other hand the Paſtors were exhorted to come and learn in <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Book what they were as yet ignorant of. Miracles were likewiſe wrought to confirm thoſe that doubted of the Real Preſence; but we do not find they diſputed about it one againſt another. If the reaſon which I offer from the ignorance, and negligence of the one and the other does not well reliſh with Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> let him give a better, I'll gladly receive it, provided he denies not certain matters of fact, againſt which no arguments muſt be offered.</p>
                        <p>THE Zeal, Fervour, Converſions and Reformations which he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to the 10th. Century, hinder not the truth of what we obſerved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Religious living without Rule, their Abbots being married and Lay-men, the Biſhops neglecting to inſtruct their Flocks, and an infinite number of either Sex and all Ages, being ignorant of the Creed and Lords Prayer, and living and dying in this ignorance. This is a matter of fact atteſted by Witneſſes of that very Age. This does not hinder but the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church was for this whole Century in a <hi>fearful diſorder,</hi> as ſpeaks the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> too when he tells us, <hi>Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>

He ſlept and made as tho he ſaw not theſe things, he let them alone, he aroſe not to take vengeance; and that which was worſe, there were no Diſciples who by their ſhrieks ſhould awake the Lord ſleeping, for they were all aſleep themſelves.

                        <p>THE Zeal, Fervour, frequent Converſions, and Reformations of thoſe days could not hinder but that Symony was very frequent, as I proved in my Anſwer to the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> by the teſtimonies of <hi>Luitprand,</hi> and <hi>Glaber,</hi>

And moreover, the Arch-biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, and Biſhopricks commonly beſtowed on Children uncapable of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging thoſe great truſts; which <hi>Baronius</hi> expreſly aſſerts: for having told <note place="margin">Baron. ad ann. 925.</note> us from the teſtimony of <hi>Frodoart</hi> that <hi>Heribert</hi> Earl of <hi>Guyenne</hi> and <hi>Süel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Rhemes</hi> were agreed, that after the death of <hi>Süelphus</hi> the Arch-biſhoprick ſhould come to <hi>Heribert</hi>'s Son, he ſays, that <hi>Heribert</hi> to make quick work cauſed <hi>Süelphus</hi> to be poiſoned, and his Son to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen in his place, who was not above five years old; that the news of the Election being brought to the King, he confirm'd it, which was alſo done by Pope <hi>John</hi> the Xth.

                        <p>WHEREUNTO we may add the Tumults and continual Wars with which the Weſt was afflicted during this whole Century; for 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that from the beginning to the end of it all Europe reſounded with the noiſe of them. <hi>France</hi> was therein troubled by the League of <hi>Robert,</hi> and the dreadful conſequences hapning thereupon, by the Wars againſt the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Danes, and Germans, and by thoſe which hapned upon the rejection of <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and th' Election of <hi>Hugo Capet. England</hi> was therein diſturb'd by divers Civil Wars, and the frequent Incurſions of the Danes, Scotch, Iriſh, and other people ſtill profeſſing Paganiſm. <hi>Spain</hi> was alſo moleſted by the Moors, Arabians, and Saracens, by the Invaſions of the Normans, and by the dreadful Diviſions of the Chriſtians.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>GERMANY</hi> ſpent this Century in perpetual Confuſions, the Danes, Sclavonians, and Huns ravag'd all things by their irruptions which often hapned. For Children to contrive the death of their Parents was ordinary, and Great Perſons to riſe up againſt their lawful Princes, (which commonly ended in bloody Battels) not to mention the cruel Wars which the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors had to maintain in <hi>Italy</hi> againſt the Factious, and in <hi>Calabria</hi> againſt the Greeks and Saracens.) As to <hi>Italy</hi> ſhe was throughout this whole Century, in the moſt deplorable ſtate imaginable; on one hand by the Princes of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> on the other by the Wars of the Italian Princes one againſt another, and the Arms of the Emperors and neighboring Kings. In ſhort, the confuſions were then ſo general, that there was ſcarcely a corner in Europe wherein a man that loves quiet could obtain it.

                        <p>I CONFESS there were in this Age ſome endeavours after a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; bu beſides that they were but mere eſſays that proved ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, I deny they were ſtrong enough, ſuppoſing they could have had a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for ſucceſs, to ſtir men up to ſearch into the Controverſie of Chriſts Real Preſence in the Sacrament.

                        <p>HERE we have without queſtion very commendable endeavours, but they reach no farther than the inſtructing of the people in the Articles of the Creed and the principal points of morality. Theſe Fathers in their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt zeal to reform both themſelves and others, make no mention of the Real Preſence. 'Twas not then above fifty years when the Diſpute was very hot on this ſubject, and Books were wrote on both ſides. Yet it ſeems they took no notice of it, much leſs determin to inſtruct the people in what they ought to hold of it. All their care was to remove that ignorance of the Fundamentals wherein the people lay, and correct that fearful corruption of manners wherein the greateſt parr ſpent their lives. Now this ſhews us that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> can draw no advantage from theſe eſſays of a Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for ſuppoſing they had their whole effect, they extended not ſo far as the queſtion of the Real Preſence, becauſe they ſuppoſe either that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were not ignorant of it, or that the Paſtors were themſelves ſo perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of it, that twas needleſs to inſtruct them in it, or exhort them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their Flocks in it. But what likelihood is there that this in numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able multitude of people of both Sexes, and of all Ages and conditions of life, that knew not their Creed, nor the Lords Prayer, and lived without any knowledg of the Principles of Chriſtian Religion ſhould know the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the Real Preſence. Were they all in thoſe days born imbued with this Doctrin? What likelihood is there thoſe Abbots that knew not the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of their Monaſteries, and who to excuſe themſelves from reading 'em when offered to them, were forced to ſay, <hi>neſcimus literas,</hi> were not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe greatly ignorant of the Myſtery of the Euchariſt? What reaſon is there to ſay the Paſtors themſelves were commonly inſtructed in it, ſeeing <hi>Odon.</hi> Abbot of <hi>Clugny,</hi> as we have already ſeen, teſtifies that thoſe who
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:41961:290"/> pretended to be learned yet had little knowledg of the Sacrament till they read <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Book.</p>
                        <p>THERE were likewiſe other Reformations made in this Century, but they ſerved only to eſtabliſh ſome order in the Monaſteries, and the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of particular Statutes under which the Religious are obliged to live by their profeſſion; and this does not hinder but that ignorance and careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were very great in reſpect of the Myſtery of Religion.</p>
                        <p>AS to the Converſions, 'tis certain there were ſome, but Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> knows very well the greateſt part of 'em were wrought by force, or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts and intrigues of Princes. And thus thoſe that were converted might well embrace their Religion implicitly or in groſs, without troubling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with particular Doctrins, as the greateſt part of the People of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church do at preſent. In the year 912, according to <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter, Rollon,</hi> or <hi>Raoul,</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> embraced the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to eſpouſe <hi>Gill</hi> the Daughter or Siſter of <hi>Charles</hi> III. King of <hi>France.</hi> In the year 925, <hi>Sitricus</hi> King of <hi>Denmark</hi> cauſed himſelf to be Baptiſed to eſpouſe <hi>Edgite</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Etelſtan</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> but a while after he returned to Paganiſm. In the year 926, <hi>Elſtan</hi> having vanquiſh'd in Battle ſeveral petty Kings which were then in <hi>England,</hi> obliged them and their Subjects to receive the Chriſtian Faith. In the year 949, <hi>Otton</hi> King of <hi>Germany</hi> having ſubdued the Sclavonians, theſe people redeemed their lives and Country by being Baptiz'd. In the year 965, <hi>Poland</hi> was converted to the Chriſtian Faith by the Marriage of <hi>Mieziſlaus</hi> its King with the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Boleſlaüs</hi> Duke of <hi>Bohemia. John</hi> XIII. Anti-Pope to <hi>Benedict</hi> V. ſent thither <hi>Gilles</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Tuſculum</hi> to eſtabliſh under the Authority of the King his Religion in that Country. In the year 989, <hi>Adalbert</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Prague</hi> went into <hi>Hungary</hi> to endeavour the converſion of thoſe people; but this was under the authority and power of <hi>Geiſa</hi> King of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> who was converted by commerce with Chriſtians whom he freely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to live in his Kingdom. So that all theſe converſions about which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> and the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> make ſuch a noiſe to advance the glory, zeal, and knowledg of the Biſhops of the 10th. Century do not at all conclude what they pretend.</p>
                        <p>LET the Reader then joyn all theſe things together, and judg which of us two has moſt reaſon, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> who maintains it to be impoſſible that the belief of the Real Preſence, ſuppoſing 'twere a novelty in the Church, could make any progreſs therein in the 10th. Century without Diſputes and Commotions, or I who maintain that theſe progreſſes were not only poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but eaſie to be conceiv'd, Firſt, There were Diſputes on this ſubject in the 9th. Century, which is a matter of fact not to be denied. Secondly, Altho the queſtion was therein agitated, yet was it not decided by any Council, nor by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor by any other publick Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Thirdly, Thoſe of the 10th. Century fell into a very confuſed know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Myſtery of Chriſtian Religion, in general, the People, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, and the greateſt part of the Prieſts and Biſhops, lived in very groſs ignorance, and in a prodigious neglect of the chief Offices of their Charge, as we have fully proved. Fourthly, Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline was wholly laid aſide in this Age, and the temporal ſtate of the Church lay in a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and general confuſion. Fifthly, It appears that the Doctrin of <hi>Bertram</hi> which was contrary to the Real Preſence was therein preached in ſeveral
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:41961:290"/> places. Sixthly, It alſo appears that that of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> was ſo too, and was endeavour'd to be under-propt by Miracles, and Paſtors exhorted to read <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Book to be inſtructed in the Myſtery of the Euchariſt. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly, To which we may add, that the perſons that taught the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in this Century were people of great credit and authority. <hi>Odon</hi> that confirm'd it by Miracles was Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and was in great reputation. Th'other <hi>Odon</hi> who had ſuch an eſteem for <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Book was an Abbot of <hi>Clugny,</hi> a reſtorer and reformer of ſeveral Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, of whom <hi>Baronius</hi> ſays, <hi>That he was choſen by God as another</hi> Jeremiah <note place="margin">Baron. ad an. 938.</note>

                        </p>
                        <p>ALL theſe matters of fact being clearly proved as they are, what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility is there that the Doctrin of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> (which he taught in the 9th. Century, as an explication of the true Doctrin of the Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming it as much as he could by ſeveral paſſages of the Fathers taken in a wrong ſenſe, no publick Authority having condemn'd it) ſhould have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers in the 10th. That theſe his Diſciples finding 'emſelves credited and authoris'd by their Offices and Employs in a Church wherein ignorance, careleſneſs, and confuſion reign'd, have themſelves communicated and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd it in the minds of ſeveral, without reſiſtance; and thus this Doctrin has made in the ſpace of theſe hundred years inſenſible progreſſes, eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf by little and little under the name and title of the Churches Faith, till having been at length directly and formally contradicted in the 11th. as an innovation, this Doctrin found it ſelf the ſtrongeſt, and triumph'd over the contrary Doctrin. What difficulty can be rais'd againſt this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, which may not be caſily ſolved? If it be ſaid that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> did not propoſe any thing but what all the faithful already diſtinctly knew and believed, <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> himſelf will anſwer for me, that he has moved ſeveral perſons to the underſtanding of this Myſtery, which ſuppoſes that before his time 'twas not ſufficiently known, and that he diſcovered things of which the people were ignorant. <hi>Odon</hi> will anſwer for me that the moſt learned had but little knowledg of the myſtery of the Euchariſt if they had not read <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Book. If it be ſaid his Doctrin met with no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> himſelf will tell you that ſome blamed him for attributing more to the word of Chriſt than the truth it ſelf has promiſed us, and 'tis hereon he diſputes againſt his Adverſaries. Should a man deny that the two Doctrins, that of <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> and that of his Adverſaries were both taught in the 10th. Century, he will (I think) be convinced of the contrary by the proofs I have given; and in effect there's no great likelihood that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of <hi>John Scot,</hi> and <hi>Bertram,</hi> who wrote by the command of King <hi>Charles the Bald</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and that of <hi>Raban,</hi> three perſons of great note in the Church, ſhould be thus extinct in ſo ſhort a time, without any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils condemning it, without the Court of <hi>Romes</hi> concerning her ſelf with it, without the interpoſition of temporal Princes, and that there ſhould, I ſay, remain no trace of it in the 10th. Century. He that ſhall think it ſtrange that the people of the 10th. Century have taken for the Faith of the Church that which was in effect an innovation, need only call to mind the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance wherein the people lived; for when a man does not know what the Church believes, 'tis no hard matter for him to be deceived, and to take that which ſhe does not believe for what ſhe does. That man that queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons this ignorance need only for his conviction to read the proofs I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of it. Should any man alledg it to be ſtrange ſuch men as an Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and an Abbot of <hi>Clugny</hi> ſhould be deceived, 'tis eaſie
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:41961:291"/> to ſhew the weakneſs of this objection by th' example of ſeveral that are men of better parts than thoſe now in queſtion, who now take for the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the Church what is not ſo. The Diſciples of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> found in his Book ſuch ſpecious Arguments as deceiv'd 'em, and 'tis a thing ordinary enough to be ſurprized by falſe colours. Should it be ſaid to be impoſſible but that the Diſciples of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> (knowing <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Doctrin was taught in ſeveral places) have openly condemned it and diſputed againſt thoſe that held it. Firſt, I anſwer, I do not know whether we may abſolutely ſay there was no diſpute about it, for there may be diſputes and we not know of 'em; but ſuppoſing there were not? I anſwer, that ſeeing 'tis no Miracle that diſputation ſhould ceaſe ſometimes in an enlightned Age, amongſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and zealous men, without any Converſions on either ſide, 'tis much leſs one in a dark and troubleſom Age wherein perſons thought of nothing leſs than diſputing. The Diſciples of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> thought they were oblig'd to be contented in recommending the reading of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Book to all perſons, and in confirming their Opinion by Miracles. If it be likewiſe ſaid that thoſe that followed the Doctrin of <hi>Bertram</hi> ought to diſpute againſt thoſe that follow'd that of <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> I muſt ſay ſo too, but that men do not do always what they are obliged to do, becauſe they have not always that zeal, knowledg, or induſtry which they ought to have. How ſhould they diſpute one againſt another, who left for the moſt part their Flocks without Paſture, without Inſtruction, without Preaching. Howſoever, this is as I ſaid a thing certain, that there were perſons in this Century, who held the Doctrin of <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> and others that of <hi>Bertram.</hi> Whether they diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or no, it concerns me not to know; 'tis ſufficient for me that this Age held both theſe Doctrins, which I think cannot be denied. When two op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Doctrins are taught, and both as the true Faith of the Church in an Age of Ignorance, to ſpeak after the manner of men, and according to the terms of our Diſpute, 'tis equally impoſſible either of them ſhould get the upper hand; becauſe they want that underſtanding which is requiſite to to make aright judgment: and moreover, if the one be aſſerted by perſons of Authority and great Reputation, it is almoſt impoſſible but this will carry it away from the other. Whence it follows the progreſs of the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in the 10th. Century has been not only poſſible, but eaſie, and even unavoidable. To which, if we add another matter of fact, which is that we do not find there were Diſputes in this Century on this ſubject; whence we will conclude that theſe progreſſes we ſpeak of have been made in an inſenſible manner, at leaſt in our reſpect, which is to ſay, that if there were any noiſe or conteſts, the knowledg of 'em never came to us, which ſuffices to decide the queſtion between us two.</p>
                        <p>AND this is what I had to ſay touching the ſtate of the 10th. Century in reſpect of Tranſubſtantiation and the Real Preſence. I take no notice of thoſe violent accuſations which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> brings againſt our Morals, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence we do not reckon Piety to conſiſt in affected Penances, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Mortifications, which for the moſt part have more ſhew than ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. We praiſe and recommend as earneſtly as we can the practice of Faſting, but believe it better to abſtain from Vice than Meats; the uſe of which God has given us with ſobriety. We believe every man ought to be content with the condition wherein God has placed him, to make good uſe of his Eſtate, and endure Poverty without envy, murmurings, and repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; to live holily in Caelibacy, and chaſtly in Marriage; to carry our ſelves juſtly to our Inferiors, and obediently to Superiors. But we do not
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:41961:291"/> approve of mens withdrawing themſelves out of that rank and order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in providence has placed them, nor making of particular rules, and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to th' obſervance of 'em by Vows, nor that the Rich ſhould ranſom their ſins by great offerings to Eccleſiaſtical perſons who have no need of 'em, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Century by theſe mortifications, he ſhall never perſuade reaſonable people that an age wherein appears on one hand an almoſt univerſal ignorance of all that is good, a prodigious neglect of the myſteries of Religion, an almoſt univerſal corruption of manners, a ſtrange kind of Devotion to all manner of Vices, a deplorable relaxation of Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline; and on the other ſeveral Monaſteries founded, and outward auſterity practis'd, that this could be an Age of <hi>Benediction and Grace.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>MOREOVER, what we have ſaid of <hi>Edgar</hi> King of <hi>England, Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the quarrel of the Eccleſiaſticks in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> has been grounded on good Teſtimonies. <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> tells us <hi>Edgar</hi> was reproached for diſhonoring the firſt years of his Reign with Cruelties, and ſtrange Pollutions, one of which was that being enamored with the Wife of <hi>Etelwold</hi> his Favorite, he got him out one day into the Forreſt to Hunt, and there cauſed him to be cruelly murder'd. Another of his wickedneſſes was the forcibly carrying away a Maid that he loved, who to avoid his purſuits had caſt her ſelf into a Monaſtery, and taken therein the Vail. Another time falling in love with a Dukes Daughter, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given orders to have her brought to him, the Mother who would not conſent her Daughter ſhould be diſhonored, ſubſtituted one of her Maids in her place, who was alſo very fair; which <hi>Edgar</hi> underſtanding, he was thereat ſo enraged that he changed their rank and quality, and made this Servant Miſtriſs over her own Miſtriſs. He a while after eſpouſed <hi>Elfride,</hi> the Widow of his Favorite, whom he had cauſed to be ſlain.</p>
                        <p>IT is ſaid that <hi>Dunſtan</hi> Excommunicated him, becauſe he had violated the reſpect due to a Monaſtery, and drew out thence a Woman who wore the Habit of a Religious, altho ſhe was none, and abuſed her. <hi>It's certain,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Guilliel. Malm. lib. 2. c. 8.</note> ſays he, <hi>that Wulfritte</hi> (for this was the Maids name) <hi>was not a Nun but a Laick, who fearing the King, had taken the Vail, which the King ſnatching from her abuſed her. At which</hi> Dunſtan <hi>being offended in that he dared to luſt, after a perſon that had only the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbra of Religion, made uſe of his Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical power againſt him.</hi> Now as we muſt judg of the zeal of <hi>Dunſtan</hi> from the Hiſtorians own words; ſo we cannot but ſay there was a great deal of hypocriſie in this action; for is it not an horrible hypocriſie to have leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Sacrament of Baptiſm, an Ordinance inſtituted by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>himſelf, than to this human inſtitution. <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> repreſents <hi>Dunſtan</hi> diſplaying all his Pontificial Power to revenge the outrage offer'd to the ſhadow of Religion, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde offenſum,</hi> ſays he, <hi>beatum Dunſtanum quod il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam concupiſſet quoe vel umbraticè ſanctimonialis fuiſſet, vigorem pontificalem in eum egiſſe,</hi> of the Conſecration of Baptiſm, or the enormity of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:41961:292"/> he ſays never a word. Let not Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> take it ill that I call this hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie. He ſays my cenſure is unjuſt, becauſe this Maid was Baptiz'd, and ſo <hi>Edgar</hi> had violated in her the character and the conſecration of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm as well as in the others. But what ſignifies this remark? This Maid was Baptiz'd without doubt; and for that reaſon we eſteem it ill that <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan</hi> grounded his ſeverity, and his Epiſcopal fury on a bare ſhadow of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion without any notice of her Baptiſm.</p>
                        <p>AS to the quarrel of the Eccleſiaſticks and Monks in <hi>England,</hi> I have ſaid nothing but what is grounded on the teſtimony of <hi>Polydor Virgil,</hi> as appears by what I related in my Anſwer to the <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> The Hiſtorian lays it upon <hi>the inſatiable covetouſneſs of the Monks,</hi> neither does he excuſe <note place="margin">Polydor.

                        <p>THE ſecond Anſwer is frivolous. We neither accuſe Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> nor his Friends perſonally for having done any thing to deprive us of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the manner in which the change hapned: whatſoever they have thereunto contributed conſiſts only in the falſe Citations, and Sophiſms in their Books, but of theſe we will not here complain. We only complain here of their drawing advantage from the ill means that have been uſed by other perſons on their ſide, whoſe Succeſſors and Defenders they are, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive Poſterity of the knowledg of th' Innovation in queſtion, and I believe there's a great deal of Juſtice in this complaint. A Council has cauſed <hi>John Scot</hi>'s Book to be burn'd, there are none to be had of 'em at this day. We have loſt the Writings of <hi>Heribald</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Auxerre,</hi> the Letter of <hi>Raban</hi> to <hi>Egilon, Eriger</hi>'s Book againſt <hi>Paſchaſus, Berenger</hi>'s Works, their Books who wrote in his favour in the 11th. Century. We know no more of this long Hiſtory than what we can gather here and there in ſuſpected Authors Adverſaries to <hi>Berengarius</hi> and his Doctrin. Moreover there have been given the publick under the name of the Fathers falſe and ſuppoſed Books: their real Works have been alter'd, and falſe pieces inſerted in them to make the world believe there were no Innovations in their Doctrin. I ſay <note place="margin">Anſwer to <hi>Noüet.</hi>
                           </note> nothing but what may be eaſily juſtified, and which I have already clearly proved elſewhere. If I complain of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s injuſtice who makes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of theſe frauds put upon us, and which he knows to be ſuch, in like manner as what the Emiſſaries have done in the Eaſt, whence he would make us believe they of thoſe parts have ever held Tranſubſtantiation and the Real Preſence. This is I think a complaint for which no rational perſon will condemn me.</p>
                        <p>I likewiſe propoſed ſome examples of inſenſible changes which have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Latin Church, whence I concluded 'twas not impoſſible one ſhould have hapned by the introduction of the Doctrins of Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the Real Preſence. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to extricate himſelf out of the perplexity which theſe examples cauſed him, has deviſed ſome diſtinctions, ſome of 'em imaginary, and others unneceſſary, by means whereof he has pretended to invalidate the change in queſtion, and they are theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences which we muſt now examine.</p>
                        <pb n="190" facs="tcp:41961:293"/>
                        <p>IT cannot be denied but that the cuſtom of communicating of both kinds, that of giving the Communion to little Children, and that of Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till the Evening, and ſome others have been chang'd in the Latin Church. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does not gain-ſay it, but tells us theſe cuſtoms are ſtill uſed in the Eaſtern Churches, ſo that the change has not been vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, whereas if that of the eſtabliſhment of Tranſubſtantiation were true, <hi>we muſt ſuppoſe it hapned at the ſame time throughout all the world, and all Chriſtian Churches.</hi> This is his firſt difference which he amplifies and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerates after his manner. But the anſwer is not difficult, to wit, that there is not any Tranſubſtantiation or Real Preſence, ſuch as the Roman Church holds in the Eaſtern Churches, or if there be, 'tis brought in by the Emiſſaries and Scholars of the Romiſh Seminaries: beſides that a change is not ever the leſs inſenſible in reſpect of thoſe that have admitted it, for its being leſs univerſal.</p>
                        <p>THE ſecond difference is, that in the greateſt part of th' expreſſions which I propoſe the point concerns ſome eſtabliſh'd cuſtom, whereas here the queſtion is touching a new Doctrin univerſally eſtabliſh'd, <hi>which is,</hi> ſays he, <hi>extremely different, a general inconveniency may univerſally aboliſh a cuſtom; but when the queſtion is touching the remedying of an abuſe every man follows his particular judgment in the choice of remedies. And this eſpecially ſhews us th' impoſſibility of the change in the ſubject of the Euchariſt. For this muſt be ſaid to be an univerſal eſtabliſhment of an extraordinary Doctrin which cannot ſubſiſt with the infinite diverſity of judgments, reſpects and inclinations which happen in ſo many different Churches, which being divided in ſuch ſmall matters, cannot be expected to unite in a Doctrin ſo offenſive that 'tis ſtrange it has found any followers, neither could it, had it not been authoriz'd by an univerſal conſent.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I confeſs there's a great deal of difference betwixt an ancient cuſtom that is aboliſh'd, and a new Doctrin that is eſtabliſh'd. But this difference does Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> more hurt than good. For ignorant people are more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to conſerve their cuſtoms which they know, than they are to reject a Doctrin which they know but imperfectly, and concerning whoſe novelty they cannot judg. When an ancient publick and perpetual cuſtom is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd, th' innovation is more manifeſt than when a new Doctrin is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, for the novelty of it is conceal'd, 'tis offer'd as being the ancient Faith; and they that offer it pervert for this effect ſome ordinary expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, turning 'em into another ſenſe. Cuſtoms are of themſelves popular, and when they are changed, people are apt to imagin their Religion is about being taken away from 'em: but as to Doctrinals, the people are wont to ſuffer thoſe that have greateſt authority in the Church to preach what they pleaſe, and obediently receive it without any examination. As to the reſt, 'tis certain there has hapned ſomething in reference to the Euchariſt, which is like what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> obſerves, that when we leave an ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom every man takes a different courſe, and follows his own particular judgment. For the Latins and Greeks in departing from the plain and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine explication of the Ancients, which was, that the Bread and Wine of the Euchariſt are figures and images of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, have faln upon different ſentiments, the Greeks having taken the party of the union of the Bread with the Divinity, and augmentation of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Latins that of Tranſubſtantiation. But we muſt
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:41961:293"/> not paſs over in ſilence what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> confeſſes, that the Doctrin of the Latins is ſo offenſive that 'tis ſtrange it has found any followers, had it not been authoriſed by an univerſal conſent. This acknowledgment muſt at leaſt ſhew the world how important it is to prevent being abuſed by this pretended univerſal conſent, and engaging in a ſentiment which moreover is ſo offenſive. But as the diſcuſſion of this queſtion touching the univerſal conſent has no proportion with the capacity of moſt people, this very thing ſhould ſhew, that to ground ones Faith on a ſolid foundation, wherein there's no deceit to be feared, the beſt which one can do, is to keep to the Word of God.</p>
                        <p>THE third difference which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> remarks conſiſts in that the changes which I alledg are changes of Practice and Diſcipline, whereas that in queſtion is a change of Opinion and Doctrin. <hi>Now,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Diſcipline is a thing of it ſelf liable to change, and the benefit of it depends on circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are mutable; but Doctrins are immutable in their own nature: that which is true at one time being ſo always. Every body knows that Diſciplin may be alter'd, and every one knows that Doctrins cannot change. So,</hi> adds he, <hi>to introduce a new Diſcipline, 'tis not neceſſary to deceive the world, nor ſhew 'tis ancient, but to introduce a new Doctrin the novelty muſt of neceſſity de diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed, which is oftentimes impoſſible. In fine, the belief of a Doctrin neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily imports the condemnation of the contrary opinion, whereas one may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a Diſcipline different from another, yet without condemning that which one leaves.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THERE are ſeveral things to be ſaid to this diſcourſe. For firſt, It is not true that all the points of Practice and Diſcipline are mutable. The practices which our Saviour Chriſt himſelf has inſtituted in his Church with an expreſs command of obſerving 'em are perpetual, immutable, and neceſſary, at leaſt as to neceſſity of precept, and ſuch is the Communion of both kinds. Secondly, There are few perſons amongſt the people that are prepoſſeſſed with this opinion that the points of practice and Diſcipline may be changed, the greateſt part go not ſo far as this diſtinction of points of Practice, and Doctrins. The aboliſhment of a practice rather appears to them a change of Religion than an abolition or introduction of a Doctrin, becauſe of two parts whereof a Religion conſiſts, to wit, the Doctrins, and Practices, theſe laſt are moſt popular. Thirdly, There are practices which are ſo ſtrictly joyn'd with Doctrins, and are in ſuch a manner the dependan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and conſequences of 'em, that 'tis impoſſible to change them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out alſo changing the Doctrins, and conſequently without condemning all contrary Doctrins. Such is the practice of communicating under both kinds; for it was anciently grounded on this belief, that Chriſt's command belongs as well to Miniſters as the People; as appears by <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his own teſtimony, <hi>Drink ye all of it,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to wit, as well the Miniſters as other</hi>

                           <hi>Believers:</hi> and this was joyn'd with the condemnation of the contrary pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. <hi>It is not well done,</hi> ſays the ſame <hi>Paſchaſus, to Communicate of the Fleſh without the Blood: This Myſtery,</hi> ſays Pope <hi>Gelaſius, cannot be divided without committing a great Sacrilege. It is a mere abuſing the world,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud, to pretend to eſtabliſh an univerſal Doctrin which is received in the whole Church on a ſingle paſſage of a Popes Writings, recited by</hi> Gratien, <hi>and to oppoſe this ſingle paſſage againſt the conſtant practice of all the Churches in the world, who have given the Communion to the faithful under one ſpecies in ſundry occaſions.</hi> But of whom would Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> have us to learn bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:41961:294"/> the belief of the Church in the time of <hi>Gelaſius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who was at the head of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who calls her ſelf the faithful depoſitory of Tradition? Is Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſo ſcandaliz'd at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of a Teſtimony of a Pope? <hi>It is Gratien,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that relates it.</hi> Is it the leſs authentick for that? <hi>Gratien</hi> did not invent it to ſerve us, we did not inſpire him with it; and the Correctors of <hi>Gratien</hi> have not ſo much as doubted of it. <hi>This paſſage,</hi> adds he, <hi>may receive ſeveral rational explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> I know he endeavours to elude every thing by explications, but we ſhould know whether theſe explications be juſt: Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe 'em, and then we might examin 'em. This conſtant practice of all the Churches that have given the Communion to the faithful under one kind in ſeveral occaſions is likewiſe a thing that ought to be proved. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> knows he need not long ſtay for an anſwer, to what's alledg'd touching that ſubject.</p>
                        <p>THE Communion of little Children is likewiſe another practice appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to a Doctrin, for the ancient Church had this cuſtom, becauſe ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd this Communion abſolutely neceſſary for the ſalvation of Infants.

But ſeeing the command to receive the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt does not oblige thoſe that cannot receive it, and that we muſt reckon them unfit to receive the Euchariſt that cannot receive it with the reſpect due to it, the Church, inſtructed by the uſe of ſeveral Ages, and the Decree of the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>has well determin'd, not only that the reception of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt is not neceſſary to Children, but that it ought not to be given 'em.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>I know,</hi> adds Mr. <hi>Arnaud, that there are on this ſubject ſome paſſages of</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Page 990.</note> 
                           <hi>S.</hi> Auſtin <hi>and</hi> Innocent <hi>the Firſt, which are difficult. But Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>knows very well that</hi> Fulgentius <hi>and</hi> Bede <hi>have explained theſe paſſages. He knows alſo that Cardinal</hi> Perron <hi>and ſeveral other Catholick Authors have ſolved them.</hi> To the paſſages of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and <hi>Innocent,</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> might add others, which will admit of no explication, as thoſe of <hi>Gelaſius</hi> the Firſt in one of his Epiſtles, of the Author of the <hi>Hypognoſticks,</hi> of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Second, of the ſecond Council of <hi>Toul,</hi> and ſome others. And as to the ſoft'ning Expoſitions of <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> they hinder not but that the opinion of the ancient Church was in effect what we now preſented, as alſo the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers of Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> which are for the moſt part but mere illuſions.</p>
                        <p>WE may reckon amongſt the practices depending on a Doctrin that of the relative adoration of Images which has inſinuated it ſelf into <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> ſince the 8th. and 9th. Century. For it is certain that in all
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:41961:294"/> the foregoing Ages and long after, <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> rejected this Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as unlawful and contrary to true Piety. Which appears by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Francfort</hi> held under <hi>Charlemain,</hi> and conſiſting of above three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Biſhops, of <hi>France, Italy, Germany,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> wherein the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice</hi> was condemned. This moreover appears by the Book of Images of <hi>Charlemain,</hi> by the Teſtimonies of <hi>Agobard</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lyons, Jonas</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and <hi>Walafridus Strabo,</hi> by the Council of <hi>Paris,</hi> under <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Debonnair,</hi> and by the Continuer of <hi>Climoinus.</hi> We find likewiſe in <hi>Nicetas Choniatus</hi> that the Germans in the 12th. Century perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in this opinion. <hi>The Germans,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and the Armenians agree in this,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Nicet. Choni. l.</hi> 2. Page 986.</note> 
                           <hi>that they reject the worſhiping of Images.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> who cannot deny ſo plain a matter of fact, ſays, that the Biſhops of <hi>Francfort admitted the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Croſs, which is only an image of the true Croſs, that they admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted likewiſe the hiſtorical uſe of images; and that without doing violence to nature, the hiſtorical uſe of Images cannot be ſeparated from the relative ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the ſame images.</hi> But this is an impertinent diſputing againſt the Fathers of <hi>Francfort,</hi> and the Churches that have follow'd them. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not whether they were contrary to themſelves, or whether they did violence to nature. But whether it be true that the contrary belief and practice have inſenſibly crept into theſe very Churches, without noiſe, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and diſputations. Now this is what cannot be denied.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>IT is not at all ſtrange,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud, that the particular opinion of theſe Biſhops which is contrary to nature, reaſon, and the general conſent of the whole Church ſhould be laid aſide, and that the Popes who uſed this condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards 'em did not openly oppoſe 'em, but tarried till time wore out this Error, whereby they have had the ſucceſs which they expected from ſo chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table a conduct. So far is it from being ſtrange that this ſhould happen, that 'twould be a greater wonder if this has not hapned.</hi> This methinks is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing too freely of the judgments and conſent of rational people. It will not then be ſtrange according to Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> that the Popes, and all this party that were in the opinion and practice of the relative adoration of Images ſhould uſe any condeſcention towards three hundred Biſhops aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Council, the Kingdom of <hi>France;</hi> and all <hi>Germany</hi> which were in a contrary Belief and practice, that they ſhould be cautious of oppoſing them in this particular, and patiently expect till time remedied this miſtake. But according to the ſame Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> this will be the greateſt of all follies, and the higheſt extravagancy imaginable to ſuppoſe that ſome <hi>Paſchaſiſts,</hi> and <hi>Bertramiſts,</hi> which is to ſay, thoſe that believed the Real Preſence, and thoſe that believed it not in the 10th. Century, did not diſpute one againſt another: and altho that moreover they were not in a condition to diſpute, and had other things to trouble themſelves about, other intereſts to mind, yet muſt it be a folly to imagin they were of that patient and charitable diſpoſition the Popes were of, who referred theſe things to be remedied by time. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> forbids us to be aſtoniſh'd at <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germanies</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly changing a Doctrin and a Rite; he forbids us to concern our ſelves about the queſtions of the birth and progreſs of this change, the ſtupidity of the Biſhops on both ſides, who look'd upon one another as Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated perſons, yet without daring to ſpeak to one another about it, being withheld by a holy condeſcention, and the hope of the good effects of time, and by the marvellous meekneſs of the Laicks, ſome of whom were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipers of Images and others not, and ſome of 'em conſequently Anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd by the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and others condemned by that of <hi>Francfort,</hi>
                           <pb n="194" facs="tcp:41961:295"/> and yet lived in peace, without noiſe, without mutual oppoſitions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſputes. But if we will hear him on the other change touching the Euchariſt, he commands us not only to be aſtoniſh'd, but to eſteem it a fearful prodigy that the Doctrin of the Real Preſence which ſprang up in the 9th. Century, was taught and maintain'd as being the ancient and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Doctrin of the Fathers, ſhould make inſenſible progreſſes during the darkneſs of the 10th. Century, and that there ſhould have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the ſame Church that have believed it, and others that have not, without falling foul upon, and oppoſing one another. When the queſtion of the adoration of Images was agitated in the Eaſt, it vehemently heated mens minds, ſo that each party proceeded to Anathema's, Baniſhments, and Blood-ſhed: and in the Weſt, the contrary party to the Adoration wrote, and held Aſſemblies, whereas when the queſtion of the Real Preſence was handled, in the 9th. Century there were neither Councils called, nor Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema's pronounced, nor Baniſhments, nor any extraordinary matter. Yet in reſpect of the former, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will that by virtue of condeſcention and th' effects of time, the Party for the Adoration has inſenſibly fortifi'd themſelves, and at length got the upper hand; but as to the other he will not grant that the Real Preſence could advance and communicate it ſelf to ſeveral perſons, but the whole Univerſe muſt be ſhaken with it. Let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then Judg of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s equity.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>NOTHING,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is more aſtoniſhing than this univerſal forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Page 287.</note> 
                           <hi>in the 11th. Century, whether there was therein any other Doctrin amongſt Chriſtians than that of the Real Preſence.</hi> But who told him that they of the 11th. Century forgot the conteſt which had been in the 9th. Was not <hi>John Scot</hi>'s Book burnt by a Council? Let him forget it if he will, there will redound no advantage to him by it, ſeeing 'tis certain that in the 9th. Century the Doctrin contrary to the Real Preſence was taught; I mean, that which aſſerts the Euchariſt not to be the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, Chriſt born of the Virgin, and that 'tis only the Body of Jeſus Chriſt Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally and virtually. Moreover, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does not obſerve that this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing is againſt him; for if it be true that thoſe of the 11th. Century forgot ſuch a matter of fact as that which is juſtifi'd by the teſtimony of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> himſelf, this is a ſufficient mark that the 10th. Century which holds the middle between the 9th. and 11th. was o'reſpread with thick darkneſs, ſeeing the ideas, and memory of a thing ſo conſiderable were therein loſt.</p>
                        <p>BUT we muſt examin his fourth difference. <hi>A fourth circumſtance,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Page 960.</note> ſays he, <hi>which does further ſtrangely diſtinguiſh this pretended change in the Doctrin of the Euchariſt, from all theſe other changes, is the very nature of this Doctrin.</hi> (He means of the Real Preſence and Tranſubſtantiation.) <hi>For it is clear, that had it been new it muſt have extraordinarily ſurpriz'd all thoſe that never heard of it, which is to ſay the whole Church.</hi> I confeſs that in effect the Doctrin of the Converſion of Subſtances in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt has ſomething in it that is very ſurprizing and more offenſive than what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is done in other changes. But Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> knows very well that this quality of offenſive and ſurprizing in a Doctrin, is not ſtrong enough to produce actually of it ſelf an oppoſition or a rejection; on the contrary, moſt people love in matters of Religion thoſe things that are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing and wonderful, of which we ſee examples in moſt Religions. But howſoever the Teachers of the Real Preſence provided againſt this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:41961:295"/> three ways, the firſt was the making 'em a Buckler of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power of God. The ſecond, the publiſhing of Miracles which really hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about the Euchariſt, to wit, viſible apparitions of Fleſh and Blood. And the third, the aſſerting 'twas always the Faith and belief of the Church, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating to their ſenſe ſome paſſages of the Fathers ill taken and ill explained.</p>
                        <p>HITHERTO we have had whatſoever Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has ſaid that is conſiderable on the queſtion of the poſſibility or impoſſibility of the change in his 6th. and 9th. Book. Whatſoever is therein of moment we have conſidered and anſwer'd ſolidly and pertinently as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I hope, will acknowledg. I ſhould have been very glad if he would have told us his opinion on a paſſage, taken out of a Book, called, <hi>The new Hereſie publickly maintain'd at</hi> Paris <hi>in the College of</hi> Clermont. The Author of this Book therein diſcovers the order and means which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends his adverſaries uſe to introduce Novelties inſenſibly into the Church, and he inſtances for this purpoſe the Parable of the Tares that were ſown in the night, whilſt men ſlept, which took root, and in time grew up, which is very near the manner after which, according to us, the change was wrought touching the Euchariſt, This Author has well comprehended it, as judging it far from being impoſſible; but Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> thought meet to ſay nothing to this paſſage.</p>
                        <p>I ſhould likewiſe been very glad, that having treated as he has done with great earneſtneſs of the Doctrin of the Greek and other Eaſtern Churches, he had made reflection on ſeveral Doctrins and Practices which ſeparate them from the Latins, and in which there have hapned of neceſſity, either amongſt the one or the others, inſenſible changes. For example, how came it to paſs the Greeks loſt the belief of Purgatory, ſuppoſing this were a Doctrin of the firſt eſtabliſhment of Chriſtian Religion. How came they to believe the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father alone, and alſo that unleaven'd Bread in the adminiſtration of the Euchariſt is an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and likewiſe that the Prieſts may as well as the Biſhops adminiſter Confirmation; and again, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not infallible in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, and that the Saints enjoy not the beatifical viſion of God till the Reſurrection: and in ſhort, how came they to believe all the reſt of thoſe opinions which they hold contrary to thoſe of the Latins? There muſt of neceſſity have been a time wherein the Greeks and Latins were agreed in all theſe Articles, whether we conceive that then neither of 'em held them, which is to ſay, that theſe Articles be not of Apoſtolical Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether we ſuppoſe they held them in common ſince the firſt Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſtianity, which ſuppoſes that theſe Opinions were left 'em by the Apoſtles, or whether we imagin that the Greeks as well as the Latins have ever held what they now hold at this day, but that they ſupported mutually one another, which ſuppoſes that both of 'em held theſe Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as needleſs ones, and regarded the contrary opinions as tolerable ones. Now in whatſoever ſort we take it, there have of neceſſity hapned inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble changes without diſpute, noiſe, and oppoſition, altho there may be the ſame objections brought againſt 'em, and the ſame queſtions ſtarted which the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> have urged againſt the change in queſtion.</p>
                        <pb n="196" facs="tcp:41961:296"/>
                        <p>SHOULD we ſuppoſe a time wherein neither the one nor the other held theſe Opinions, how come they in fine to be imbued ſo generally with 'em, and ſo contradictorily, that a whole Church ſhould hold the contrary of what the other believes? Is there not in this double change at leaſt as much reaſon to be aſtoniſh'd and ſurpriz'd, as in that which has hapned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to us, in reſpect of the Real Preſence? Have both the Latins and Greeks faln aſleep without knowing any thing of the fire of Purgatory, or Proceſſion of the Holy Spirit, or quality which the Euchariſtical Bread ought to be of, or th' adminiſtration of Confirmation, or Beatifical Viſion of the Saints, nor th' Infallibility of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and have they all together at the ſame time awaken'd poſſeſs'd with contrary opinions on each of theſe points? Whence had they their opinions? Did not he who firſt taught them 'em advertiſe 'em that he Preached Novelties to 'em which they never heard of? If he did tell 'em of this, 'tis ſtrange he ſhould be followed immediately by his whole Church, and that ſuch new Doctrins ſhould be ſo immediately and zealouſly embraced. If he did not tell 'em this, 'tis then very ſtrange no body took notice of theſe Innovations, that the Biſhops and Prieſts did not oppoſe 'em, and that of all that innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable multitude of Religious perſons not one of 'em has exclaimed againſt the Innovator. Had the Innovator made uſe of ſome expreſſions of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and of the Church to conceal the novelty of theſe Doctrins, and to make people believe that that was the ancient Faith, how can one conceive theſe terrible equivocations, that expreſſions have been taken in one ſenſe during a certain time generally by the whole Latin Church, or generally by the whole Greek Church, and that immediately in another, they have been taken generally by the ſame Churches in another ſenſe?</p>
                        <p>IF we ſuppoſe a time wherein both Greeks and Latins believed the ſame thing in reſpect of theſe points, the ſame difficulties and the ſame queſtions return in reſpect of that of the two Churches which has changed. Suppoſe for example that the Greeks and Latins both believed the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is infallible, that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, that one may uſe indifferently in the Euchariſt unleavened Bread, and that which is leaven'd, and that the Biſhop alone has the right of Confirmation, how happens it the Greeks have paſs'd into contrary Opinions without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions amongſt 'em till the Council of <hi>Florence?</hi> Has this hapned all at a ſtroke? Was this done inſenſibly and by ſucceſſion of time? If this has hapned all at once, it muſt be granted this change is exceeding ſtrange, that ſo many Biſhops, Prieſts, and Religious ſhould ſo ſuddenly renounce their former Opinions, and embrace contrary ones without any Diviſions amongſt 'em. But 'tis yet ſtrange, they ſhould change 'em without perceiving it, without acknowledging they had made great and conſiderable Innovations in their Church, and comparing their firſt and ancient Faith with this new one. For 'tis certain that in reſpect of all theſe Articles which are in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, the Greeks poſitively maintain and have ever maintain'd they have not innovated in any thing. If this change was wrought by ſucceſſion of time, let us be ſhew'd the Diſputes and Diviſions they have had amongſt 'em ſince on theſe Articles they have ſeparated from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> till the Greek Empire fell into the hands of the Latins, which is to ſay du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring above two hundred and fifty years. If it be alledg'd the change was made inſenſibly, we muſt return to the four times of the Author of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity,</hi> and apply to 'em the ſame difficulties and objections he has raiſed.</p>
                        <pb n="197" facs="tcp:41961:296"/>
                        <p>IN fine, if we ſuppoſe a time wherein the two Churches held each of 'em their Opinions, yet mutually bearing with one another without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to an expreſs condemnation of the contrary Opinions, beſides that it is difficult to comprehend how the Latins believing the Roman Church infallible, and their Sacrifice with unleaven'd Bread good and lawful, could ſuffer the Greeks holding on the contrary that the Roman Church may err in matters of Faith. Beſides this, I ſay, 'twill be demanded how they could change ſo ſuddenly their Opinion in reference to the controverted Articles, holding 'em before for unneceſſary points, and afterwards for neceſſary ones, reſpecting before the contrary Opinions to theirs as tolerable Errors, and afterwards reſpecting 'em as abominable and intolerable ones: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon one may make the ſame queſtions, how it could come to paſs that the whole Greek Church has believ'd at one time that the Euchariſt of the Latins with unleaven'd Bread was nevertheleſs the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt, an object of ſupreme Adoration, and in another that 'twas only a dead Azym, a Jewiſh abomination; that ſhe ſhould reſpect it at one time with that Reverence and Devotion due only to the Son of God, and at another immediately ſucceeding the firſt, which is to ſay from night to morning, regard it with horror, waſhing and purifying the Altars whereon it had been celebrated as if they had been polluted.</p>
                        <p>WE may apply the ſame queſtions and difficulties to the Armenians, Jacobites, Coptics, Neſtorians, in reference to ſeveral of their Opinions of which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> cannot ſhew the original, nor tell us after what manner they were diſperſed amongſt theſe people, nor how they have left the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinions which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſtill holds as being of Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Tradition. How has it hapned for inſtance that the Neſtorians have left the uſe of Confirmation, and that of Extreme Unction, that the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobites have left that of Confeſſion, and the belief of Purgatory, that the Coptics have laid aſide the Doctrin of Purgatory, and uſe of Extreme Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſo of the reſt. For Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> I think, would have me ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that according to him theſe points have been heretofore held and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd by all Chriſtians.</p>
                        <p>THESE examples do clearly diſcover the vanity of theſe pretended moral impoſſibilities which the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> have urged with ſuch great exaggeration. For they may be all as ſtrongly applied to the changes which have hapned in theſe Eaſtern Churches, and yet it muſt be granted that theſe changes hapned there. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue as long as he pleaſes, ſtart queſtions, and raiſe difficulties, theſe inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble changes are more than poſſible, for they are come to paſs either in theſe Churches, or in the Latin, which has Opinions, and contrary Cuſtoms, which ſhews that theſe Gentlemens whole Philoſophy is but a mere Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, proper only for perſons that abound with leiſure, which does not at all agree with the manner after which things are carried on in the world.</p>
                        <p>BUT in ſhort the uſe which is made of the Seminaries, and Miſſions, and the courſe which the Emiſſaries take in the Eaſt, as we have obſerv'd in the ſecond Book, with the project of <hi>Thomas à Jeſu</hi> to make in a ſhort time, all the Greeks, good Roman Catholicks, according as I have related in the fourth Book; all this I ſay ſhews clearly that at <hi>Rome,</hi> and elſewhere amongſt the moſt zealous, it is not at all accounted impoſſible to introduce
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:41961:297"/> inſenſibly, and without diſturbance the Doctrins of the Romiſh Church amongſt people that have 'em not, and in effect it muſt be granted that their preſent labors are not unſucceſsful, and that time will probably finiſh the work.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>WE muſt come now to particular matters of fact which relate to the Hiſtory of the Change. Not but to ſpeak truly this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion appears to me very needleſs, conſidering what we have already done. For if the principal queſtion which reſpects the novelty of Tranſubſtantiation and the Real Preſence be ended, and moreover there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from our Diſpute that the change was poſſible, and that there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more vain than the objections which the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> have made on this ſubject, I ſee not any neceſſity there is of informing a man's ſelf in what manner this change hapned. What matter is it to us who was the firſt Author of this Innovation, who the promoters of it, what facilities or difficulties were met with in the eſtabliſhing of theſe Doctrins, whether <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> carried on his buſineſs with craft, or ſimplicity; whether <hi>John Scot, Bertram,</hi> and <hi>Raban</hi> wrote againſt him before or after his death? What ſignifies the knowing of theſe things provided we are certain not only that the change in queſtion was poſſible, but actually hapned? And this does now appear ſo plainly as will ſatisfie every rational man. In examining Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s 6th. and 9th. Book we have made it appear that his pretended impoſſibilities are mere chimera's. And as to the actual change, beſides that we ſhall always have right to take it for granted by our proofs of fact, which is to ſay by the paſſages of the Fathers, which we have ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, till Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> and his friends have taken pains to anſwer 'em ſolidly: beſides this, I ſay, what I ſhewed concerning the Eaſtern Churches not hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doctrins in queſtion, neither in the 11th. nor following Centuries, and the Greeks and Latins not knowing 'em in the 7th. and 8th. Century, is more than ſufficient for the concluding that theſe Doctrins are not of the firſt eſtabliſhment of Chriſtian Religion, and conſequently that their introduction is an innovation. Yet will I not deſiſt from examining the points of Hiſtory which reſpect this change, becauſe this change is indeed the firſt and principal ſubject of the Diſpute between Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> and us.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Paſchaſus Ratbert,</hi> a Religious of <hi>Corbie</hi> that lived in the 9th. Century was (according to us) the firſt who taught the converſion of the ſubſtances of the Bread and Wine, and the Real Preſence of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in the Euchariſt. He treats of theſe Points in three different places of his works, in his Book <hi>of the Body and Blood of our Lord,</hi> in his Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on the 26th. Chapter of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and in his Letter to <hi>Frudegard.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 8. ch. 8. page 36.</note> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> calls our pretenſion on this ſubject <hi>a new Hypotheſis and a</hi>

                           <hi>pure work of fancy. But,</hi> adds he, <hi>as mens fancies are very different, that of other Miniſters who wrote beſore</hi> Aubertin <hi>turn'd not on this hinge, as not thinking 'twere their intereſt to ſet 'emſelves more againſt</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>than other Authors of that Century.

                        </p>
                        <p>IT muſt be acknowledg'd there is a great deal of rancor and injuſtice in this diſcourſe. Firſt, ſeeing Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> himſelf affirms that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> taught the Real Preſence and Tranſubſtantiation, why does he make it criminal in Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi> and me to do the ſame? Does the averſion which he has to our perſons tranſport him ſo far, that he cannot endure we ſhould be agreed with him, no not in one point? I acknowledg that as oft as Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi> and I affirm <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> taught the Real Preſence and Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, we do at the ſame time add that he was an Innovator, wherein we are at odds with Mr. <hi>Arnaud.</hi> But why may we not at leaſt agree with him in one Point, if we cannot in more? Let him oppoſe us as oft as he will touching th' innovation of <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> we ſhall not diſlike it, for he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains his own ſentiment; but let him give us leave to tell him that <hi>Paſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> alſo taught the Real Preſence and Tranſubſtantiation, ſeeing that herein we ſay nothing but what he himſelf aſſerts, and all Roman Catholicks with him.</p>
                        <p>SECONDLY, 'tis not generally true that thoſe who wrote before Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi> did not acknowledg that the Doctrin of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> was the Real Preſence and Tranſubſtantiation. The Author of the Orthodox Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe <note place="margin">Page 479.</note> touching the Euchariſt, Printed at <hi>Lyons</hi> in the year 1595. expreſly mentions that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> laid the foundations of Tranſubſtantiation, and Conſubſtantiation. Mr. <hi>Le Faucheur</hi> ſays he taught that the Euchariſt <note place="margin">Lib. 9. Ch. 6.</note> was the proper Body and the proper Blood of Jeſus Chriſt reſiding ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially in the Bread and Wine. <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> ranks him amongſt thoſe that <note place="margin">Book 4. of the Sacrament pretended in the Maſs. ch. 8</note> have propoſed a contrary Doctrin to that of the Fathers and the Church. And long before them <hi>Berenger</hi> himſelf attributed to <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> the Doctrin of the converſion of the ſubſtances as well as we. <hi>Sententia,</hi> ſaid he, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Lanfranc de Corp. &amp; Sang. Dom.</note> to <hi>Lanfranc, imo vecordia vulgi, Paſchaſi, atque Lanfranci minime ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe in altari poſt conſecrationem ſubſtantiam panis &amp; vini.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT 'tis needleſs to cite Authorities, when the point concerns a matter which may be clear'd by reading <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> himſelf. He that takes pains to read exactly his Book <hi>De Corpore &amp; ſanguine Domini,</hi> his Commentaries on the 26. of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and his Letter to <hi>Frudegard,</hi> will find, Firſt, That he held and taught the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine was changed abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely into the ſame Fleſh which is born of the Virgin, which died, and roſe again, altho the colour, and ſavor of Bread and Wine ſtill remains. Secondly,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:41961:298"/> That he held and taught that the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt enters into our fleſh, and that as he has joyn'd our ſubſtance to his Divinity, ſo he will have <hi>his ſubſtance</hi> to be in our fleſh. Thirdly, That he held and taught, that the words of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> muſt be underſtood neither of the figure of his Body, nor his Body in the Sacrament, nor of his Body in virtue, but of his Body born of the Virgin, Crucified and Riſen, <hi>in propriety of nature.</hi> Fourthly, That he diſputed as ſtrongly as he could againſt thoſe that held the contrary. Fifthly, That there were made againſt his Doctrin ſuch objections as naturally ariſe from the Real Preſence, ſuch as the Roman Church does at this day believe it to be. Sixthly, That he endeavoured to anſwer theſe objections on the Hypotheſis of the Roman Church.</p>
                        <p>IT hence, methinks very clearly reſults that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> held and taught the ſame Real Preſence, and the ſame ſubſtantial converſion, as <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. and <hi>Innocent</hi> III. eſtabliſh'd ſince in the Latin Church, and that this truth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be call'd in queſtion. Yet muſt what I obſerved in my anſwer to the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> be remembred, that the Book <hi>De Corpore &amp; Sanguine Domini</hi> does not every where contain the Doctrin of the converſion of ſubſtances in a manner ſo expreſs, or uniform, but that there are here and there ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral paſſages which ſeem at firſt to favour the ſubſiſtence of the Bread, and ſeveral others that are capable of a Sacramental ſence, or may be turn'd to the union of the Bread with the Divinity, acording to <hi>Damaſcen</hi>'s Doctrin. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> muſt grant me this, ſeeing he ſometimes alledges <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his expreſſions, t'elude ſuch kind of ones which are to be met with in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Now hence it has hapned that ſeveral Proteſtants having been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by theſe paſſages, have reckon'd this Author amongſt the number of thoſe that held not Tranſubſtantiation. But their error having ſprang from the want of attentive examining the depths of his Doctrin, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does not do right in drawing hence advantage againſt thoſe that have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a more exact ſcrutiny of him, eſpecially conſidering that this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion juſtifies it ſelf by the bare reading of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Writings, and that this is moreover Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s own ſentiment, and that alſo of his whole Church.</p>
                        <p>WE need only now ſee whether <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> in teaching the Real Preſence and Tranſubſtantiation has been an Innovator, that is to ſay, whether he firſt taught a Doctrin which no body ever before him did teach. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> affirms, that according to my proper Principles this would be impoſſibly human. His reaſon is that I ſaid in ſome places of my anſwer, <hi>That the expreſſions of the Fathers were not of themſelves capable to give riſe to this opinion, and therefore the idea of it muſt come from elſewhere. That ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing theſe expreſſions and a thouſand ſuch like were every day uttered by the Fathers, they could never form in the peoples minds the idea of a Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, or a Real Preſence, ſuch as the Roman Church teaches, unleſs they were propoſſeſſed with it by ſome other means. That there's no likelihood that before</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>made this firſt explication, men abandoned their ſenſes and reaſon to conceive the Real Preſence, and that certainly no place but the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and idle Convent of</hi> Corbie <hi>could bring forth ſuch an extravagant fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Let a man upon this judg,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud, what kind of blade this</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 8. ch. 8. p. 839.</note> Paſchaſus <hi>muſt be according to Mr.</hi> Claude, <hi>ſeeing that on one hand he was able to invent an opinion which could never come into any bodies head but his own; and further had the power and good luck to perſuade the whole world in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the belief of it with circumſtances which are yet more admirable. Certainly this is beyond the reach of man.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="201" facs="tcp:41961:298"/>
                        <p>I ANSWER, that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> draws his conſequences always ill. We ſaid that the people who uſually follow the lights of nature and common ſenſe, and whoſe meditations are not ſtrong enough of 'emſelves to invent this pretended manner of making the Body of Jeſus Chriſt to exiſt in Heaven and on Earth both at a time, could not raiſe the idea of this from the expreſſions of the Fathers, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> hence concludes 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> has invented this opinion, or been able to perſuade others to embrace it. This conſequence is abſurd, for we have examples of ſuch kind of perſons as <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> who have wandred from the true lights of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and faln into remote imaginations, which no body ever had before 'em, and which the people were (certainly) never capable of. I confeſs that in ſome reſpect one may marvel at theſe figuaries of human invention, becauſe they are irregularities, it being likewiſe aſtoniſhing to ſee men ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſo many diſorders; but it muſt not be hence concluded that theſe diſorders are more <hi>than human,</hi> or that 'tis impoſſible for a people who did did not invent an opinion themſelves, to follow it when 'tis well contrived and coloured. We ſee this happens every day, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſhould propoſe ſomething more ſolid.</p>
                        <p>THE true way to know whether <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> was an Innovator or not, is to enquire whether thoſe that went before him taught the ſame Doctrin, for if they did, we are to blame in charging him with an innovation; but if on the contrary we find their Doctrin different from his, we cannot doubt but he innovated. And this is the courſe Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi> has taken; for he offers not the hiſtory of the change, of which he makes <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> the firſt Author, till he ſhew'd by an exact diſcuſſion of each particular Century, that till <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his time no body ever ſpake like him; whence it follows of neceſſity, that he was an Innovator. It belong'd therefore to Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> and the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> (had they deſign'd to deal ſincerely) to take this courſe, and ſhew that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> ſaid nothing but what others ſaid before him. This would have been an eaſie and direct method, ſuppoſing <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> had not been an Innovator, but Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does not like the engaging in theſe kind of diſcuſſions.</p>
                        <p>HE thought it more for his purpoſe to fall upon a fruitleſs criticiſm by which he pretends to conclude, <hi>That no body publickly declared himſelf</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 8. ch. 8. p. 841.</note> 
                           <hi>againſt</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>his Book all the time he lived, That no body wrote againſt him, That no Biſhop, no Abbot of his Order reproached him with it, That there were only ſome perſons who ſhew'd in ſecret they were frighted at theſe truths, and ſaid not in writing, but in particular diſcourſes, that he had gone too far, and yet this was not till three years after he had publiſh'd his Book.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>SUPPOSING this remark to be as certain, as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has made it, what advantage will he pretend hence? Will <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> be ever the leſs an Innovator for his not finding any thing publiſh'd againſt him during his life? All that can be concluded hence is, that his Book was but little known at firſt, and afterwards but of ſmall eſteem with great men; and that if they believed themſelves oblig'd at length to write againſt his Doctrin, 'twas on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe they ſaw ſeveral follow'd it, whom 'twas neceſſary to undeceive. For to imagin that <hi>John Scot, Bertram,</hi> and <hi>Raban</hi> ſhunn'd the oppoſing him during his life, that they might not bring upon 'em ſo terrible an Adverſary, muſt proceed from th' ignorance of what theſe three great men were, who
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:41961:299"/> had another kind of eſteem amongſt the learned than <hi>Paſchaſus.</hi> 'Tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a ridiculous conjecture to imagin they lay quiet during his life, becauſe his Doctrin was then the common Doctrin of the Church, which they da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not oppoſe. For if this reaſon hindred 'em from writing againſt <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſus</hi> during his life, why did it not do the ſame after his death, ſeeing the common Doctrin of the Church was ſtill the ſame, and <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> carried it not away with him into his Grave?</p>
                        <p>BUT at bottom there's nothing more uncertain than this remark of Mr. <hi>Arnaud.</hi> For as to <hi>John Scot,</hi> there's not the leaſt reaſon to gueſs he wrote ſince <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his death. We know he wrote of the Euchariſt by the command of <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> and conſequently whilſt he was in <hi>France,</hi> whether this was before or after the year 852, 'twill be in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion hard to determin. As to <hi>Raban</hi> we cannot be certain whether this <hi>Egilon</hi> to whom he wrote his Letter againſt <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> was either <hi>Egilon</hi> Abbot of <hi>Fuldad,</hi> who died in the year 822, or another <hi>Egilon</hi> Abbot of <hi>Prom,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Marquard</hi> in the year 853. For as to what is ſaid by the anonimous Treatiſe which Father <hi>Celot</hi> publiſh'd, which is, that <hi>Raban</hi> was Archbiſhop of <hi>Mayence</hi> when he wrote this Letter, is very weak. It's true it terms him <hi>Raban</hi> of <hi>Mayence,</hi> but upon another occaſion, to wit, when the Author accuſes him to have taught, that the myſtery of the Body and Blood of our Lord is expoſed to the common condition of aliments; whereas when he mentions the Letter which he wrote againſt <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> he calls him only <hi>Raban,</hi> and hence can be nothing certain gather'd. As to <hi>Bertram,</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> alledges no other reaſon but this, <hi>That there's little</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 8. ch. 8. p. 842.</note> 
                           <hi>likelihood he would write againſt his Abbot whilſt he was under his Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and that</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>who believed his Doctrin could not be attack'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a crime, muſt have complain'd of this attempt.</hi> But is Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of what the Preſident <hi>Maugin</hi> has written touching <hi>Bertram,</hi> that he was not only a very learned but a very honeſt man; <hi>a bold defender of the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Diſſert. c. 17.</note> 
                           <hi>Catholick Faith againſt all Innovators,</hi> and that he wrote againſt <hi>Hincmar his own Biſhop, altho he was upheld by the Kings Authority.</hi> What likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is there that a man who ſcrupled not to write againſt his Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and ſuch a man as <hi>Hincmar,</hi> who was countenanced by the King, would ſtick to write by the Kings order too againſt <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> altho he was his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot.</p>
                        <p>IT ſignifies nothing for Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to ſay, <hi>That</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>clearly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies that his Doctrin was only attack'd by private Diſcourſes and not by Books.</hi> For this cannot be collected from his expreſſions, unleſs we read 'em with gloſſes and interpretations of Mr. <hi>Arnaud. Let thoſe,</hi> ſays <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> in his Commentary on the 26th. of S.<hi>Matthew, that will extenuate the term of Body, hear me; thoſe that ſay, that 'tis not the true Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt which is now celebrated in the Sacrament in the Church, and that 'tis not his true Blood, imagining they know not what, that 'tis in this Sacrament the virtue of the Fleſh and Blood, and make the Lord a lyar, ſaying, that 'tis not his true Fleſh, nor his true Blood, by which we declare his true death; whereas truth it ſelf ſays, This is my Body.</hi> And a little lower, <hi>I am aſtoniſh'd at ſome peoples ſaying 'tis not the real Fleſh and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt in the ſame thing, but that it is Sacramentally ſo, a certain virtue of his Fleſh, and not his Fleſh, the virtue of his Blood, and not his Blood, the figure and not the truth, the ſhadow, and not the Body.</hi> And in another place a little further, <hi>I ſpake of theſe things the more largely and more expreſly, becauſe I underſtand that ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reprehend
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:41961:299"/> me as if I would (in the Book which I wrote concerning the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſt) attribute to theſe words more than the truth it ſelf promiſes.</hi> And in his Letter to <hi>Frudegard, Sed quidam,</hi> ſays he, <hi>loquaciſſimi magis quam docti dum hoec credere refugiunt, quaecunque poſſunt, ne credant quoe veritas repromittit, opponunt, &amp; dicunt nullum corpus eſſe quod non ſit palpabile, &amp; viſible, hoec autem inquiunt, quia myſteria ſunt videri nequeunt, nec palpari, &amp; ideo corpus non ſunt, &amp; ſi corpus non ſunt, in figura carnis &amp; ſanguinis hoec dicuntur, &amp; non in proprietate naturoe carnis Chriſti &amp; ſanguinis, quoe caro paſſa eſt in cruce, &amp; nata de Maria Virgine. Ecce quam bene diſputant contra fidem ſine fide.</hi> It appears from theſe paſſages that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his opinion was contradicted, That he was accuſed for taking Chriſts words in a wrong ſence, That he had ſeveral clear and ſolid objections offered him, whether by word of mouth, or writing, or by Books, or bare diſcourſes, he does not inform us. But one may well conclude hence that this oppoſition conſiſted not in ſecret diſcourſes, as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would have us believe. Are we wont to call private diſcourſe a formal oppoſition by way of objection, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, cenſure, and clear and preciſe explication of the contrary opinion? <hi>Opponunt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>quoecunque poſſunt, Ecce quam bene diſputant, dicunt non in ſe eſſe veritatem carnis Chriſti vel ſanguinis, ſed in Sacramento virtutem car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis non carnem. Audivi quoſdam me reprehendere, &amp;c.</hi> Do men thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs themſelves when they would repreſent private diſcourſe? <hi>But,</hi> ſays <note place="margin">Book 3. ch. 8. p. 843.</note> Mr. <hi>Arnaud, Paſchaſus in his Letter to</hi> Frudegard, <hi>aſſures, that altho ſome are deceived thro ignorance, yet there is no body that dared openly contradict what the whole earth believes and confeſſes of this myſtery.</hi> I anſwer, that the ſenſe of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> is, that no body dared contradict openly what the whole Earth believes and confeſſes of this myſtery, to wit, that 'tis the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, according as 'tis expreſs'd in this clauſe of the Liturgy which he alledges, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t fiat Corpus &amp; Sanguis dilectiſſimi filii tui Domini niſtri Jeſu Chriſti;</hi> and by the words of Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> Now what he ſays is true in the ſenſe which we ſuppoſe muſt be given to the words of Chriſt, and to the terms of the Liturgy, but it does not hence follow that thoſe that oppoſed the ſence which <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> gave to theſe very words of the Liturgy, and to thoſe of Chriſt, explain'd themſelves very plainly againſt him, for there's a great deal of difference between acknowledging the truth of theſe words, and acknowledging the ſenſe which an Author would give 'em, They confeſſed that the words were true, and could not be queſtion'd without a crime; but yet this hindred 'em not from ſetting 'emſelves againſt the ſenſe of <hi>Paſchaſus. Paſchaſus</hi> pretends to draw advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage againſt 'em by their acknowledging the words, imagining the words were plainly for him; but he does not at all ſay they dared not to diſpute openly againſt him, nor againſt the ſenſe he gave theſe words. This is a deluſion of Mr. <hi>Arnauds,</hi> juſt as if any one having ſaid that there's no body yet amongſt the Proteſtants that has openly denied the Euchariſt to be the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would thence conclude that there's none of 'em then that has yet openly contradicted the ſenſe in which the Roman Church underſtands it, and that they explain themſelves about it only in ſecret diſcourſes. But pray why muſt theſe be ſecret diſcourſes during <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſus</hi> his life, ſeeing Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is obliged to confeſs there were after his death publick Writings which appeared againſt his Doctrin? Is not this a ſilly pretenſion which at fartheſt can only make us imagin <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> as a formidable man who held the world in awe during his life, and againſt whom no body dared open his mouth till after his death.</p>
                        <pb n="204" facs="tcp:41961:300"/>
                        <p>BUT laying aſide this imagination of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> come we to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal queſtion, to wit, whether <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> was an Innovator. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to defend him from this charge has recourſe to the Greek Church, <hi>which gives,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſuch an expreſs teſtimony to his Doctrin of the Real Preſence</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 8. ch. 9.</note> 
                           <hi>in the 7th. 8th. and 9th. Centuries, that it muſt needs ſhame thoſe who out of a raſh capricio have the boldneſs to affirm that</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>was the inventer of it.</hi> He adds, <hi>That all the principal Authors of the Latin Church of the ſame time who clearly taught it in ſuch a manner as they ought to teach it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſtate of their time, do overthrow this ridiculous Fable.</hi> To paſs by Mr. <hi>Arnauds</hi> expreſſions which are always ſtronger than his reaſons, we need only ſend him to th'examination of the Greek Authors of the 7th. 8th. and 9th. Centuries, and Latin Authors of the 7th. and 8th. for he will therein find wherewithal to ſatisfie himſelf above his deſires. Let's only ſee whether he has any thing better to offer us.</p>
                        <p>HE has recourſe next to his great common place of moral impoſſibilities, and ſuppoſing that according to us <hi>none of the Clergy, or Laity imagin'd that Jeſus Chriſt was really preſent in the Euchariſt, that they all took the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt for Bread and Wine in ſubſtance, that they knew the Bread and Wine were ſigns and Sacraments of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt by which we obtain his Graces, and that we muſt meditate on the Paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt in receiving them; that</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>very well knew that his opinion was oppoſite to that of the Church, and that he remain'd in her external Communion only out of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal motive, leſt he ſhould find himſelf too weak if he departed out of it;</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing I ſay this, he thus reaſons, <hi>Let us imagin a Religious under a Regular Diſcipline, and him ſo young that he calls himſelf a Child, and who thinks he has diſcovered this marvellous ſecret, that Jeſus Chriſt is really preſent on Earth in infinite places, that all Chriſtians receive him really every time they partake of the Euchariſt, but that by a deplorable blindneſs they are ignorant of this happineſs, do not know the Saviour whom they have often in their hands and which they receive into their mouths, and take his real Body for an image and ſimple figure; that he is the only man that knows the truth of this Myſtery, and is deſtin'd to declare it to the world. This conceit is already very ſtrange and contrary to the idea which a man neceſſarily forms on</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>from his Writings, there being nothing more remote from the humility and ſimplicity appearing in 'em than this prodigious inſolency with which Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges him, ſo that we may truly ſay he could not worſe repreſent the character of his mind.</hi> He afterwards ſays, that this enterpriſe of <hi>Paſchaſus of inſtructing all people in this new opinion was the greateſt enterprize that ever any man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook far greater than that of the Apoſtles when they determin'd to Preach the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt throughout all the world. For in fine they were twelve, they wrought Miracles, had other proofs than words, they made Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and eſtabliſh'd them Doctors of the truth which they preach'd.</hi> Paſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus <hi>had nothing of all this.</hi> He triumphantly fills five great pages with this diſcourſe.</p>
                        <p>TO anſwer this with ſomewhat leſs heat, we'l reply that theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings would have been perhaps of ſome uſe had Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> liv'd in <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſus</hi> his time, and was oblig'd to make an Oration before him in <hi>genere deliberativo</hi> to diſſuade him from making his Book publick. But who told him at preſent that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> muſt neceſſarily have all theſe things in his mind, and ſtudied 'em neither more nor leſs than Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has done in
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:41961:300"/> his Cloſet? Who told him that all thoſe who teach novelties think throly on what they do? When <hi>Arius</hi> a ſimple Prieſt of <hi>Alexandria</hi> troubled the Church, by teaching this dreadful novelty that the Son of God was but a Creature, there's no great likelihood he propoſed to himſelf at firſt the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Faith of the whole world, for inſtructing the people, and every where overthrowing what the Apoſtles had eſtabliſh'd, or compared his deſign with that of the Apoſtles, and examin'd what there was more or leſs in it? 'Tis the ſame in reference to <hi>Eutychius</hi> and other teachers of new Doctrins, their firſt thoughts were preſently to ſet forth what they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd moſt conſonant to truth, leaving the ſucceſs to time, and mannaging themſelves afterwards as occaſion required. The greateſt affairs do uſually begin after this manner, men enter upon 'em without much reflection, and afterwards drive 'em on thro all that happens unforeſeen.</p>
                        <p>2. TO diſcover the vanity of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s arguings, we need only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them to <hi>John Scot,</hi> or <hi>Bertram.</hi> Suppoſe we then as he would have us, that in their time the whole world believed firmly and univerſally the Real Preſence and Tranſubſtantiation, and all the Faithful had a diſtinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of it, knew all of 'em that the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine no longer ſubſiſts after their Conſecration, that what we receive in the Communion is the proper ſubſtance of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, the ſame numerical ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which was born of the Virgin, dead and riſen, and is now ſate at the right hand of God, that the ſame Body is in Heaven and on Earth at the ſame time. <hi>John Scot</hi> a ſimple Religious undertakes to diſabuſe all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to perſuade them that what they had hitherto taken for the proper ſubſtance of the Son of God was a ſubſtance of Bread, that thro a deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable error they had hitherto worſhip'd an object which deſerv'd not this adoration, and that henceforth by his Miniſtry and at his word all the Earth ſhould change its Faith and Worſhip. Does this deſign appear leſs ſtrange to Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> than that he imputes to <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> upon our ſuppoſition? All the difference I find is, that <hi>Scot</hi>'s enterprize would be greater and harder than that of <hi>Paſchaſus;</hi> for 'tis difficulter to root ancient and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Opinions out of mens minds, than to inſpire them with new ones; to make 'em lay aſide their Rites, Altars, th'object of their ſupreme Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Piety, than to make 'em receive new Services in reference to a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for which they have already a great reſpect. Howſoever 'tis certain that <hi>John Scot</hi> wrote a Book againſt the Real Preſence, and according to Mr <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Hypotheſis, this Book was an innovation contrary to the common Faith of his Age. A thouſand Arguments will never hinder but that according to him this is true. Why then will he have it to be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> who wrote a Book touching the Real Preſence, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance any novelty with which the Church before that time was unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Why muſt there be in Hypotheſis's which are alike facilities on the one ſide, and impoſſibilities on the other? <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> and <hi>John Scot</hi> wrote, one for the Real Preſence, and the other againſt it. This is a fact which is uncontroulable. One of 'em muſt neceſſarily have offered a new Doctrine contrary to the general belief, and conſequently one of 'em muſt be an Innovator. If it be poſſible that 'twas <hi>John Scot,</hi> it is yet more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable 'twas <hi>Paſchaſus;</hi> if it be impoſſible that 'twas <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> it is yet more impoſſible to be <hi>John Scot.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> then need not ſo warm himſelf in his conſequences, ſeeing 'tis his intereſt as well as ours to acknowledg the nullity of 'em; and we may truly affirm without doing him wrong, that never man ſpent his pains to leſs purpoſe, than he has done in this occaſion.</p>
                        <pb n="206" facs="tcp:41961:301"/>
                        <p>3. ALL that can be reaſonably ſaid of <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> is, that being yet young, and imagining the ſubſtances of Bread and Wine did not ſubſiſt in the Euchariſt, but were chang'd into the ſubſtance of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, he thought this marvail was not enough known, and that 'twas neceſſary to explain it. And therefore he undertakes to inſtruct his Diſciple <hi>Placidus</hi> in it, to whom he dedicates his Book, and the reſt of his Scholars. This appears from the reading of his Preface, and ſecond Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter. <hi>Placuit,</hi> ſays he in his Preface, <hi>ea quoe de Sacramento Sanguinis &amp; corporis tibi exigis neceſſaria, quoe tui proetexantur amore ita tenus perſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere, ut coeteri vitoe pabulum &amp; ſalutis hauſtum planius tecum caperent ad medelam, &amp; nobis operis proeſtantior exuberaret fructus mercedis pro ſudore.</hi> And in the ſecond Chapter, <hi>Tanti Sacramenti virtus inveſtiganda eſt, &amp; diſciplina Chriſti fides erudienda, ne forte ob hoc cenſeamur indigni ſi non ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis diſcernimus illud, nec intelligimus myſticum Chriſti Corpus &amp; ſanguis quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta polleat dignitate quantaque proemineat virtute—ideo timendum ne per ignorantiam quod nobis proviſum eſt ad medelam fiat accipientibus in ruinam.</hi> There cannot be gathered any more than this touching the firſt deſign of <hi>Paſchaſus.</hi> His deſigns without doubt extended not ſo far as the whole Univerſe, they only reſpected <hi>Placidus</hi> and ſome other Scholars which he taught, and the end he propoſed was to give 'em the knowledg of this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery which he had obtain'd, believing 'twas not ſufficiently known. His Book which was deſign'd only for young people was yet read by many others, it excited the curioſity of ſeveral, as he himſelf tells us in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Frudegard, Ad intelligentiam,</hi> ſays he, <hi>hujus myſterii plures ut audio commovi: I have ſtirred up ſeveral people to underſtand this myſtery.</hi> 'Tis likely ſeveral became of his mind, and 'tis certain others condemned his opinion: <hi>Audivi,</hi> ſays he, <hi>quoſdam me reprehendere,</hi> and that others in fine remain'd in ſuſpenſe and uncertainty. <hi>Quoeris,</hi> ſays he, to <hi>Frudegard, de re ex qua multi dubitant,</hi> and lower, <hi>Multi ex hoc dubitant quomodo ille inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger manet, &amp; hoc, Corpus Chriſti &amp; Sanguis eſſe poſſit.</hi> This firſt ſucceſs ſo little advantageous obliged him to write his Commentary on the 26th. of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> where he urges the words of Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and argues as ſtrongly as he can againſt thoſe that ſay 'tis the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in a Figure, in a Sacrament, and in Virtue. In fine, <hi>Frudegard</hi> having offered him a paſſage of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> out of his third Book, <hi>De Doctrina Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiana,</hi> wherein this Father ſays, that to eat this Fleſh and drink this Blood is a figurative locution, which ſeems to command a ſin, but which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to meditate on the Death and Paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt for us, he thence takes occaſion to write the Letter to <hi>Frudegard,</hi> wherein he endeavours by all means to defend his Doctrin, preſſing again the words of Jeſus Chriſt, and relating ſome paſſages of the Fathers, and Liturgy which he imagin'd were on his ſide, And this is all that can be ſaid hiſtorically touching <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſus</hi> his fact, in which I think there's nothing that hinders us from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving he was an Innovator, that is to ſay, that the Doctrin he offered was not that of the Church, as will be made plain by what we ſhall alledg anon. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſhould argue from theſe matters of fact, and not from imaginary ſuppoſitions.</p>

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:41961:301"/> he muſt ſuppoſe the world.</hi> Altho he does not ſpeak of it, what can be thence concluded, thoſe that propoſe novelties as the perpetual Faith of the Church are cautious of abſolutely acknowledging that in this reſpect the world lies in an error. Yet does <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> inſinuate in his Book that this myſtery was unknown, that is to ſay, that men knew not yet his Doctrin, as I have already ſhew'd, and in his Letter to <hi>Frudegard</hi> he formally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that ſeveral were ignorant of it. <hi>Quamvis,</hi> ſays he, <hi>plurimi ignora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verint tanti myſterii Sacramenta. He does not trouble himſelf,</hi> adds Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud, to confirm what he ſays by proofs ſufficient to diſſipate this error.</hi> What follows hence? He proves it as well as he can, that is to ſay ill; yet does he advertiſe his <hi>Placidus</hi> in his Preface that he took what he offer'd out of the principal Authors of the Church, and he names S. <hi>Cyprian, Ambroſe, Hilary, Auguſtin, Chryſoſtom, Jerom, Gregory, Iſidor, Iſychius</hi> and <hi>Bede:</hi> Now here are, I think, great names enough.</p>

                           <hi>having taught in a Book a Doctrin unheard of contrary to ſenſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and having taught it without proofs, living in a great communalty, having commerce with a great number of Religious, Abbots, and Biſhops, was yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed by none of 'em that he offered an error contrary to the Doctrin of the Church, and that not only he eſcap'd unpuniſh'd, but for thirty years together no body teſtifi'd any aſtoniſhment at his Doctrin; ſo that he only learn'd from other peoples report, and that thirty years after he wrote his Book that there were ſome perſons who found fault with it.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s prejudice puts him upon ſtrange things. Does he not ſee we need only turn his reaſoning on <hi>John Scot</hi> and <hi>Bertram</hi> to expoſe the weakneſs of it? They wrote againſt the Real Preſence: who told them they offer'd an error contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the Church? who puniſh'd 'em for it? what Popes, what Councils condemn'd 'em? who, ſetting aſide <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> ſtood up againſt thoſe that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd the Euchariſt was not the Body of Jeſus Chriſt otherwiſe than Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally, figuratively, and virtually, and not really, <hi>Non in re eſſe veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem carnis Chriſti vel Sanguinis, ſed in Sacramento, virtutem quandam carnis &amp; non carnem, virtutem Sanguinis &amp; non Sanguinem?</hi> Suppoſing no body did addreſs themſelves to <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> himſelf to charge him with the publiſhing in his Book a new Doctrin, what can be rationally inferred hence, but that his Book was at firſt but little known by learned men who were fit to judg of it, becauſe a Book deſign'd for Scholars does not uſually make any great noiſe, or becauſe perhaps that it was deſpiſed, ſeeing that in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect there was little in it to the purpoſe. <hi>But,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud, at leaſt the Monks of the Convent of</hi> Corbie <hi>muſt oppoſe him,</hi> Had they done it, they had done no more than they ought. But <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> was their Maſter that taught 'em, and the Diſciples are not wont to contradict their Maſters. <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> had immediately won to his intereſts <hi>Placidus,</hi> who was a perſon of Quality and a Dignitary in this Convent, as appears by the terms of <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſus</hi> himſelf, for thus does he beſpeak him. <hi>Dilectiſſimo filio, &amp; vice Chriſti proeſidenti, Magiſtro Monaſticae Diſciplinoe, alternis ſucceſſibus veritatis diſcipulo.</hi> Again, who told Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> that no body for thirty years re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> to his face? how knows he this, that he can be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of it? Does <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> himſelf poſitively aſſure him of it? No. But 'tis becauſe <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> ſays, <hi>Audivi quoſdam me reprehendere. I am inform'd that ſome blame me.</hi> Every man ſees that this expreſſion is not ſufficient for the drawing of this conſequence, and that an Author may ſpeak thus, altho he was told of his fault to his face. In fine, who inform'd Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi>
                           <pb n="208" facs="tcp:41961:302"/> that the contradictions which <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> met with did not happen till thirty years after the publiſhing of his Book? Becauſe he complains of this in his Commentaries on S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> which were publiſh'd not till thirty years after. A frivolous reaſon, as if the cenſures which were made of his Doctrin, muſt needs be of the ſame date as his Commentaries wherein he mentions 'em, and endeavours to defend himſelf. It muſt be acknowledg'd that never man argued more unhappily than Mr. <hi>Arnaud.</hi>

                           <hi>Friends, and Brethren, but he ſtill believed the whole Church was on his ſide. For in his Papers which he wrote not long before his death he preſſes his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known adverſaries of whom he had notice, by the Authority of the whole Church, and clearly affirms a man cannot oppoſe his Opinion without contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Faith of it. Videat qui contra hoc venire voluerit magis quam credere quid agat contra ipſum Dominum, &amp; contra omnem Eccleſiam. He ſays that no body dared yet openly contradict this Doctrin which he taught, nor oppoſe what the whole world own'd to be true. Ideo quamvis quidam de ignorantia errent, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo tamen adhuc eſt in aperto qui ita hoc eſſe contradicat quod totus orbis credit &amp; confitetur. In ſhort he accuſes thoſe as highly criminal, who uſing the common Prayers of the Church explain'd them in a ſenſe of figure and virtue, contrary to the conſent of the whole Earth. Nefandum ergo ſcelus eſt orare cum omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, &amp; non credere quod ipſa veritas teſtatur, &amp; ubique omnes univerſaliter ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum eſſe fatentur.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I anſwered the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity, That</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>did not ſay the whole world was formally of his opinion, but that this was a conſequence which he would draw from the whole worlds believing to be true and above all queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the words of Jeſus Chriſt, This is my Body, which he imagin'd contain'd his Belief, and from the Churches ſaying in her Canon, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t fiat Corpus &amp; Sanguis dilectiſſimi filii tui Domini noſtri Jeſu Chriſti, to which the people anſwered, Amen. That there's a great deal of difference betwixt poſitive aſſuring that the whole Church believes by a diſtinct and unqueſtionable Faith a Doctrin, and th' iutroducing of it by conſequences drawn from ſome expreſſions which a man believes to be favorable to this Doctrin, but which are not ſo greatly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable but that they may be of uſe to thoſe who believe a contrary Doctrin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>HERE,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud, is a diſtinction well worthy of Mr.</hi> Claude'<hi>s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention who admirably well pretends to anſwer a matter when he does nothing leſs, and to diſtinguiſh by terms which have no ſenſe, that which reaſon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſtinguiſh.</hi> Let us in good time ſee then whether my diſtinction be as extravagant as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would make it. When a man maintains againſt an opponent a Doctrin which is ſaid to be the common Doctrin of the Church, either this propoſition <hi>that 'tis the common Doctrin of the Church,</hi> is ſo clear and evident, that the Adverſaries themſelves muſt grant it, or it is not ſo clear nor evident but that 'tis queſtionable. As to the firſt caſe, a man need not trouble himſelf to prove it: for its taken for a Principle, and ſuch conſequences are thence drawn as are judged fitting. For inſtance, When the Gentlemen of the Roman Church teach that our Saviour Chriſt died not only for the Elect, but alſo for all men in general; that all Gods Commands are poſſible to be kept by the Juſt, according to the preſent condition of their ability; that the ſubſtance of Bread is really converted into the ſubſtance of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; that the Wicked receive the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and eat it with their bodily mouths in the act of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:41961:302"/> the Communion; it is ſo evident that theſe are the common Doctrins of this Church, that there needs no proving 'em; and ſhould any one in the boſom of the Roman Church oppoſe theſe Articles, there's no body would take pains to prove to him that they are the Faith of the Church, for they would be ſuppoſed to be undeniable Principles, and he would have only hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences drawn againſt him. As to the ſecond caſe, that is to ſay when 'tis not clear that this is the Faith of the Church, and that this point is in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, both parties apply themſelves to the bringing of proofs, and each commonly endeavours to authoriſe his Opinion under the ſpecious name of the Faith of the Church.</p>
                        <p>BUT as this queſtion touching the common Doctrin of the Church may have two ſenſes, one which regards preciſely the preſent Church, which is to ſay, the Church in the time of the conteſt, the other which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the Church in the preceding times, which is to ſay, before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, it may alſo receive two ſorts of proofs, ſome which refer to the preſent time, others which refer to the Ages which have preceded us. When a man proves for the time preſent, he alledges teſtimonies of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Church, when he proves for the paſt time, he alledges 'em of thoſe that have lived before us, and the queſtion determins it ſelf according as the proofs are good, or bad, concluſive, or not concluſive.</p>
                        <p>TO apply this to the matter in hand, I ſay, That <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd for an undeniable Principle, that his Doctrin was the Doctrin or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon belief of the Church in his time; on the contrary he has formally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd that there were in his time three ſorts of perſons in the Church; the firſt reprehended him for miſ-underſtanding the words of Chriſt. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divi quoſdam me reprehendere quaſi ego in eo libro quem de Sacramentis Chriſti edideram aliquid his dictis plus tribuere voluerim quam ipſa veritas repromit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit,</hi> and affirm'd on the contrary that the Euchariſt was the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in figure and virtue. <hi>Non in re eſſe veritatem carnis Chriſti vel San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainis, ſed in Sacramento, virtutem quandam carnis &amp; non carnem.</hi> Others that doubted of the truth of his Doctrin, <hi>multi dubitant,</hi> ſays he, ſeveral times. And in fine, others that erred thro ignorance, which is to ſay, that had not yet heard of theſe marvails which he propoſed. <hi>Quamvis plurimi,</hi> ſays he, <hi>dubitaverint vel ignoraverint tanti myſterii Sacramenta.</hi> And a little lower, <hi>Quamvis ex hoc quidam de ignorantia errent.</hi> He was then far from vaunting that his Doctrin was undeniably the common Faith of the Church of his Age.</p>
                        <p>I ſay in the ſecond place, that whatſoever deſign <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> had to make people believe that he taught nothing but what was according to the Doctrin of the Church; yet did he never alledg for this effect the men of his time, nor ever ſaid the Biſhops which then governed the Churches, the Abbots, Prieſts, Religious, and all learned men held the ſame language as he did, and all of 'em unanimouſly confeſs'd, that the ſubſtance of Bread was changed into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt born of the Virgin according to the propriety of his nature. Neither did he ever aver he held his Doctrin from Maſters that taught it. <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> was far from aſſerting this.</p>
                        <p>HE keeps to three things, to ſome paſſages of the Fathers, to the words of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> to a clauſe of the Liturgy, which ſays, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t fiat Corpus &amp; ſanguis dilectiſſimi filii tui Domini noſtri Jeſu Chriſti:</hi> And
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:41961:303"/> as to the paſſages of the Fathers having propoſed 'em, he concludes, <hi>That from thence one may know that what he wrote was not an effect of Enthuſiaſtical raſhneſs, nor a young man's viſion; but that he offered theſe things (to thoſe who were deſirous of 'em) from the authority of the Word of God, and the Writings of the Holy Fathers. Now ſeeing,</hi> adds he, <hi>it appears that all men have not Faith, yet if they cannot underſtand, let 'em learn to believe with the Fathers that there's nothing impoſſible with God, and acquieſce in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine words without the leaſt doubt of 'em. For we never as yet read any have erred in this point, unleſs thoſe that have erred touching the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, altho ſeveral have doubted, or been ignorant of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſo great a myſtery.</hi> Is this the language of a man that loudly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the conſent of the whole Church? Were he aſſur'd he wrote nothing but what was according to the common belief, what need he juſtifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the ſuſpicion of Enthuſiaſm and pretences to Viſions? Are we wont to ſuſpect people in this ſort who ſay only what the whole world ſays and believes? And deſigning to juſtifie himſelf, why muſt he rather betake himſelf to ſome paſſages of the Fathers, (whoſe ſenſe and terms he may juſtly be ſaid to have corrupted) than to the teſtimony of perſons in his own time, and to ſay if he was an Enthuſiaſt or Viſionary, all the Biſhops, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots, Prieſts, Religious, Doctors, and Chriſtians in general were ſo too, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they all believ'd and ſpake as he did? But inſtead of this he complains that his Doctrin which he term'd that of the Fathers was not kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: <hi>Nunc autem,</hi> ſays he, <hi>exinde quia claruit quod non omnium eſt fides.</hi> He exhorts thoſe who reprehended him, to believe with the Fathers that nothing is impoſſible with God, and to acquieſce in the words of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Diſcant quoeſo cum talibus credere, ſi adhuc nequeunt intelligere, quod Deo nihil eſt impoſſibile, diſcant &amp; verbis divinis acquieſcere, &amp; in nullo de his dubitare.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>WHEN then he adds that hitherto 'twas not heard that any perſon er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on this ſubject, unleſs 'twere thoſe who had erred touching Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. <hi>Quia uſque ad proeſens nemo deerraſſe legitur niſi qui &amp; de Chriſto er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raverunt.</hi> He would ſay that till then no body had contradicted the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the Fathers, leaving it to be underſtood that then 'twas contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, becauſe they contradicted his, which he maintain'd was that of the Fathers. So far we do not find him boaſting of the conſent of the Church in his time, for we ſee on the contrary ſeveral things which ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note that he was far from doing it.</p>
                        <p>AS to the paſſages of the Liturgy, and words of Chriſt, he ſays, that the Prieſt prays in the Canon in theſe terms, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t fiat Corpus Jeſus Chriſti, that all the People cry Amen, and ſo the whole Church in every Nation and Language confeſſes that 'tis this ſhe deſires in her Prayer.</hi> Whence he draws this conſequence, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde videat qui contra hoc venire voluerit magis quam credere quid agat contra ipſum Dominum &amp; contra omnem Chriſti Eccleſiam. Nefarium ergo ſcelus eſt orare cum omnibus, &amp; non credere quod ipſa veritas teſtatur, &amp; ubique omnes nniverſaliter verum eſſe fatentur. Let thoſe then that had rather contradict this than believe it, conſider what they do againſt the Lord himſelf and his whole Church. It is then a great fault to pray with all people, and not to believe what the truth it ſelf atteſts, and what all do univerſally, and every where confeſs to be true.</hi> His Argument is a Sophiſm which amounts to this, <hi>Our Saviour Chriſt ſays 'tis his Body, and the whole Church confeſſes the ſame. But they that at this day deny that 'tis his Body</hi>
                           <pb n="211" facs="tcp:41961:303"/> 
                           <hi>in propriety of nature deny that 'tis his Body. Therefore they contradict Jeſus Chriſt and his Church.</hi> Who ſees not but there is a great difference between reaſoning in this manner, and poſitively aſſuring, that the whole Church believes 'tis his Body in propriety of nature? <hi>I will have this,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Page 852.</note> 
                           <hi>to be only a conſequence. Are not Authors perſuaded of the truth of the conſequences which they draw, and do they not offer them for true as poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as their principles?</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> gives an exchange. The queſtion is not whether <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> was perſuaded of the ſolidity of his conſequence or not, but whether we ought to be perſuaded of it our ſelves, and take it for a teſtimony touching the publick belief of his time. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſhould know that when a man teſtifies of a matter of fact, and afterwards draws thence by way of argument, and conſequence another fact, he is no farther cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible in reſpect of this latter, but only as his argument or conſequence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears juſt to us. If I ſay for example that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> confeſſes in the firſt edition of his Book, <hi>That 'tis poſſible the faithful knew not always ſo expreſly,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 6. ch. 1.</note> 
                           <hi>and univerſally, whether the Bread did or did remain in the Sacrament,</hi> and I from hence draw by way of argument and conſequence this propoſition, <hi>That Mr.</hi> Arnaud <hi>acknowledges Tranſubſtantiation was not anciently an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith in the Church.</hi> My teſtimony in reſpect of the latter fact will be no farther credible than my conſequence will be good. 'Tis the ſame here. <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> aſſures us, that the whole Church in his time called the Euchariſt the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, ſaying theſe words, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t fiat Corpus dilectiſſimi filii tui.</hi> So far he acts as a witneſs, we muſt believe him. Whence he draws this conſequence. That thoſe that do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it to be the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in propriety of nature, but only in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament contradict the Church. Here he acts the part of a Diſputer, if his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing be good, we will believe him, if it be a Sophiſm, we'll not matter it. Now 'tis a ſophiſm; for according to the maxim of S. <hi>Auguſtin, The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments aſſume the names of the things of which they are Sacraments,</hi> ſo that to deny the Euchariſt to be the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in propriety of nature, it does not follow a man thereby contradicts the Church which calls it the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T,</hi> adds Mr. <hi>Arnaud, 'tis moreover falſe that this is only a conſequence.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 8. ch. 9. p. 852.</note> 
                           <hi>For this propoſition that the whole Church believ'd the Real Preſence was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded both in the Principle and Concluſion of</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>his argument. He concludes, That thoſe who deny the Real Preſence commit an horrid crime in oppoſing the Faith of the Church. Here we have it comprehended in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</hi> Did ever man hear ſuch kind of reaſoning? 'Tis falſe that this is only a conſequence, becauſe 'tis a propoſition contain'd in the concluſion. This is juſt as if a man ſhould ſay 'tis falſe that it is day. Why? Becauſe the Sun is at his heighth, for for to be day, and the Sun to be at its heighth, are not more the ſame thing, than to be a conſequence, and to be a propoſition contained in the concluſion of an argument. Are theſe the prodigious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Logick? <hi>And the Principle of this concluſion is,</hi> adds he, <hi>not that the Church ſimply recites theſe words; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t fiat Corpus dilectiſſimi filii tui, but underſtands them in the ſenſe of the Real Preſence.</hi> Which is what I deny. The Principle whereon <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> argues is no other than this, That the Prieſt ſays, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t fiat Corpus dilectiſſimi filii tui, and the People an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Amen.</hi> That the Church did, or did not underſtand this of the Real Preſence, is what <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> does not touch on. He is careful not to advance ſo far, <hi>Had he known,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud, that the Church took theſe words in another ſenſe, he muſt needs be a mad man to reproach as he does theſe perſons</hi>
                           <pb n="212" facs="tcp:41961:304"/> 
                           <hi>for being contrary to the ſenſe of the whole Church. He ſuppoſes then this for a Princile, that the whole Church took them in the ſence of a Real Preſence, and conſequently ſuppoſes ſhe held entirely this Doctrin.</hi> This is mere wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> does not ſay that theſe perſons againſt whom he inveighs were contrary to the ſenſe of the Church, but only, <hi>that they went againſt the Church,</hi> to wit, inaſmuch as they went, according to him, contrary to the terms of the Liturgy. Secondly, Whether he did or did not know that the Church took theſe terms in another ſenſe, 'tis not neceſſary to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, ſeeing he does not explain himſelf therein, and ſpeaks neither far or near of the ſenſe of theſe terms. And 'tis likely he knew there were at leaſt three ſorts of perſons in the Church, the doubters, the ignorant, and formal adverſaries of his Doctrin who took 'em not in this ſenſe. Thirdly, Suppoſing we ſay not that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> was mad, but argued like a Sophiſter, what inconvenience will follow, and what ſhall we ſay more than appears from the bare reading of his diſcourſe? He would have the Church on his ſide, what could be more eaſie, ſuppoſing at that time the converſion of ſubſtances, and Real Preſence were believed, than to proclaim clearly and plainly that the whole Church, Biſhops, Religious, the Doctors, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all the faithful believed his Doctrin neither more nor leſs, and there only needed them to be conſulted. Articles of Faith of this nature cannot lie hid in a Church which holds them. His Adverſaries could not have denied this truth, and had they the impudence to do it they might eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd by a million of perſons then living. Why had he recourſe to arguing and conſequences? Why muſt this conſequence be drawn by the hair out of a paſſage of the Liturgy, which may receive I know not how many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications? Why did he not at leaſt ſay 'twas certain the Church under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood this clauſe in the ſenſe of a Real Preſence? Wherefore was he ſilent touching the ſenſe, and argued only from the force of theſe terms, <hi>Corpus dilectiſſimi filii tui,</hi> &amp;c. as if all thoſe that utter theſe terms, or add to em their <hi>Amen,</hi> believ'd the Real Preſence? Which ſhews us two things, the firſt, that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> acted like a Sophiſter, ſheltering himſelf as well as he could under the Authority of the Church, againſt the reproach objected againſt him of being a Viſionary, and an Enthuſiaſt; and the other, that in effect he was an Innovator that had broached a Doctrin unknown to the Church of his time; for had he the advantage which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes he had, which is, that the whole Church was of his opinion, and the people commonly believed the Real Preſence and converſion of ſubſtances of Bread and Wine, he would not have fail'd to make the beſt of it, and o'rewhelm his adverſaries with it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D</hi> will now then perhaps comprehend that there's a difference between a man that affirms a thing for certain, and of which he himſelf is a witneſs, and one that draws a conſequence, and perhaps will no longer ſay, <hi>That my diſtinction ſeparates by terms which have no ſenſe, that which reaſon cannot ſeparate.</hi> And at the ſame time acknowledg, that never pretenſion was worſe grounded than that of the Author of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity,</hi> and his own. They affirm the whole Church was of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his mind. But whereon do they ground their ſuppoſition? Were the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> agreed about it? No. Does <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> himſelf expreſly affirm it? No. But 'tis becauſe <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> inſinuates it by an equivocal term which the Church made uſe of.

                           <hi>THESE words of</hi> Paſchaſus, ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud, Miror quid volunt qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam nunc dicere non in re eſſe veritatem carnis Chriſti vel Sanguinis, ſed in Sacramento, virtutem quandam carnis &amp; non carnem, furniſh us with another proof of the ſame nature. For they ſhew that this ſolution of virtue was new, and that</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>had not learn'd it but of late.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does well to advertiſe us that 'tis a proof of the ſame nature as the others, for 'tis ſo in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that is to ſay, a very ſlight one, and ſcarcely worth offering. <hi>Paſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> is aſtoniſh'd at what his Adverſaries ſay in reference to virtue, not that this ſolution appears to him new. He ſays nothing of it in this reſpect, but becauſe it does not appear to him conformable to theſe words of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> nor to theſe others, <hi>The Bread which I ſhall give is my Fleſh,</hi> nor to theſe, <hi>He that eats my Fleſh, and drinks my Blood, dwells in me, and I in him.</hi> Let but Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> read <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Text, and he'l find what I ſay to be true. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>did not ſay, this is, or in this myſtery is the virtue or figure of my Body, but he has ſaid without feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, This is my Body.</hi> S. John <hi>introduces likewiſe our Lord, ſaying, the Bread which I ſhall give is my Fleſh, not another than that which is for the life of the world.</hi> And again, <hi>He that eats my Fleſh, and drinks my Blood, dwells in me and I in him. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde miror,</hi> adds he, <hi>quid velint, &amp;c,</hi> What can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded hence for the novelty of this ſolution of virtue?</p>

But who knows not that in theſe kind of diſcourſes the Particle <hi>Et,</hi> is very often a Particle which explains, or gives the reaſon of what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid, and not that which diſtinguiſhes, as I have already obſerv'd in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place. He would only ſay that before he thus believed it, having ſo read it in <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Book. And that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s ſubtilty might take place, he muſt have ſaid, not that he had thus believ'd it <hi>before;</hi> but thus believ'd it <hi>from the beginning, in his youth,</hi> that he afterwards thus found it in <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Book, who had confirm'd him in his belief, but that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he had found in S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> that 'twas a figurative locution. In this manner he had diſtinguiſh'd the three terms of Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> whereas he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes but two, <hi>antea,</hi> and <hi>poſtea,</hi> and as to the firſt, he ſays he had thus believ'd it, and thus read it in <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Book, denoting by this ſecond clauſe the place where he drew this Faith.</p>
                        <p>AND theſe are Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s objections, but having examin'd them, 'twill not be amiſs to repreſent the concluſion he draws from 'em. <hi>I do not believe,</hi> ſays he; <hi>that having conſidered all theſe proofs ſeriouſly one can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,

                        </argument>
                        <p>I SAID in the preceding Chapter that the beſt way to be informed whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> has been an Innovator, was to ſearch whether thoſe that went before him, and wrote on the ſame ſubject, have, or have not taught the ſame thing as he has done, I repeat it here, to the end it may be conſidered whether after the diſcuſſion which Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi> has made of the Doctrin of the Ancients, and what I have wrote alſo thereupon either to the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> or Father <hi>Noüet,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> we have not right to ſuppoſe, and to ſuppoſe as we do with confidence, that no body before <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> taught the converſion of the ſubſtances of Bread and Wine, or ſubſtantial Preſence of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt. Whence it follows he was the firſt that brought this new Doctrin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world.</p>
                        <p>BUT beſides this proof which is an eſſential and fundamental one, we ſhall offer ſeveral others, taken from the circumſtances of this Hiſtory which do much illuſtrate this truth. The firſt of this rank is taken from <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> himſelf's acknowledging he moved ſeveral perſons to underſtand this myſtery. <hi>Altho I wrote nothing worth the Reader's peruſal in my Book</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Frud.</note> 
                           <hi>which I dedicated cuilibet puero</hi> (I had rendred theſe words <hi>to a young man,</hi> becauſe that in effect his Book was dedicated to <hi>Placidus.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would have it rendred <hi>to young people,</hi> this is no great matter) <hi>yet am I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd that I have excited ſeveral perſons to underſtand this myſtery.</hi> Now this ſhews that before his Book came forth his Doctrin was unknown, whereunto we may alſo add the paſſages wherein he declares how the Church was ignorant of this myſtery, as we have already obſerv'd.</p>
                        <p>TO judg rightly of the ſtrength of this proof, and to defend it againſt Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s vain objections we ſhould firſt ſhew what kind of <hi>ignorance,</hi> and <hi>intelligence Paſchaſus</hi> here means. For Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has wonderful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions on this ſubject. <hi>Ought not Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>to know,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides</hi>

                           <hi>this knowledg common to all Chriſtians which makes 'em believe the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries without much reflection, there is another clearer one, and which is often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted in S.</hi> Auſtin <hi>by the word intelligence, which does not precede, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Faith, as being the fruit and recompence of it, ſic accipite, ſic credite,</hi>
                           <pb n="215" facs="tcp:41961:305"/> 
                           <hi>ſays this Father, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t mereamini intelligere, fides enim debet proecedere intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum ut ſit intellectus fidei proemium. As then all Chriſtians believe the myſteries, they believed likewiſe all of 'em the Euchariſt in</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>his time in the ſame manner as we believe it,</hi> (which is to ſay that they all believ'd the Real Preſence and Tranſubſtantiation) <hi>but they had not all of 'em an underſtanding of it, that is to ſay, they had not all conſidered this adorable Sacrament, with the application which it deſerves, That they did not all know the myſteries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the ſymbols, the relations of the Euchariſt with the Sacraments of the ancient Law, the ends which God had in appointing them, thoſe that have right to partake of 'em, the diſpoſitions with which a man ought to approach to 'em, the greatneſs of their crime who profane the Lords Body, and the reſt of thoſe things which are explained in</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>his Book. All this is contained under the word intelligence, and he comprehends it therein himſelf in explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards what he means by this term, and by making an abridgment of his whole Book without marking in particular the Real Preſence.</hi> The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion then is, whether in <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his ſenſe <hi>the ignorance,</hi> and conſequently <hi>the intelligence</hi> he ſpeaks of do not extend as far as the Real Preſence. Now this is what will be ſoon decided if we examin the paſſages themſelves of this Author without ſuffering our ſelves to be blinded by Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions. At the entrance of his ſecond Chapter, wherein he declares his deſign to diſſipate this ignorance, and remedy the evils it cauſed, he deſcribes it in this manner, <hi>Sacramentum Dominici Corporis &amp; Sanguinis quod quotidie in Eccleſia celebratur, nemo ſidelium ignorare debet, nemo neſcire quid ad fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, quidve ad ſcientiam in eo pertineat.</hi> Will you then know what kind of ignorance this was, <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> tells you immediately, <hi>Neſcire quid ad fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Paſchaſ. de Corp. &amp; Sang. Dom. cap. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>quidve ad ſcientiam pertineat.</hi> Here are preciſely the two parts of Mr, <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s diſtinction contained in the definition which <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> gives of it. For <hi>neſcire quid ad fidem pertineat,</hi> is not to have this knowledg which makes me believe the myſteries without much reflection, and <hi>neſcire quid ad ſcientiam,</hi> is not to have this other clearer knowledg which Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> calls particularly <hi>intelligence.</hi> So that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> and his Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator are not at all agreed. <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> extends the ignorance he ſpeaks of to the things which relate to Faith, which is to ſay, according to him, the Real Preſence, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> reſtrains it to other things. But let us hear <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> further, <hi>Fides,</hi> ſays he, <hi>eſt erudienda ne forte ob hoc cenſeamur in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digni, ſi non ſatis diſcernimus illud; nec intelligimus myſticum Chriſti Corpus &amp; ſanguis quanta polleat dignitate quantaque proemineat virtute. We muſt inſtruct our Faith, leſt for want of doing it we be reputed unworthy in not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently diſcerning this Sacrament, and underſtanding the excellent virtue and dignity of it.</hi> Can any man explain himſelf more clearly? The ignorance conſiſts in not well underſtanding the great dignity of the myſtical Body of Jeſus Chriſt, which in his ſenſe ſignifies not to know, that 'tis the proper ſubſtance of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt born of the Virgin, and <hi>th' intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> on the contrary conſiſts in knowing it. But to take away from Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> all pretence of the validity of his diſtinction, obſerve here what <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> adds afterwards. <hi>He receives the Sacrament ignorantly who is wholly ignorant of its virtue and dignity, and knows not the circumſtance of it, and does not truly know that 'tis the Body and Blood of our Lord, according to truth, altho it be taken in the Sacrament by Faith.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that in the ſtile of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> to be <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to truth,</hi> is to be it ſubſtantially and really. Now the <hi>ignorance</hi> conſiſts in the not knowing this, and by the reaſon of contraries the <hi>intelligence</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in knowing it according to <hi>Paſchaſus.</hi>

                        <pb n="216" facs="tcp:41961:306"/>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D</hi> will ſay without doubt that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> in all this whole ſecond Chapter, intended only to ſhew the neceſſity there is of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing perſons before they come to receive the Communion, but that he does not ſuppoſe this ignorance was actually in the Church; and that on the contrary, this neceſſity of inſtruction, in the manner which he exaggerates, denotes that they took a great care in thoſe days to teach the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants the Doctrin of the Real Preſence. But this evaſion will not ſerve turn. For beſides that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> ſays expreſly, <hi>That he receives the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ignorantly that knows not 'tis the Body and Blood of our Lord according to truth;</hi> which is an expreſſion of a man which acknowledges there are actually perſons that thus receive the Sacrament: Beſides this a man needs only read the paſſages of his Letter to <hi>Frudegard,</hi> where it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied but he ſpeaks of ignorant perſons which were then actually in the Church; I ſay, there needs no more than the reading 'em to find he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands this ſame ignorance which he had deſcrib'd in the ſecond Chapter of his Book. For having immediately propoſed, as from the part of <hi>Frudegard,</hi> the objection taken from a paſſage of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> That the Sacrament is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt by a figurative locution, <hi>Quod tropica locutio ſit ut Corpus Chriſti &amp; Sanguis eſſe dicatur,</hi> which reſpects as <note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Frud.</note> every one ſees the Article of the Real Preſence; and having endeavoured to ſatisfie it, he paſſes over to another objection, which reſpects the ſame Real Preſence. <hi>Multi,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ex hoc dubitant quomodo ille integer manet, &amp; hoc Corpus Chriſti &amp; Sanguis eſſe poſſit. Several doubt becauſe they cannot comprehend how Jeſus Chriſt remains entire, and yet the Sacrament to be his Body and Blood.</hi> He anſwers this Objection as well as he can, then imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately adds, <hi>Here you have, dear Brother, what came into my thoughts at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and becauſe you are one part of my ſelf, I believe I ought not to conceal any thing from you, altho I cannot expreſs my mind in this particular as 'tis neceſſary. As to your ſelf, I deſire you would read over again my Book touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this matter, which you ſay you have heretofore read, and if you find there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any thing reprehenſible or doubtful, refuſe not the labor of reading it again. For altho I have not written any thing worth the Readers pains in a Book which I dedicated to young people, yet am I inform'd that I have ſtirred up ſeveral perſons to the underſtanding of this myſtery.</hi> Who ſees not that in all this his whole ſcope is the Real Preſence. His whole preceding diſpute was on this Article, and theſe terms, <hi>If you find in my Book any thing reprehenſible or doubtful,</hi> can only relate to the ſame Article, for there was no queſtion of any thing elſe. When then he adds, <hi>That he has ſtirr'd up ſeveral perſons to the underſtanding of this myſtery,</hi> 'tis clear that he has reſpect to the ſame thing, and means he has reſcued ſeveral from th' ignorance wherein they lay touching the Doctrin of the Real Preſence.</p>
                        <p>BUT to leave no room for contradiction and cavil, I need only repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent what he writes towards the end of this ſame Letter, where having ſaid he has confirm'd his Doctrin by the teſtimonies of Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> the Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> S. <hi>Jerom</hi> and ſome others, he adds, <hi>Et ideo quamvis ex hoc quidam de ignorantia errent nemo tamen eſt, &amp;c. Altho ſome do err thro ignorance in this point.</hi> What can be ſaid to this? Here we have formally an actual ignorance on the Article of the Real Preſence, on the ſame Article which was diſputed him by his Adverſaries, on the ſame Article on which he produc'd the words of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and the clauſe of the Liturgy, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t fiat Corpus &amp; Sanguis, dilectiſſimi filii tui Domini noſtri</hi>

                           <hi>Jeſu Chriſti,</hi> on the ſame Article whereon he had alledged ſeveral paſſages of the Fathers, <hi>Quamvis,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ex hoc quidam de ignorantia errent.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>DOES any man deſire another expreſs and formal teſtimony of <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſus,</hi> I need only produce theſe words of his Commentary on the 26th. of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> to ſatisfie him. <hi>I have been more large on this ſubject of our Lords Supper than the brevity of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                              </gap> Commentary permits, becauſe there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral that have another ſentiment touching theſe myſtical things, and ſeveral are ſo blind as to think the Bread and Wine are nothing elſe but what we ſee with our eyes, and taſt with our mouths.</hi> Here we have then actually perſons that did not believe the Real Preſence, and thoſe not inconſiderable for their number, ſeeing he denotes them by the term of ſeveral, and which he expreſſes ſo clearly that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will be at a loſs what to anſwer.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D</hi> who well perceived he might be oppoſed on the firſt anſwer, bethought himſelf of giving us another, in which, contrary to his uſual manner, he relaxes ſomething of what he advanced. <hi>Not but that,</hi> ſays <note place="margin">Book 8. ch. 10. p. 852.</note> he, this word <hi>intelligence may likewiſe reſpect the Real Preſence, not as a new truth, but as a truth which might be fuller comprehended, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which penetrates more lively the heart, for there are ſeveral degrees of growing in the knowledg of a myſtery which one believes already by Faith.</hi> He would ſay there might be people who knew leſs ſtrongly, and livelily the Real Preſence, and that in this reſpect they might acquire the intelligence of it, but that there were none that were wholly ignorant of it, or to whom <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Book gave the intelligence of it as of a new truth. But <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſus</hi> himſelf refutes this gloſs, <hi>Quamvis ex hoc quidam de ignorantia errent.</hi> This is an ignorance which according to him extends ſo far as the making 'em err in the Article of the Real Preſence. To err in an Article thro igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, is it not a not believing of it at all, as having never heard it men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned? Is not this a knowing nothing of it, a having no knowledg, and conſequently no Faith in it? Now ſuch were <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his ignorant perſons, who were far different from thoſe of Mr. <hi>Arnaud.</hi> In a word, they were people who thought the Bread and Wine were nothing elſe in reſpect of their ſubſtance, than what they appear to our eyes and taſt, as <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> now ſpake.</p>
                        <p>THIS Principle being well eſtabliſh'd, as I believe it is at preſent, 'twill be no hard matter to ſee the conſequence of it. The Author of the <hi>Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity</hi> and Mr.<hi>Arnaud</hi> affirm as an undoubted truth that all the faithful Communicants have ever had a diſtinct knowledg either of the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, or Real Abſence; of the Preſence, if it were taught in the Church, of the Abſence, if the Preſence were not therein taught. Whereupon I raiſe this Argument. There cannot be any perſon in a Church wherein the Real Preſence is commonly taught, but knows diſtinctly the Real Preſence. Now in the Church of the 9th. Century, at which time <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> lived, there were people that were ignorant of the Real Preſence, and erred in this Article thro ignorance. Therefore in the Church of the 9th. Century the Real Preſence was not commonly taught. The firſt propoſition is of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> and Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> without diſtinction or reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the ſecond is of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> himſelf: the concluſion of it I think then is inevitable.</p>
                        <pb n="218" facs="tcp:41961:307"/>
                        <p>'TWILL be reply'd that this Argument is one of thoſe called, <hi>ad ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem,</hi> which does indeed preſs an adverſary by his own proper Principles, but which are not always abſolutely concluſive, becauſe it may happen that the Principles of an Adverſary on which they are grounded be falſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently offered. This Argument then may be convictive againſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> and Mr. <hi>Arnaud.</hi> But the Principle of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> and the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> may be falſe, and conſequently the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion I draw thence.</p>
                        <p>TO ſolve this difficulty, beſides that 'tis a great advantage for the cauſe which I defend, that as able Doctors as theſe Gentlemen remain convict by their own proper Principles. 'Tis to be obſerv'd that theirs being alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native, muſt be diſtinguiſh'd into two propoſitions; one of which is, <hi>All the Communicants have had a diſtinct knowledg of the Real Preſence if the Church of their time taught it.</hi> And the other, <hi>All the Communicants have had a diſtinct knowledg of the Real Abſence, if the Church of their time did not teach the Real Preſence.</hi> In reſpect of this ſecond propoſition the Principle is falſe, as I have ſhew'd in my Anſwer to the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> and in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his 6th. Book, in I think an unanſwerable manner. But in reſpect of the firſt the Principle is true, and muſt be granted, for in effect it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable that a Church ſhould believe and teach commonly that what we receive in the Communion is the proper ſubſtance of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; and yet let perſons of age Communicate without inſtructing them in it; That ſhe ſhould believe and teach a man muſt adore this Sacrament which we receive, publickly practiſe this ſupreme Adoration, and yet one part of the Communicants know nothing of it, and in this reſpect err thro igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. It is then clear that my argument is not barely one of thoſe term'd <hi>ad hominem,</hi> ſeeing 'tis not grounded on the ſecond propoſition of theſe Gentlemens Principle, which is in conteſt, but on the firſt in which both ſides are agreed: ſo that my concluſion has all the ſtrength and truth that can be deſired in every reſpect.</p>
                        <p>NEVERTHELESS we muſt anſwer two of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s minute objections. <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> ſays, <hi>That he dedicated his Book to young People. 'Tis</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 8. ch. 10. p. 859.</note> 
                           <hi>then,</hi> ſays he, <hi>unlikely, that</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>deſign'd to inſtruct the whole world in a truth of which he believ'd both the learned and unlearn'd were ignorant.</hi> I anſwer, 'twas not indeed likely that he had immediately ſo vaſt a deſign. 'Tis more likely he propoſed his Doctrin as he himſelf ſays, <hi>petentibus,</hi> to hir Scholars who pray'd him to ſhew them his ſentiment in this matter; but this does not hinder his Doctrin from being new. <hi>He ſays,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> again, <hi>That he had not written any thing worth his Readers pains. Now no man who diſcovers a myſtery of this importance uſes ſuch humble expreſſions which ſuppoſe he ſays nothing but what's vulgarly known.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives himſelf; for beſides what I intimated in ſeveral places, that thoſe who introduce new Opinions by way of addition, or explication of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ones do not openly declare 'em to be new, but on the contrary endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make 'em ſlip in by means of received expreſſions; beſides this, I ſay, this humility of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> relates not to the things themſelves which he wrote, nor his ſentiment; for he could not term them ſcarcely worth his Readers peruſal, whether they were new, or not. But this relates to the manner of writing 'em, according to what he ſays to <hi>Frudegard, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare non debui quoe loqui ut oportuit minime potui.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>BUT paſs we on to the ſecond proof, which ſhews <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> to be an Innovator. 'Tis taken from the effect which his Doctrin produced in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſons minds, which was, that they oppoſed him. <hi>I have diſcourſed,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Comment in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.</note> ſays he, <hi>of theſe things more at large, becauſe I am informed ſome people have blamed me, as if (in the Book which I publiſh'd of the Sacraments of Chriſt, I would give more to his words than they will bear, or eſtabliſh ſomething elſe than the truth promiſes.</hi> Theſe cenſurers proceed further, for they oppoſed a contrary Doctrin againſt that of <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> to wit, that 'twas the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>in figure, in Sacrament, in virtue.</hi> Which <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> himſelf tells us. <hi>Let thoſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that will extenuate this term of Body hear,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                           <hi>They that tell us 'tis not the true Fleſh of Chriſt which is now celebrated in the Sacrament in the Church, nor his true Blood. They tell us, or rather feign I know not what, as if 'twere a certain virtue of the Fleſh and Blood.</hi> He afterwards repeats two or three times the ſame thing. They proceeded ſo far as to accuſe <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> of Enthuſiaſm, twitting him with having a young mans viſion, as we remark'd in the foregoing Chapter. For this is what may be juſtly collected from theſe words to <hi>Frudegard. You have at</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Frud.</note> 
                           <hi>the end of this Book the ſentiments of the Catholick Fathers which I briefly marked, that you may know that 'tis not thro an Enthuſiaſm of raſhneſs that I have had theſe Viſions, being as yet a young man.</hi> Suppoſing <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> taught nothing but what the whole Church believ'd and commonly taught the Faithful, whence I pray you came theſe Cenſurers? The whole world lived peaceably during eight hundred years in the belief of the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; all the Preachers taught it, all Books contain'd it, all the Faithful believ'd it and diſtinctly knew it; there not having been any body yet that dared contradict it: and yet there appear perſons who preciſely oppoſe it as ſoon as <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> appeared in the world. But who ſo well and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſh'd 'em with the Keys of <hi>figure and virtue</hi> which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would have had all the world to be ignorant of, and th' invention of which he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to the Miniſters. Why if we will believe him they were people that dared not appear openly, that whiſpered ſecretly in mens ears, and yet were ſo well inſtructed that they knew the principal diſtinctions of the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts and all the ſubtilties of their School. But moreover, what fury poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed them to attack thus particularly <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> who ſaid nothing but what all the world knew, even the meaneſt Chriſtian, and what all the world believ'd, and who moreover had no particular conteſt with them? They could not be ignorant that the whole Church was of this opinion, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſhe really did hold it; for as I already ſaid, the Doctrin of the Real Preſence is a popular Doctrin. It is not one of thoſe Doctrins which lie hid in Books or the Schools, which the learned can only know. 'Tis a Doctrin which each particular perſon knows if he knows any thing. Why then muſt <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> be thus teas'd? If they had a deſign to trouble the peace of the Church, why did they not attack its Doctrin, or in general thoſe that held it, which is to ſay, according to Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> the whole world. Why again muſt <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> be rather ſet upon than any body elſe? Does Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> believe this to be very natural? Are people wont to ſet upon a particular perſon, to the excluſion of all others, when he has ſaid no more than what others have ſaid, and what is taught and held by every body? Is ſuch a one liable to reproaches and cenſures? Are we wont to charge ſuch a one with Enthuſiaſtical raſhneſs and pretence to Viſions? It is clear people do not deal thus but with perſons that have gone out of the beaten road, and would introduce novelties in the Church. 'Tis ſuch as
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:41961:308"/> theſe whom we are wont to accuſe, to cenſure and call Enthuſiaſts and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries, and not thoſe that neither vary from the common terms or ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                        <p>TO elude the force of this proof Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has recourſe to his Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology. <note place="margin">Lib. 8. Ch. 10. p. 861, 862.</note> He ſays that the laſt eight Books of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Commentaries on S. <hi>Matthew</hi> were not written till thirty years after his Book <hi>De Corpore &amp; Sanguine Domini.</hi> That he ſpeaks therein of his Cenſures as perſons that reprehended him at the very time he wrote this Commentary, <hi>Miror quid volunt nunc quidam dicere,</hi> and that it does not appear he was reprehended before; ſeeing he did not attempt to defend himſelf. Whence he concludes, <hi>That this Book which Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>ſays offended the whole world as ſoon as 'twas made, was publiſh'd near thirty years before 'twas cenſur'd by any body.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have already replied to this Chronology of Mr. <hi>Arnaud.</hi> Suppoſing there were in effect thirty years between <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Book, and the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of his Adverſaries, 'twill not hence follow that his Doctrin received a general approbation during theſe thirty years, for perhaps this Book was not known, or conſidered by thoſe that were better able to judg of it than others. Printing which now immediately renders a Book publick, was not in uſe in thoſe times; and 'tis likely Tranſcribers were not in any great haſt to multiply the Book of a young Religious of <hi>Corbie,</hi> which he at firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only for his particular friends. Suppoſing this Book was known, it might be neglected thro contempt, or ſome other conſideration, as it oft happens in theſe caſes, altho a Book may contain ſeveral abſured and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Opinions; becauſe it may not be thought fitting to make 'em publick, till it afterwards appears there are perſons who be deceiv'd by it, and that 'tis neceſſary to undeceive them. Moreover, what reaſon is there to ſay, that the cenſures of theſe people hapned not before the time wherein <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> wrote his Commentary on S. <hi>Matthew?</hi> 'Tis becauſe, ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> he ſays, <hi>Miror quid volunt quidam nunc dicere.</hi> But this reaſon is void, for this term <hi>nunc</hi> according to the common ſtile of Authors does refer it ſelf rather in general to the time in which <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> lived, than preciſely to that in which he wrote his Commentary. And as to what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> adds, <hi>That it does not appear he was reprehended before, ſeeing he did not attempt to defend himſelf.</hi> This concludes nothing, unleſs we ſuppoſe that <hi>Paſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> was in a capacity, and in humor, to defend himſelf as ſoon as he knew he was cenſured. Now this ſuppoſition muſt be proved before it be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a thing certain, for this ſuppoſition does not eſtabliſh it ſelf. How many perſons are there who having ſet forth ſingular opinions, do for a long time patiently undergo all cenſures and reprehenſions without replies, in expectation of a convenient time to defend themſelves. <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> had begun his Commentary on S. <hi>Matthew</hi> a great while before he became Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot; 'tis probable he was willing to ſtay till the explication of theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> which he believed ſo advantageous to his cauſe ſhould fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him with an occaſion to ſpeak of his ſentiment, and to defend it againſt the attacks of oppoſers. So that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Chronology for this time will ſtand him in no ſtead.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>WHO has given this liberty,</hi> adds he, <hi>to Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>to give the name of</hi>

                           <pb n="221" facs="tcp:41961:308"/> 
                           <hi>at leaſt thoſe who had read</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>his Book. Now it is exceeding falſe in this ſenſe that the world was aſtoniſh'd at</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>his Book, ſeeing none of his Friends, none of his Society, none of thoſe with whom he met in Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Aſſemblies and Councils, have formally reprehended him for it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT who has given Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> Authority to attribute the name of <hi>unknown perſons</hi> to <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Adverſaries, and to ſay thereupon what he ſays, ſeeing he has no grounds for it, as I have already ſhew'd? Who told him that <hi>John Scot, Bertram</hi> and <hi>Raban,</hi> who were not obſcure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Church of the 9th. Century, have ſtaid till <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his death before they declared themſelves againſt his Opinion, ſuppoſing 'twere true they did not write till after his Death, which is very uncertain? Who has given him power to conclude, That the world was not aſtoniſh'd at <hi>Paſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> his Book, under pretence it does not appear, That he was formally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended about it, neither amongſt his own Society, nor in the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Aſſemblies, nor Councils, ſeeing it does no more appear, that <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram</hi> and <hi>Raban,</hi> when they taught a contrary Doctrin to that of <hi>Paſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> have been formally reprchended for it, either by any one of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or in the publick Aſſemblies, or Councils wherein they aſſiſted? Who has given him right to ſay, as he does, that the world of whom I ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of <hi>ſome ſmall number of raſh and troubleſom Diſputers, who privately blamed what they dared not contradict in publick?</hi> I ſhall not here repeat what I have already obſerved, That 'tis abſurd to endeavour to make us conceive the Adverſaries of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Doctrin as perſons that blamed in ſecret what they dared not contradict in publick; ſeeing the Gentlemen of the Roman Church are forced to acknowledg, at leaſt that after the death of <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> there were publick Writings againſt this very Doctrin, and of which writings the Authors being famous men, did not at all conceal their names; as if the reaſon of this pretended fear depended not on the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, but perſon of <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> who muſt have been at this rate the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of Eccleſiaſtical Writers, whilſt he liv'd. I ſhall only ſay that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has no reaſon to reduce <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Adverſaries, that is to ſay, thoſe who would not receive his Doctrin to a ſmall number. One may in truth reaſonably ſuppoſe, that amongſt thoſe that rejected this novelty, there were ſome that made head, or appeared more than the reſt; and in this ſenſe <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> might ſay that he underſtood ſome reprehended him. But to conclude hence that theſe were the only perſons of their party, and that all the reſt of the Church follow'd the ſentiment of <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> is a groundleſs fancy. <hi>Raban</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his party, calls 'em for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally <note place="margin">Poenitent. Rab. cap. 33.</note> ſome, <hi>Quidam,</hi> ſays he, <hi>nuper de ipſo Sacramento Corporis &amp; Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Domini non rite ſentientes dixerunt hoc ipſum Corpus &amp; Sanguinem Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni quod de Maria Virgine natum eſt.</hi> And the anonymous Author which <hi>Cellot</hi> the Jeſuit has cauſed to be Printed expreſſes himſelf in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner on this ſubject. <hi>Some,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſay that what is received from the Altar is the ſame thing as that which was born of the Virgin. Others deny it and ſay 'tis another thing. Paſchaſus</hi> himſelf formally acknowledges, that thoſe who were not of his opinion, were not a ſmall number; for he deſcribes them under the name of ſeveral or many: <hi>Ideo,</hi> ſays he, <hi>in hac coena Chriſti prolixius elaboravi quam brevitas poſcat tractatoris quia in his myſticis rebus plures aliud ſapiunt.</hi>

                           <hi>AS oft,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud, as a difficult myſtery is propoſed, altho believ'd univerſally by the Faithful, in a manner which cauſes a greater application of</hi>
                           <pb n="222" facs="tcp:41961:309"/> 
                           <hi>Spirit, thoſe mens minds which are not ſufficiently humble, are likely to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed at it, and to endeavour by their reaſon to find out ways whereby to avoid the difficulties which they cannot bear. And thereupon they often ſet upon, the perſon who has propoſed it to 'em endeavouring to diſtinguiſh him from the reſt of the faithful. Even ſometimes theſe ill opinions be already formed. For there are found too oft perſons in the very boſom of the Church, who giving too great liberty to their thoughts and reflections, conceive ideas of myſteries dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent enough from thoſe which the other faithful have of 'em, in turning to their ſenſe moſt of the common expreſſions. And hence it happens, that if any one elſe in following the common notions uſes any term which they alſo cannot reduce to their particular ſenſe, they charge this perſon with boldneſs and raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And this is properly what we have reaſon to believe hapned in</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>his time.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>DOES Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> think to eſcape by theſe circuits and artifices: A difficult myſtery, ſays he, <hi>believed univerſally by the Faithful is propoſed in ſuch a manner as makes people apply themſelves the more to it.</hi> Does he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> had ſaid any thing which is new in his Book concerning the Real Preſence to make men conſider more that point, ſuppoſing it believ'd univerſally by the Faithful? Does <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> examin the conſequences of it, or exaggerate the miraculouſneſs of it, or offer ſeveral objections on the contrary? He does nothing of all this. But only ſays 'tis the ſame Fleſh of Chriſt which was born of the Virgin and roſe again: That the ſubſtance of Bread is converted into the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt, altho the colour and ſavour of Bread remains: That the ſubſtance of Chriſts Body enters into our fleſh. Now this is what all the Faithful univerſally believed and held diſtinctly according to Mr. <hi>Arnaud. As all Chriſtians believe the myſteries,</hi> ſaid he, three pages before, <hi>ſo they likewiſe all believ'd the Euchariſt in</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>his time in the ſame manner as we believe it.</hi> They all then believ'd that 'tis the ſame ſubſtance of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, which he aſſum'd of the Virgin, and which is now in Heaven, and that the ſubſtance of the Bread is converted into it; yet without any change either in the taſt, or colour of the Bread. What has <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> done to make 'em more mind it? <hi>Thoſe mens minds,</hi> adds Mr. <hi>Arnaud, which are not ſufficiently humble are apt to ſtartle, and endeavour by their reaſon to find out ways whereby to ſhun the difficulties which they cannot bear.</hi> Whence ſhould this ſtartling come, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing they believed of the Euchariſt what is commonly believed at this day of it in the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Did they never hear ſay before that they received in the Communion the proper ſubſtance of the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, born of the Virgin, dead and buried, nor that the ſubſtance of Bread is converted into this ſubſtance? If 'twere a novelty, as to them, they did not then believe Tranſubſtantiation, nor the Real Preſence; for 'tis preciſely in theſe ideas wherein theſe Doctrins do conſiſt; and if it be this particular manner of propoſing the myſtery which affrights them, it muſt be neceſſarily acknowledg'd either that they were ſtrangers to theſe ideas before, or that they had been till that time very ſtupid and drowſie, ſeeing they felt not the leaſt trouble about it, altho they had 'em always before their eyes; whereas now a ſimple propoſal of the ſame things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any objection, without exaggeration, affrights, and conſtrains them to find out by their reaſon ways whereby t'avoid the difficulties which they cannot bear. <hi>And then they commonly ſet upon him who propoſed it to 'em, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to diſtinguiſh him from the reſt of the faithful.</hi> Which is to ſay, that they then loſe their ſenſes. For 'tis mere madneſs to ſet particularly upon
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:41961:309"/> 
                           <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> who only propoſed to 'em in a manner the moſt ſimple imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, if we will believe Mr. <hi>Arnaud, without either Preface,</hi> ſays he, <hi>arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial method, or diſguiſe,</hi> what the whole Church believ'd, and what they believe themſelves. Even <hi>ſometimes theſe ill opinions are already formed.</hi> Here Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> acknowledges one part of the truth. For the truth is, that theſe people here mention'd never heard of the novelties of <hi>Paſchaſus.</hi> They knew only that the Euchariſt was the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in Figure, in Sacrament, and in Virtue, as they themſelves explain'd their ſenſe about it; and this was the true cauſe of their aſtoniſhment, and the only reaſon for which they accus'd <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> of Enthuſiaſms and Viſions. But let Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> explain, if he pleaſes, in what manner according to him theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons lived in the Communion of the Church. <hi>They turn'd to their own ſenſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>moſt of the common expreſſions.</hi> How happens it Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> who but the laſt moment could not ſuffer me to ſay <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> abuſed an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Church, and turn'd it to another ſenſe, now comprehended well enough, that this whole Party turn'd to their ſenſe moſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon expreſſions? He that told us that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> would be a <hi>mad man</hi> ſhould he make uſe of this expreſſion had he known the Church underſtood it in another ſenſe, will grant at preſent that theſe perſons accommodated the greateſt part of the Churches expreſſions to their ſenſe, without troubling 'emſelves with the ſenſe wherein the Church underſtood them? Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi>'s Argument is like <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s <hi>prima materia,</hi> capable of any form at divers times. Does his intereſt require the Churches expreſſions to be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? This may be done, there are reaſons for it. Does the ſame intereſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that it be a ſenſleſs thing to abuſe 'em: This cannot be, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons on the contrary are not wanting. For in fine, either theſe people were ignorant of the true ſenſe in which the Church underſtood theſe expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or they were not. If they were ignorant of it, <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> might be as well ignorant of it as they. If they were not ignorant of it, and yet abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> might as well do the ſame, contrary to his own knowledg. <hi>They turn'd to their ſenſe moſt of the uſual expreſſions.</hi> It ſeems that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> by this ſuppoſes there were ſome of theſe expreſſions which might be turn'd by them. Yet he adds; <hi>And hence it happens that if any other perſon in following the ordinary notions makes uſe of any terms which they cannot in the ſame manner reduce to their particular ſenſe, they charge this perſon with raſhneſs.</hi> This diſcourſe thus couch'd has no coherence, for if amongſt the ordinary expreſſions there remain'd ſtill ſome of 'em, which they could not reduce to their ſenſe, why muſt they ſet upon <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> in particular, who not only follow'd the ſenſe of the Church, but alſo her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, to wit, thoſe which were too plain and full to be perverted? Why muſt he then be accuſed of raſhneſs? 'Tis evident Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſtood upon Thorns, when he wrote this Anſwer. A reaſon muſt be given why theſe perſons before us reprehended <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> in particular, and accuſed him of being a raſh perſon. Now there cannot be naturally any other but this, That <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> had propoſed a new Doctrin in the Church which was never before heard of; having aſſerted the Euchariſt to be the ſame Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt born of the Virgin, dead and riſen again. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to avoid the making of this Confeſſion, ſuppoſes there were a party in the Church that did not believe the Real Preſence; he will have theſe perſons turn to their ſenſe the common expreſſions; but not being able to do the ſame with that of <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> this was the reaſon why they ſet upon him in particular, and accuſed him of raſhneſs. To make this anſwer paſs currant, it muſt be neceſſarily ſuppoſed that the expreſſions of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> were peculiarly of this
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:41961:310"/> nature, that they could not be turn'd to the ſenſe of theſe people, and that this was their particular character which diſtinguiſh'd them from all the common expreſſions, for a reaſon muſt be found why they ſet particularly upon <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> as a raſh perſon, and this reaſon muſt be ſomething that was ſingular in <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> But to acknowledg this frankly and clearly Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> muſt engage himſelf in terrible ill conveniencies, for this would be an acknowledging there was not any thing in the common expreſſions of the Church at that time which was expreſly for the Real Preſence, and which might not be turn'd to another ſenſe; which is to ſay, that all the common expreſſions were general, equivocal, and ambiguous. By this means he would have expoſed himſelf to abundance of queſtions, as amongſt others to theſe, Whence <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> could know the Church believ'd the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, ſeeing all her expreſſions were capable of another ſenſe. Whence he knew the Church underſtood theſe expreſſions in one ſenſe rather than in another, ſeeing ſhe never expreſs'd her ſelf about 'em in a clear and incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner of being perverted. Who has given liberty to <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin what the Church did not determin, and t' expreſs in particular terms what the Church only expreſs'd in general ones? Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> who plainly foreſaw theſe inconveniencies, has thought beſt to expeſs himſelf in an aenig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical manner, as thoſe generally do who on one hand are urged by the force of truth and ſequel of their own arguing, but who on the other are retain'd by the fear of ſaying too much. <hi>They pervert,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to their ſenſe moſt of the common expreſſions, And hence it happens, that if any body elſe in following the common notions, makes uſe of any term which they cannot in the ſame manner reduce to their particular ſenſe, they accuſe this perſon of raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This is exactly what we have reaſon to believe hapned in</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>his time.</hi> Here's exactly the deſcription of a man that flies, but fears to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in flying, and therefore provides for himſelf another evaſion againſt all occaſions.</p>
                        <p>MY third proof is taken from <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his propoſing his Opinion in the manner of a paradox which muſt raviſh the world with admiration. <hi>Altho theſe things,</hi> ſays he, <hi>have the figure of Bread and Wine, yet muſt we</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. de Corp. &amp; Sang. Dom.</note> 
                           <hi>believe that they are nothing elſe after Conſecration than the Fleſh and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. And therefore the truth it ſelf ſaid to his Diſciples, This is my Fleſh for the life of the world. And to explain my ſelf in a more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful manner. Et ut mirabilius loquar, 'tis entirely nothing elſe but the Fleſh which was born of the Virgin and ſuffered on the Croſs, and is riſen from the Sepulchre.</hi> Theſe terms <hi>ut mirabilius loquar,</hi> are the expreſſion of one that pretends to ſay ſomething extraordinary and ſurprizing.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D</hi> anſwers, <hi>That all Miracles are not Paradoxes:</hi> I grant <note place="margin">Book 8. ch. 10. p. 865.</note> it, and therefore they are not all expreſs'd in this manner, <hi>ut mirabilius loquar. Did S.</hi> Chryſoſtom, adds he, <hi>offer a Paradox when he broke forth into this expreſſion concerning the Euchariſt, O wonderful! he that is at the right hand of God is between the hands of the Prieſts?</hi> I anſwer, that in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this diſcourſe of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> is a true Paradox, a Paradox of an Orator, which ſeems at firſt to contradict common ſenſe, altho that in effect being rightly underſtood it does not; but that of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> is a falſe Paradox, becauſe it oppoſed in effect and at bottom not only common ſenſe, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe truth. As to what remains, I know not why Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will have theſe terms tranſlated, <hi>ut mirabilius loquar,</hi> by theſe. The better to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain <hi>to you this marvail.</hi> The Rules of Grammar muſt be changed to
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:41961:310"/> favour this Tranſlation, <hi>ut mirabilius loquar,</hi> naturally ſignifies, <hi>to ſpeak, or explain my ſelf in a more admirable manner,</hi> or at moſt, <hi>to ſay ſomething more admirable,</hi> which is to ſay, that the expreſſion which he was going to uſe, or the thing it ſelf which he was about to ſpeak, was extraordinary and ſurprizing. Now this ſhews he acknowledg'd at leaſt that his expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or conceptions were new, whence 'tis not difficult to conjecture that his Doctrin was as new as his expreſſions.</p>
                        <p>WE may make another conjecture from his ſubmitting his Doctrin to the judgment of <hi>Frudegard,</hi> and intreating him to ſee what is reprehenſible in it. He tells him he ſends to him his Commentary on the 26. of S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> and adds, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t ex ipſo conſiderare queas, quid intelligibilius credendum ſit, vel quid in me reprehendendum cum charitate, To the end that you may know what is more rationally to be believed, or what there is in me that may be charitably blamed.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is miſtaken if he believes I ground my conjecture in general on this deference of humility which <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> had for <hi>Frudegard.</hi> We know that wiſe Authors are wont to acknowledg them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves liable to miſtakes, and ſubmit themſelves to the cenſures of their friends. 'Tis not this. Here is ſomething more particular which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire may be conſidered. <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> declares in his Letter that he was cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured for teaching the Real Preſence, and taking the words of our Lord in a wrong ſenſe. Even <hi>Frudegard</hi> himſelf propoſes to him an objection againſt his Doctrin, he defends himſelf the beſt he can, he deſires <hi>Frudegard</hi> to read his Book over often, he ſends to him his Commentary on S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> wherein he treats of the ſame thing, and leaves <hi>Frudegard</hi> to the liberty of his judgment, to ſee what may be more rationally believ'd, or what may be charitably reprehended in him, <hi>Quid intelligibilius credendum ſit, vel quid in me reprehendendum cum charitate.</hi> Who ſees not the queſtion is only of the Real Preſence, and that what he ſubmits to the judgment of <hi>Frudegard</hi> is to know which is moſt reaſonable, either to believe it, or not to believe it; to know whether it be, or be not worthy of reprehenſion to have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd it. But who does not likewiſe ſee that this cannot be the language of a man that taught nothing but what the Church then believed; for people do not thus ſubmit the Faith of the whole Church, and ſuch a clear, certain, and undeniable Faith, as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſuppoſes this was, to the judgment of a particular perſon, leaving him at liberty to take that part which he finds moſt reaſonable, and that of reprehending him, that is to ſay of cenſuring him, provided he does it with charity.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D</hi> reckons for my 6th. proof this, <hi>That</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>does</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Page 868.</note> 
                           <hi>never vaunt this his Doctrin was formally that of the whole Church.</hi> This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark conſiſts in a fact which we have already diſcuſs'd, and found to be true. I need only add, that if ever man was oblig'd loudly to offer, and without heſitation, the formal conſent of the Church of his time, and to proteſt he had ſaid nothing but what all the Biſhops, and Religious of his time ſpake in conformity with him, and what all the Faithful made profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to believe with him, 'twas <hi>Paſchaſus.</hi> He was ſet upon in particular, he was reprehended for ill expounding the words of Chriſt, his Doctrin was oppoſed by a contrary Doctrin, he was accuſed for being a raſh perſon, a viſionary. Now how could he after all this neglect the ſhelt'ring himſelf from all theſe inſultings, and making 'em return with confuſion upon his Adverſaries by ſaying clearly that all the faithful people in the Church at that time, whether Paſtors or others ſpake no otherwiſe than he did, and that
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:41961:311"/> his Adverſaries were faln into the utmoſt exceſs of impudence? But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of this he has recourſe to ſome paſſages which he perverts as well as he can to his ſenſe, and to a clauſe of the Liturgy wherein there is <hi>Corpus Chriſti.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>PASCHAS<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> furniſhes us likewiſe with another conjecture from the manner in which he explains his ſentiments on this ſubject of the Euchariſt. For he keeps as much as he can the Sacramental expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, endeavouring to accommodate them to his ſenſe, and proceeds ſometimes ſo far that he ſeems to conſerve the ſubſtance of Bread; which appears by ſeveral paſſages which I remark'd in my anſwer to the <hi>Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity,</hi> and which is not neceſſary to repeat here. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> anſwers, <hi>That the only concluſion which reaſon draws from hence is, that theſe Sacramental</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Page 866.</note> 
                           <hi>expreſſions do perfectly agree with the Faith of the Real Preſence.</hi> But if they do agree 'tis by conſtraint, and in doing violence to the nature and ſignification of the terms. When <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> ſays for example, <hi>In pane &amp; vino ſine ulla decoloratione ſubſtancioe hoc myſterium interius vi &amp; poteſtate divina peragitur.</hi> What violence muſt not be offered theſe terms to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate them to the change of the ſubſtance of Bread? For to ſay that the ſubſtance of Bread loſes not his colour, is an expreſſion which naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes this ſenſe, that the ſubſtance remains with its colour. What violence muſt not be offered theſe other terms. <hi>Caro &amp; Sanguis per Spiritum San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum conſecratur, alioqui mihi nec caro eſt nec ſanguis eſt, ſed judicium quod percipio, quia ſine donante ſpiritu nullum male proeſumentibus donum ex Deo proeſtatur.</hi> What violence I ſay muſt not be offered them to accommodate 'em to the ſenſe of Tranſubſtantiation? For naturally theſe terms ſignifie, that 'tis the Holy Spirit dwelling in the Faithful, which makes the Bread and Wine be to 'em the Fleſh and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, for which reaſon the Wicked who have not the Holy Spirit do not receive this Fleſh and Blood. This language then of conſtraint ſhews that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> ſtrove ſtill to conſerve the common expreſſions, altho that in effect they were contrary to him, whence we may eaſily conclude that he was an Innovator.</p>
                        <p>A ſeventh proof may be taken from the teſtimonies of <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Sirmond</hi> both Jeſuits, which I have already mention'd in my Anſwer to the <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> The one ſays that <hi>Paſchaſus was the firſt Author that wrote ſeriouſly and at large of the truth of the Body and Blood of Chriſt in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,</hi> and the other aſſures us, <hi>that he was the firſt that explain'd the true ſentiment of the Catholick Church, in ſuch a manner that he has opened the way to others.</hi> The firſt idea which theſe words preſent us with is, that <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſus</hi> was the firſt Author that propoſed the Doctrin of the Real Preſence clearly, and in plain and preciſe terms; for this is what is meant by the <hi>Serio</hi> of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and eſpecially the <hi>Explicuit</hi> of <hi>Sirmond.</hi> And 'twill ſignifie nothing to anſwer as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does, that theſe paſſages mean on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>that</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>was the firſt who collected into one Book what lay ſcattered in</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 8 ch. 10. page 867.</note> 
                           <hi>ſeveral of the Fathers Writings, according as</hi> Athanaſius <hi>was the firſt who wrote expreſly Treatiſes on the Trinity, and S.</hi> Cyril <hi>the firſt who largely wrote of the Incarnation and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of perſons in our Lord and Saviour, as S.</hi> Auguſtin <hi>is the firſt who has largely and ſeriouſly treated of Original Sin, and that as</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>had good ſucceſs in this labor, and in effect well collected the true ſentiments of the Fathers, ſo he has been follow'd by all that came after him.</hi> This anſwer is an illuſion, for 'tis far from completely anſwering <hi>Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>'s words, <hi>Genuinum,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Eccleſioe Catholicoe ſenſum ita primus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicuit,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Invita paſch.</note>
                           <pb n="227" facs="tcp:41961:311"/> 
                           <hi>ut viam coeteris aperuit, qui de eodem argumento multa poſtea ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſere.</hi> He means not that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> was the firſt who collected in one Book what lay here and there in the Writings of the Fathers, but that he firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd the true ſenſe of the Catholick Church. Before him, according to <hi>Sirmond,</hi> this true ſentiment, which is to ſay, the Doctrin of the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, for this is what he means, was a confuſed and hidden matter. <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſus</hi> was the firſt who brought it to light, and he did it in ſuch manner that he opened the way to all that came after him. Till his time this way lay hid, he found it, firſt entred into it, and by his example moved others to do the ſame, Now this is the honeſteſt confeſſion imaginable, that <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſus</hi> was the firſt Author of this Doctrin; for in fine this explication of the true ſentiment of the Church, and this way, are nothing elſe but the Real Preſence, and he was the firſt diſcoverer of it. There cannot be any thing ſaid like this of S. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in reſpect of the Trinity, nor of S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril</hi> in reſpect of the Incarnation, nor of S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> in reſpect of Original Sin. It may be indeed ſaid that they have treated more amply of theſe matters than what was done before, that they have more firmly grounded them by diſengaging them from the objections of Hereticks; but it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſaid they were the firſt that explain'd the true ſentiment of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, for it was explain'd, and diſtinctly known before them. The Church worſhip'd before <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his time three diſtinct perſons in the Godhead, acknowledged two Natures, and one only perſon in Jeſus Chriſt before S. <hi>Cyril</hi>'s time, and S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s, and alſo believ'd that all the Children of <hi>Adam</hi> came into the world infected with his corruption.</p>
                        <p>THESE are the ſeven proofs of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Innovation, which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has cited from me, and which he has endeavoured to anſwer. But, beſides theſe, there are alſo ſome others which he has paſt over in ſilence, and of which 'twill not be amiſs to put him in mind. I draw then an eighth from the teſtimony of <hi>Berenger,</hi> which makes <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> preciſely as we do, the Author of the Opinion which aſſerts the real converſion of the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Bread and Wine. <hi>Sententia,</hi> ſays he, <hi>imo vecordia vulgi, Paſchaſi</hi>

The opinion, or rather folly of the Vulgar, of</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>and</hi> Lanfranc, <hi>that the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine remains not after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration. Lanfrac</hi> who cites theſe words, ſays a little after, that when the Letters of <hi>Berenger</hi> were read at <hi>Rome,</hi> 'twas known that he exalted <hi>John Scot</hi> and condemned <hi>Paſchaſus, intellecto quod Joannem Scotum extolleres Paſchaſium damnares.</hi> This moreover appears by <hi>Berenger</hi>'s Letter to <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, injuſtiſſime damnatum Scotum Joannem, injuſtiſſime nihilo minus aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Paſchaſium in Concilio Vercellenſi.</hi> And his Letter to <hi>Aſcelin, You are,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Tom. 2. Spic. in not. advitam Lanfran. ad Luc.

Century when the Diſpute about the Euchariſt grew hot, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:41961:312"/> ſaid the ſame thing then we do now. We ſee <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> in the 9th. Century charg'd with Enthuſiaſms and Viſions; in the 11th. reſpected as the Father of Tranſubſtantiation, as he that drew it only from his own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, theſe two matters of fact are moreover confirm'd by I know not how many other conſiderable matters hereunto relating. And Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> comes telling us confidently, that he marvails we ſhould dare ſtill attribute this Innovation to <hi>Paſchaſus, and that our proofs are mere ſophiſms and conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures not worth the minding.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE anonymous Author which <hi>Cellot</hi> the Jeſuit has publiſh'd furniſhes us with a 9th. proof in his way of defending <hi>Paſchaſus.</hi> For having ſaid, <hi>That ſome aſſert what we receeive from the Altar is the ſame as that which is</hi>

                           <hi>born of the Virgin, and that others deny it, and ſay that 'tis another thing,</hi> he adds a little after. <hi>Now for thoſe which ſay 'tis the ſame thing as that which was born of the Virgin, or ſay 'tis another thing, we ſhall relate the ſeveral opinions of the Holy Fathers which do indeed appear to be different, but yet be ſatisfactory enough were they fully underſtood with diſcretion. Now I ſpeak of</hi> Paſchaſus Ratbert, <hi>Abbot of</hi> Corby, <hi>who whether he was required, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, for 'tis uncertain which, has wrote on this matter a Book of about an hundred Chapters, which he has fill'd with ſeveral Authorities of the Fathers, and under the name of S.</hi> Ambroſe <hi>has therein eſtabliſh'd that what we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the Altar is entirely the ſame Fleſh which was born of the Virgin, ſuffered on the Croſs, riſen from the Sepulchre, and is at this day oſſered for the life of the world.</hi> Raban <hi>in his Epiſtle to the Abbot</hi> Egilon, <hi>and one</hi> Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram <hi>in a Book dedicated to King</hi> Charles, <hi>argue ſufficiently againſt him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that 'tis not this ſame Fleſh; which they prove by the teſtimony of S.</hi> Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom, <hi>which ſays, that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt may be ſaid to be in two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and by the Authority of S.</hi> Auguſtin, <hi>which ſays, that this term may be taken three ways. And becauſe they maintain that in S.</hi> Ambroſe'<hi>s Books we do not find it exactly thus, we ſhall relate not only the paſſage of S.</hi> Ambroſe <hi>without any alteration, but alſo thoſe of S.</hi> Auguſtin, <hi>S.</hi> Hierom, <hi>and others in the manner we found 'em, to the end that having conſidered them it may appear to thoſe to whom it ſhall pleaſe God to reveal it, that theſe great men did not differ one from another in opinion, and that in the Catholick Church we muſt all have the ſame mind without the leaſt Schiſm.</hi> Hitherto we do not find that this defender of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> has recourſe to the publick Belief of the Church of his time, or proteſts that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> has offered nothing but what all Chriſtians did generally agree to, except ſome ſmall number of troubleſom <hi>Diſputers, who denied in ſecret what they dared not contradict in publick,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſpeaks.. We find on the contrary that he denotes thoſe which held the Doctrin of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> under the name of <hi>ſome,</hi> and the oppoſite party under the name of <hi>others. Dicentibus quibuſdam idem eſſe quod ſumitur de altari, quod &amp; illud quod natum eſt ex Virgine, aliis autem negantibus.</hi> This is not the language of one who was perſuaded the whole Church ſpake like <hi>Paſchaſus.</hi> But this will ſtill further appear if we conſider what this ſame Author adds afterwards, for having alledged ſome paſſages of the Fathers which he believ'd favour'd <hi>Paſchaſus, Hoec ideo,</hi> ſays he, <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſita ſunt ſi forte per ea ſimplicitas Paſchaſi Ratberti poſſit excuſari, unde ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime ab obloquentibus Rabano &amp; Ratramno ſugillari videtur, quid dixerat ean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem eſſe carnem quoe de Altari ſumitur &amp; de virgine generatur, &amp; quoe quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidie adhuc pro mundi ſalute immolatur. I have brought theſe paſſages to ſee whether one could not excuſe the ſimplicity of</hi> Paſchaſus Ratbert, <hi>eſpecially in reſpect of that particular for which he is blamed by his Adverſaries,</hi> Raban
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:41961:312"/> 
                           <hi>and</hi> Ratram, <hi>for ſaying that what we receive from the Altar is the ſame Fleſh which was born of the Virgin, and is ſtill every day immolated for the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world.</hi> Now let any man ſeriouſly tell me, whether people are wont to defend after this manner one who has the whole Church on his ſide, excepting ſome <hi>troubleſom raſh Diſputers?</hi> Is ſuch a ones ſimplicity endeavoured to be excuſed by any body? Do we ſay in ſuch a caſe, <hi>if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may be excuſable?</hi> Do people place on one hand irreconcilable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries who defame him, and on the other ſimple excuſes, and excuſes offered in a fearful and doubtful manner, <hi>Si forte ſimplicitas Paſchaſii poſſit excuſari?</hi> Let Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſay what he pleaſes, the diſcourſe of this anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Author offers ſuch an idea of the Adverſaries of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> as of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that delivered themſelves openly in the Church, who had then advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage over <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> even to the defaming him for teaching the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and furniſhes us at the ſame time with the idea of <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> as of a man who muſt be excuſed upon the account of his ſimplicity, but yet his expreſſions may be defended by ſome paſſages of the Fathers. Now theſe two ideas plainly enough ſhew that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> was an Innovator.</p>
                        <p>THERE are other proofs in my Anſwer to the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> which I do not think neceſſary to repeat here, having nothing more to add to 'em. We will paſs then to Authors who were Contemporaries with <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> to know of them whether they taught the ſame Doctrin as he did.</p>

                           <p>
                              <hi>Of Authors in the Ninth Century,</hi> Walafridus, Strabo, Florus, Remy <hi>of</hi> Auxerre, Chſtriian Drutmar.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>WE may now ſay (I hope (with ſome kind of confidence, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s inſultings, that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> was an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator. This is a truth ſufficiently clear'd by what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done in the two preceding Chapters. But to make this (if poſſible) more plain, we muſt make ſome few reflections on the Authors which were of the ſame Century as <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> beſides what I already ſaid of 'em in my Anſwer to the <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> For if it appears that theſe Authors have not held the ſame language as he did; if it appears on the contrary that they have expreſs'd themſelves on the Euchariſt quite otherwiſe than he has done; if one party of 'em have formally declared themſelves againſt his Doctrin, I ſee no reaſon why any man ſhould ſtill obſtinately maintain that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> has ſaid or wrote nothing but what the Church of his time believed and taught with him.</p>
                        <p>FIRST 'tis certain we ſhall not find the Authors of that Century, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho they were not inconſiderable for their number, and almoſt all of 'em wrote ſomething on the Euchariſt, have delivered themſelves on ſo great a ſubject in the manner <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> has done, neither in reſpect of the ſenſe, nor terms. Let any man ſhew us for example they have aſſerted <hi>that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Bread is converted into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that it does not any longer remain, altho the ſavour and colour ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:41961:313"/> or taught <hi>that the ſubſtance of the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt enters into our Body,</hi> that what we receive from the Altar <hi>is nothing elſe but the ſame Fleſh which was born of the Virgin, which died and was buried, and that 'tis this Fleſh in propriety of nature;</hi> or have ſaid that this Fleſh of the word <hi>pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lule</hi> (this is the expreſſion <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> uſes) which is to ſay, that it multiplies it ſelf, and that this multiplication is made in the Sacrament, and yet the ſame Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, and that yet he remains wholly entire. Let any one ſhew us any thing like this in theſe Authors. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ought to have employed himſelf in this, inſtead of expatiating as he has done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vain arguments. Twenty whole Chapters will not ſo well ſatisfie ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional perſons, as twelve clear paſſages out of Authors of the 9tth. Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, did they contain the ſame Doctrin which <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> has ſet down in his Writings; for this would ſhew the conformity there was between him and his Contemporaries, and at the ſame time diſcharge him from the accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of novelty, which we lay againſt him. But there is no danger of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s taking upon him this task, becauſe he knows 'tis impoſſible to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit himſelf well of it.</p>
                        <p>IN the ſecond place 'tis certain theſe Authors have not only not ſpoke of the Euchariſt as <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> has done, but on the contrary, have ſpoke of it in a very different manner from his: whence we may eaſily collect that his Doctrin agreed in no ſort with theirs. I ſhall begin with <hi>Walafridus Strabo,</hi> whoſe words may be ſeen more at length in my anſwer to the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity.</hi> We ſhall find him thus ſpeaking, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt has eſtabliſh'd</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Anſwer to the ſecond Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, part 3. ch. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>the Sacraments of his Body and Blood in the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine. That our Saviour has choſen the Bread and Wine, to wit, the ſame ſpecies which</hi> Melchiſedec <hi>offered, to be the myſtery of his Body and Blood: That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of this great diverſity of Sacrifices which were in uſe under the Law, the Faithful muſt be contented with the ſimple Oblation of Bread and Wine.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> may talk as long as he pleaſes, that theſe are expreſſions which do naturally link themſelves with the belief of the Real Preſence. Which is what we deny him. Theſe expreſſions do naturally ſignifie nothing elſe, but that the Sacrament is real Bread and real Wine, and if any uſe theſe kind of expreſſions in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they do it merely by conſtraint to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate themſelves in ſome ſort to the expreſſions of the Ancients. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> again tells us that <hi>Walafridus</hi> ſays, <hi>That the myſteries be really the Body and Blood of our Lord.</hi> But we have already ſeveral times told him that <hi>Walafridus</hi> explains himſelf in the ſame place, and refers this <hi>really</hi> to the virtue, not the ſubſtance of Chriſts Body, which alſo appears from the title of his Chapter, which is, <hi>De virtute Sacramentorum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>FLOR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> an Author of the ſame Century, who has wrote a kind of <note place="margin">Florus magiſter in Expoſit. Miſſae.</note> Commentary on the Liturgy, ſays, <hi>That the Oblation altho taken from the ſimple</hi> fruits <hi>of the Earth is made to the Faithful, fidelibus, the Body and Blood of the only Son of God.</hi> After which, borrowing the words of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin,</hi> he ſays, <hi>That the Conſecration makes us this Body and this myſtical Blood.</hi> And the better to explicate what he means by this Body and this myſtical Blood, he adds, <hi>That the Creature of Bread is made the Sacrament of the Fleſh and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, that 'tis eaten Sacramentally, that it remains wholly entire in Heaven, and is ſo in our hearts.</hi> And again a little further, <hi>Whatſoever is done in this Oblation of the Body and Blood of our Lord is a myſtery. We ſee therein one thing, and underſtand another; what we ſee has a corporal ſpecies, what we underſtand has a ſpiritual fruit.</hi> What
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:41961:313"/> he ſays of this myſtical Body and Blood which he explains afterwards by the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the Fleſh and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, in referring to this alone the effect of the Conſecration ſufficiently denotes he had not in his view either change of ſubſtance, or any Real Preſence. The oppoſition likewiſe which he makes of Jeſus Chriſt eaten in <hi>parts in the Sacrament,</hi> to himſelf who remains entire in Heaven, and who enters entire into our hearts does no leſs denote it; for to what purpoſe is this diſtinction? If our Saviour Chriſt be really in the Sacrament, is he not eaten entire in the ſame manner in our hearts, and wholly entire in Heaven? The former words, that whatſoever is done in the Euchariſt is <hi>a myſtery wherein we ſoe one thing, and underſtand another,</hi> teſtifie the ſame thing; for what is this <hi>thing</hi> which we ſee, but the Bread and Wine, and what is this <hi>other</hi> which we <hi>underſtand</hi> but the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, which are the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our underſtanding? He explains himſelf immediately afterwards, <hi>The myſtery,</hi> ſays he, <hi>of our Redemption was Wine, according to what our Saviour himſelf ſays. I will drink no more of this fruit of the Vine.</hi> And again, <hi>Our Lord recommends to us this myſtery, ſaying, Do this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me, which the Apoſtle explaining, ſays, As often as yee eat of this Bread, and drink of this Cup, yee ſhew forth the Lords Death till he comes: The Oblation then of this Bread, and this Cup is the Commemoration, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of the Death of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> That which is moſt conſiderable is his making this Commentary on the very words of the Conſecration, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out adjoyning a word either of the converſion of ſubſtances, or ſubſtantial Preſence of the Body and Blood of our Lord.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D,</hi> who oft loſes his time in vain conteſts, leaves all theſe principal paſſages which I come now from relating, and ſets himſelf only againſt the tranſlation of theſe words, <hi>Oblatio quamvis de ſimplicibus terroe frugibus ſumpta, divinoe benedictionis ineffabili potentia efficitur fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus Corpus &amp; Sanguis.</hi> I ſaid that this <hi>fidelibus</hi> muſt be rendred, <hi>to the Faithful,</hi> and not <hi>for the Faithful;</hi> and for this I alledged ſome reaſons. <hi>This is a thing,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud, which I could willingly grant him, did he ask it with a better meen: for either tranſlation is indifferent to me. But ſeeing he's reſolv'd to carry it away by force, I think I'm oblig'd to tell him that he is unjuſt.</hi> So that here Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has a quarrel with me for my carriage.
<q>
                              <l>Si natura negat facit indignatio verſum.</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Truly I'm ſorry I cannot make my ſelf agreeable to him, I do what I can, as much as reaſon and truth will permit; but there are ſome perſons ſo unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py that they cannot give content do what they can.</p>
                        <p>I am to Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> what <hi>Sabidus</hi> was to <hi>Martial.</hi> I cannot help it. But had he been pleaſed to take his eyes off my perſon, and conſidered the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he had ſeen, that theſe two tranſlations are not in effect indifferent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that which ſays, <hi>for the Faithful,</hi> ſeems ſimply to denote that the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt is naturally deſign'd for the uſe of the Faithful, and not for that of the wicked; whereas the other denotes that 'tis the Body and Blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, only to the Faithful, and not to the wicked; which is wholly different. Secondly. That that which ſays, <hi>to the Faithful,</hi> is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Rules of Grammar, according to which commonly, <hi>fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> ſignifies, <hi>to the Faithful,</hi> and <hi>pro fidelibus, for the Faithful.</hi> Thirdly, That the ſequel of <hi>Florus</hi> his diſcourſe denotes his ſenſe to be that the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:41961:314"/> is not the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, but only to the Faithful, becauſe he immediately adds, that as we eat Jeſus Chriſt by pieces in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, he is <hi>wholly entire in our heart,</hi> which can only reſpect the Faithful to the excluſion of the wicked; and becauſe he ſays, that we ſee in the Sacrament one thing, and <hi>underſtand by it another which has a ſpiritual fruit,</hi> which moreover appertains only to the Faithful. What he alledges from <hi>Remy</hi> of <hi>Auxerre,</hi> who explains this clauſe, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t nobis Corpus &amp; Sanguis fiat dilectiſſimi filii tui,</hi> by theſe words, <hi>id eſt ad noſtram ſalutem fiat Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus &amp; Sanguis,</hi> is invalid, becauſe we may tell him, that had <hi>Florus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to ſay the ſame thing as <hi>Remus,</hi> he would have explain'd himſelf like to <hi>Remus;</hi> which he has not done; beſides that the explication of <hi>Remus</hi> is not contrary to that of <hi>Florus:</hi> for it does not follow from the Sacraments being made the Body of Jeſus Chriſt for our Salvation, that it be made his Body and Blood to the Wicked. All the difference there is between theſe two Expoſitions is, that that of <hi>Florus</hi> is more clear and expreſs than the other. We can conclude very clearly from that of <hi>Florus</hi> that the Euchariſt is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt only to the Faithful, but not to the wicked, but one cannot draw this conſequence from that of <hi>Remus,</hi> neither can one draw a contrary one.</p>
                        <p>THIS concluſion which I draw from the paſſage of <hi>Florus</hi> offends Mr. <hi>Arnaud; By the like argument,</hi> ſays he, <hi>he will prove that</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>did</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 8. ch. 7. p. 822.</note> 
                           <hi>not believe the Real Preſence, for this Author ſays as well as</hi> Florus <hi>that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt grants us by his grace, that the Euchariſt be to us his Body and Blood. He will prove,</hi> adds he, <hi>That all the Catholick Prieſts do no more believe Tranſubſtantiation, ſeeing they ſay this Prayer,</hi> in the Canon of the Maſs. <hi>Quam Oblationem tu Deus in omnibus quoeſumus adſcriptam, ratam, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionabilem, acceptabilemque: facere digneris, ut nobis Corpus &amp; Sanguis fiat dilectiſſimi tui filii Domini noſtri Jeſu Chriſti.</hi> I anſwer there is a great deal of difference between <hi>Florus</hi> and <hi>Paſchaſus. Paſchaſus</hi> formally teaches the Doctrin of the Real Preſence and converſion of ſubſtances. <hi>Florus</hi> does not do any thing like this. When then we judg of <hi>Florus</hi> his expreſſion, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon requires us to judg of it according to the ſenſe which it naturally has; but when we judg of that of <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> we muſt judg of it according to the forced and violent ſenſe which is given to this expreſſion to make it agree with Tranſubſtantiation, and the Real Preſence, becauſe it appears to us elſewhere that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> believed theſe Doctrins. When <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> ſpeaks of what the Wicked receive in the Euchariſt, he ſpeaks of it in a manner ſo intricate and confuſed, that it viſibly appears he affects to be obſcure. Explaining theſe words, <hi>He that eats my Fleſh, and drinks my Blood</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. de Corp. &amp; Sang. Dom. cap. 6.</note> 
                           <hi>dwells in me and I in him,</hi> he introduces our Saviour ſaying, <hi>If he does not firſt dwell in me and I in him, he cannot eat my Fleſh nor drink my Blood. And what then is it which men do eat: Do not all indifferently take the Sacraments of the Altar? They take 'em without doubt, but one eats ſpiritually the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, and drinks his Blood, and the other not, altho he ſeems to take the morſel from the Prieſts hand. And what does he then receive, there being but one Conſecration, if he does not receive the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt? Truly becauſe the Wicked receive unworthily, they eat and drink their own damnation, acccording to the ſaying of the Apoſtle; for they do not try themſelves before they come, nor diſcern the Lords Body. And this is what the Wicked eat and drink. They do not profitably receive the Fleſh and Blood, but their own damnation.</hi> This plainly appears to be the diſcourſe of a man that hides himſelf, and durſt not ſay openly the wicked receive the Body
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:41961:314"/> and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſeems to inſinuate the contrary; but yet ſtill contains himſelf within theſe terms of <hi>ſpiritually</hi> and <hi>profitably</hi> that he may ſave himſelf by diſtinctions. <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> then is not to be offered as an inſtance. As to what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> alledges out of the Canon of the Maſs, I acknowledg it cannot be concluded thence that the Prieſts of the Roman Church in our times do not believe Tranſubſtantiation, becauſe as I have already ſaid, it clearly appearing elſewhere that they believe it, we muſt not judg of the terms of the Canon according to their natural ſenſe. But a man may conclude thence that thoſe who at firſt made this Liturgy, had not the ſame belief with thoſe at this day; for they ſpake then naturally, and according to the common belief of their Church: Now it is certain that on the Principle of Tranſubſtantiation one muſt deſire of God not that the Bread <hi>be made</hi> to us the Body of his Son, but that it be made the Body of his Son abſolutely. There is a great deal of difference between theſe two, for if the Bread be tranſubſtantiated <hi>it is made</hi> the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in it ſelf, to all reſpects, and beyond all reſpects; but if it be only <hi>made to us</hi> the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, it is made ſo only in our reſpect, which is to ſay that 'tis to us inſtead of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and communicates the virtue and efficacy of it. 'Tis in this ſenſe that the Faithful ſay in the 84. <hi>Pſalm, That God is to 'em a Sun and a Shield.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> in the 119. <hi>Pſalm, That the Statutes of God have been to him as ſo many muſical ſongs.</hi> And in the 41. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> according to the vulgar Tranſlation, <hi>Fuerunt mihi lachrymoe panis die ac nocte.</hi> This way of ſpeaking is very uſual amongſt the Latins, as appears by theſe examples of <hi>Virgil, Erit iſta mihi genetrix, eris mihi magnus Apollo, erit ille mihi ſemper Deus, Mens ſua cuique Deus, Dextra mihi Deus.</hi> And ſo far concerning <hi>Florus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>WE muſt now paſs on to <hi>Remy</hi> of <hi>Auxerre,</hi> to whom as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 8. ch. 7. page 824.</note> ſays, <hi>is attributed not only the Expoſition of the Maſs which goes under his name, but alſo the Commentary of S.</hi> Paul, <hi>which others refer to</hi> Haymus <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of</hi> Alberſtat. They that will take the pains to examin the Doctrin of this Author, not in the declamations of Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> but in the paſſages themſelves, wherein 'tis found explain'd, will ſoon find that he held the Opinion of <hi>Damaſcen</hi> and the Greeks, which is the union of the Bread with the Divinity, and by the Divinity to the natural Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and that by means of this union, or conjunction, the Bread becomes the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and is made one and the ſame Body with him. Which does manifeſtly appear by what I have related of it in my Anſwer to the <hi>Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity. The Fleſh,</hi> ſays he, <hi>which the Word has taken in the Womb of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Comment. in 1 Cor. 10.</note> 
                           <hi>in unity of perſon, and the Bread which is conſecrated in the Church, are the ſame Body of Chriſt. For as this Fleſh is the Body of Chriſt, ſo this Bread paſſes to the Body of Chriſt, and theſe are not two Bodies, but one Body. For the fulneſs of the Divinity which was in that Body, fills likewiſe this Bread, and the ſame Divinity of the Word which is in them, fills the Body of Chriſt which is conſecrated by the Miniſtry of ſeveral Prieſts throughout the whole world, and makes it one only Body of Chriſt.</hi> He does not ſay as <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> that 'tis <hi>entirely the ſame Fleſh born of the Virgin, dead and riſen,</hi> nor that 'tis the ſame Fleſh, <hi>becauſe it</hi> pullules, or multiplies: But he makes of this Fleſh, and Bread, the ſame Body by an unity of union; becauſe that the ſame Divinity which fills the Fleſh, fills likewiſe this Bread. And elſewhere, <hi>Altho this Bread be broken in pieces, and Conſecrated all over the world, yet</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid. in c. 11.</note> 
                           <hi>the Divinity which fills all things, fills it alſo, and makes it become one only Body of Chriſt.</hi> It lying upon him to give a reaſon why ſeveral parts of the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:41961:315"/> ſame Bread, and ſeveral loaves conſecrated in divers places were only one Body of Jeſus Chriſt, there was nothing more eaſie than to ſay on the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis of Tranſubſtantiation that 'twas one and the ſame numerical ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, exiſting wholly entire under the ſpecies in each part, and on every Altar where the Conſecration is perform'd. But inſtead of this he falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on enquiries into the reaſon of this unity in the Divinity which fills both all the Loaves of the Altars, and all the parts of a Loaf. Again in another place, <hi>As the Divinity of the Word which fills the whole world is one, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">In Expoſit. Can.</note> 
                           <hi>this Body be Conſecrated in ſeveral places, and at infinitely different times, yet is not this ſeveral Bodies, nor ſeveral Bloods, but one only Body, and one only Blood, with that which he took from the Virgin, and which he gave to the Apoſtles. For the Divinity fills it, and JOYNS it to it ſelf, AND MAKES THAT AS IT IS ONE, SO IT BE JOYN'D TO THE BODY OF CHRIST, and is one only Body of Chriſt in truth.</hi> To ſay ſtill after this that the Doctrin of <hi>Remy</hi> is not that this Bread is one with the natural Body of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe 'tis joyn'd with it, and that 'tis joyn'd with it, becauſe one and the ſame Divinity fills them, this is methinks for a man to wilfully blind himſelf, ſeeing <hi>Remus</hi> ſays it in ſo many words. He teaches the ſame thing a little further in another place, <hi>As the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt which he took of the Virgin is his true Body which was put to death for our Salvation, ſo the Bread which Jeſus Chriſt gave to his Diſciples, and to all the Elect, and which the Prieſts Conſecrate every day in the Church, with the virtue of the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which fills it, is the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt; and this Fleſh which he has taken, and this Bread are not two Bodies, but make but one only Body of Chriſt.</hi> We may find the ſame Doctrin in his Commentaries on the 10th. Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews. This Hoſt,</hi> ſays he, ſpeaking of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, <hi>is one and not many, as were the ancient ones. But how is it one and not many, ſeeing 'tis offered both by ſeveral perſons, and in ſeveral places, and at ſeveral times.</hi> A perſon that had the hypotheſis of Tranſubſtantiation in his mind, would not have ſtuck to ſay, that it is in all places and at all times one and the ſame numerical ſubſtance, the ſame Body which pullutes, or multiplies it ſelf, as <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> ſpeaks. Whereas <hi>Remy</hi> betakes himſelf to another courſe without mentioning a word, either of this unity of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or this pullulation. <hi>We muſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>carefully remark that 'tis the Divinity of the Word, which being one, filling all things, and being every where, cauſes theſe to be not ſeveral Sacrifices, but one, altho it be offered by many; and is one only Body of Chriſt with that which he took of the Virgin, and not ſeveral Bodies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IT cannot be denied but this Opinion of the unity of the Bread with the Body of Jeſus Chriſt by way of conjunction, and by means of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity which fills the one and the other, got ſome footing in the Latin Church, even ſince <hi>Damaſcen</hi>'s time. We find it in the Book of Divine Offices falſly attributed to <hi>Alcuinus,</hi> almoſt in the ſame terms wherein we have ſeen it in <hi>Remus;</hi> ſo that it ſeems that one of theſe Authors only co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied out from the other. <hi>As the Divinity of the Word,</hi> ſays this ſuppoſed <hi>Alcuinus, is one, who fills the whole world, ſo, altho this Body be Conſecrated</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Cap. 40.</note> 
                           <hi>in ſeveral places, and at an infinite number of times, yet are not theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bodies of Chriſt, nor ſeveral Cups, but one only Body of Chriſt, and one only Blood with that which he took of the Virgin, and which he gave to his Apoſtles. For the Divinity of the Word fills him who is every where</hi> (which is to ſay, that which is Conſecrated in ſeveral places) <hi>and makes, that as it is one, it be alſo joyn'd to the Body of Chriſt, and that it be but one only Body in truth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="235" facs="tcp:41961:315"/>
                        <p>WE find this ſame opinion in another Book of Divine Offices, which <note place="margin">Rupert lib. 2. de Divin. Off. cap. 2.</note> ſome attribute to <hi>Rupert,</hi> and others to <hi>Walramus, This Body which is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Altar, and that which is taken from the Virgin, are not ſaid to be, nor indeed are, two Bodies, becauſe one and the ſame Word is on high in the Fleſh, and here below in the Bread.</hi>

                        <p>IT is likewiſe very likely, that in the 11th. Century during the greateſt heats of the Diſpute of <hi>Lanfranc</hi> againſt <hi>Berenger,</hi> there were ſeveral adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of <hi>Berenger</hi> who followed this Opinion. Which may be manifeſtly collected from an argument which <hi>Lanfranc</hi> attributes to the <hi>Berengarians</hi> in theſe terms: <hi>If the Bread be changed into the true Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lanfran. de Corp. &amp; Sang. Dom.</note> 
                           <hi>either the Bread muſt be carried to Heaven to be changed there into the Fleſh of Chriſt, or the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt muſt deſcend on the Earth, to the end that the Bread may be changed into it. Now neither of theſe is done.</hi> This Argument neceſſarily ſuppoſes that the <hi>Berengarians</hi> did ſet themſelves againſt perſons, who thought the Bread was changed into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt by way of union and conjunction, or as ſpeaks <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> by way of <hi>addition,</hi> as the food is changed into our body. On this Hypotheſis they had ſome reaſon to ſay, that either the Body which is above muſt come down here below, or that the Bread which is here below muſt be carried above; for it does not ſeem immediately that the conjunction can be well made otherwiſe: But they could not have the leaſt reaſon, or likelihood of reaſon to form this objection againſt the Doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation in the manner wherein the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> underſtands it. For if the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bread be converted into the ſame numerical ſubſtance of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt which is in Heaven, the diſtance, or proximity of this Bread, and of this Body, make not this converſion, either more eaſie, or more difficult. Tho the Bread here below be carried up into Heaven, tho the Body of Jeſus Chriſt which is above in Heaven deſcends here below on Earth, this contributes nothing to the making of the one to be converted into the other. For the converſion of one ſubſtance into another, ſpeaks quite another thing than a kind of local motion, as is that of aſcending or deſcending. It is then evident that the opinion which the <hi>Berengarians</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed was that the Bread is made the Body of Jeſus Chriſt by way of union.</p>
                        <p>WE may moreover juſtifie the ſame thing by a paſſage of <hi>Aſcelinus,</hi> one of <hi>Berenger</hi>'s adverſaries; for obſerve here in what manner he explains his ſentiment in his Letter to <hi>Berenger</hi> himſelf, <hi>Neque vero mirari, vel diffidere</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">In notis d' A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheri in vitam Lanfr.</note> 
                           <hi>debemus Deum facere poſſe ut hoc quod in Altari conſecratur virtute Spiritus Sancti, &amp; miniſterio Sacerdotis, uniatur corpori illi quod ex Maria Virgine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptor noſter aſſumpſit, quippe utrumque ſubſtantia corporea, utrumque viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile, ſi reminiſcimur nos ipſos ex corporea, &amp; incorporea, ex mortali, &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortali ſubſtantia eſſe compactos, ſi denique firmiter credimus divinam huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namque naturam conveniſſe perſonam.

                        <p>IT is neceſſary to relate theſe paſſages to ſhew the Readers how greatly Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> deceives them when he would perſuade 'em that this opinion of the conjunction of the Bread with the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, by means of the ſame Divinity which fills them, is a chimera of the Miniſters invention. It appears on the contrary that 'tis a ſentiment which has been in effect held by divers Authors in the Latin Church, not to mention here that 'tis the Doctrin of <hi>Damaſcen</hi> and the Greeks which have followed him. And this is the firſt concluſion which can be drawn hence; but from hence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo follow ſeveral other moſt important matters. For firſt, by this we ſee that the ſentiment of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> was not that of the Church of his time, as ſome would perſuade us, ſeeing thoſe very Authors which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> alledges in his favour, and who ſeem to come the neareſt to <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his expreſſions, are at bottom, and in effect infinitely diſtant from his Doctrin. Secondly, Hence it appears there was nothing regular in the Latin Church touching Tranſubſtantiation, neither in the 11th. nor 12th. Century, ſeeing conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Authors then publickly explain'd their belief concerning the Euchariſt in a manner which ſuffers the Bread and Wine to ſubſiſt in their firſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. In the third place, from hence is apparent how little certainty and confidence a rational man can put in the principle of the Author of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity</hi> and Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> who ſuppoſe it as a thing certain, that in the time when <hi>Berenger</hi> was firſt condemned, that is to ſay in the year 1053. the whole Latin Church was united in the Faith of the Real Preſence, and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, ſeeing the contrary may be juſtifi'd, as well by the argument which <hi>Lanfranc</hi> relates of the <hi>Berengarians,</hi> as by the paſſage of <hi>Aſcelinus.</hi> In fine, it may be ſeen here how frivolous and vain Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s negative arguments be, who would prove that the Greeks believ'd in the 11th. Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury Tranſubſtantiation, becauſe they did not take <hi>Berengarius</hi> his part, nor diſputed on this Article againſt the Latins. For if Tranſubſtantiation was not then determin'd in the Latin Church, if one might therein make a free profeſſion to believe the union of the Bread with the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, by means of the Divinity, as appears from the example of <hi>Aſceli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Berenger</hi>'s great Adverſary, what reaſon could the Greeks have to diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pute and make oppoſitions?</p>
                        <p>IT ſignifies nothing for Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to raiſe objections againſt the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of theſe Authors whom I laſt mention'd; and to ſay, <hi>that if the ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bitation</hi>

                           <hi>of the Divinity in the Body of Jeſus Chriſt remaining in Heaven, and in the Bread remaining on Earth, and conſerving its nature, and the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this Bread to ſerve for an inſtrument to communicate the graces me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited by the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, rendred the Bread the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; the ſame habitation of the Divinity in the Water of Baptiſm, and the uſe which God makes of it to communicate his graces, would render it likewiſe the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and give occaſion to ſay, that altho there be different Waters to Baptize in, yet theſe Waters make but one and the ſame Body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, that they are changed into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, that they paſs into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, that altho they appear to be Water, yet in truth they are the Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Beſides that it does not follow that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have not had a ſentiment, that one may form objections to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, there being no opinion ſo clear againſt which we may not raiſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. One may moreover anſwer him from the part of <hi>Remy</hi> and others, that the habitation of the Divinity does not always produce this effect in all the material things which it makes uſe of whereby to communicate the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:41961:316"/> graces merited by the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, to unite them to the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and to make them become this Body by way of conjunction and addition. 'Tis an habitation and a particular union of the Divinity to the Bread of the Euchariſt which produces in it alone this effect, which muſt not be extended to other things which Jeſus Chriſt did not ſay were <hi>his Body,</hi> as he ſaid of the Bread. All that can be hence concluded then is that according to theſe Authors there muſt be ſome difference allowed between the habitation of the Divinity in the Bread, and the habitation of this ſame Divinity in other things, as there is between the habitation of the Divinity in the Faithful and Saints; and the habitation of this ſame Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the human nature of Jeſus Chriſt, ſeeing this difference appears in the difference of the effects which they produce. Now this is a thing which theſe Authors would gladly allow. One may ſay the ſame thing touching the Soul and Body of Jeſus Chriſt, which are filled with the ſame virtue of the Divinity, and yet of which it cannot be ſaid that one is the other. For altho the ſame Divinity dwells in the Body, and Soul of Jeſus Chriſt, yet this is another kind of habitation, deſign'd to produce not the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd effect, but another. The Divinity dwells in all things, and fills them with its virtue, but in a different manner, and this difference diſcovers it ſelf only by the difference of the effects which it produces in the things themſelves.</p>
                        <p>THIS is near what theſe Authors would have anſwer'd had any body offered them theſe objections. But I am perſuaded they would never have approved of this new Philoſophy, by which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> endeavours to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate their expreſſions to the ſenſe of the Roman Tranſubſtantiation. <hi>Remy,</hi> ſays he, <hi>tells us that the Divinity which is in the Body of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">P. 832.</note> 
                           <hi>and in the Bread joyns them together, but not by a ſimple habitation; for it would thus joyn all the creatures where it reſides, but by a true operation which renders them not diſtant, but immediately united. And this union does not determin it ſelf to a ſimple conjunction, but makes that the Bread paſſes into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, that it becomes the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, as wax becomes fire, according to the compariſon of S.</hi> Chryſoſtom <hi>and as the Bread eaten by Jeſus Chriſt became the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, according to the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of other Fathers. This union then is only the way to Tranſubſtantiation. Remy</hi> and other Authors who have followed this opinion, explain the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how the Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and they ſay that 'tis inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as 'tis joyn'd to this Body. <hi>'Tis,</hi> ſays <hi>Remy, one only Body and Blood with that which he took of the Virgin, for the Divinity fills it, and joyns it to it ſelf, and makes that as it is one, ſo it muſt be joyn'd to the Body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and be one Body of Jeſus Chriſt in truth. The Divinity of the Word</hi> (ſays the pretended <hi>Alcuinus) fills this Body which is every where,</hi> (which is to ſay, that which is Conſecrated in an infinite of places) <hi>adding it to ſelf, and makes that as it is one, it be alſo joyn'd to the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and be one only Body in truth.</hi> Theſe words do not put us upon imagining they thought of laying open a certain way to Tranſubſtantiation, nor a pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulatory or preparative union to the converſion, as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would have us believe. This is a mere illuſion. 'Tis clear they teach in what manner the Bread is the ſame Body with that which he took of the Virgin, and ſettle here, to wit, inaſmuch as 'tis joyn'd to it by the link of the ſame Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which fills both the one and the other. Which is what appears from the bare reading of their paſſages, and eſpecially that of <hi>Aſcelinus. Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> had told him, that <hi>if he follow'd the opinion of</hi> Paſchaſus, <hi>he went con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:41961:317"/> to all the laws of nature.</hi> And <hi>Aſcelinus</hi> anſwers him <hi>that 'tis neither a ſubject of admiration, nor a ſubject of doubt that God can make that which is Conſecrated on the Altar to be united to this Body which our Saviour took of the Virgin;</hi> which ſhews he made the ground of his ſentiment to conſiſt in this union; and that he reſpected it not as a way to Tranſubſtantiation, but as that which formally made the Bread the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples which he adds of the Soul and Body which are joyned together and of the two natures united in Jeſus Chriſt confirm the ſame thing; for the union of the ſoul and body, and the union of the two natures are not in any wiſe ways, and preparations to any Tranſubſtantiation; they are on the contrary unions, wherein the two things united ſubſiſt, and on which the mind ſettles. What Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſays, that this union does not termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate it ſelf to a ſimple conjunction, but makes the Bread paſs into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, is equivocal. For if he means that the formal effect of this union is, that the Bread remaining what it was, becomes the Body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, we will grant him, that this was in effect the ſentiment of theſe Authors; but if he'll have the Bread, ceaſing to be what it was, to become really the ſame numerical ſubſtance which was the Body of Chriſt before this change, we deny that theſe Authors have taken it in this ſort. The compariſons which he alledges of Wax which becomes Fire, and Bread eaten by Chriſt which became his Body do contradict this laſt ſenſe; for the Wax devoured by the Fire becomes not the ſame ſubſtance of Fire in number that it was before; and the Bread which our Saviour aet became not likewiſe ſo properly the ſame ſubſtance in number, which was before his Body. So what he ſays afterwards, <hi>That to joyn the Bread to the Body of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">p. 842.</note> 
                           <hi>and to make it to be the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and paſs into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, ſignifies to tranſubſtantiate in all the languages of the world,</hi> is a matter ill offered and evidently unjuſtifiable. For if the Bread becomes the Body of Jeſus Chriſt formally by reaſon of the union, as the ſenſe of theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors is, in the ſame manner as the food we receive becomes our body by the union which it has with it, it is made the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, not by any real converſion into this ſame ſubſtance of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt which was before, but it becomes it by way of addition to this ſubſtance, or according to the preciſe explication which <hi>Damaſcen</hi> gives of it by way of augmentation and growth of the natural Body of Jeſus Chriſt, as we have already ſeen in the third Book, when we treated of the opinion of the Greeks.</p>
                        <p>THIS being thus clear'd up, 'tis no hard matter to anſwer the paſſages of <hi>Remy,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> alledges with ſo great confidence, <hi>Seeing that a</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Page 832. Book 8. ch. 7.</note> 
                           <hi>myſtery,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is that which ſignifies another thing, if it be the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in truth, why call we it a myſtery, 'Tis becauſe that after the Conſecration it is one thing, and it appears another. It appears to be Bread and Wine, but 'tis in truth the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. For God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating himſelf to our weakneſs, ſeeing we are not uſed to eat raw Fleſh, and drink Blood, makes theſe gifts remain in their firſt form, altho they be in truth the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> I anſwer that <hi>Remy</hi> means that the gifts appear to be after the Conſecration what they were before; to wit, ſimple Bread and Wine, that the change which they have received, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing become the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, by their union with the natural Body, is an inviſible thing, and that this union does not change any thing of their firſt form, altho it ſeems it ſhould do it ſeeing the Bread which our Saviour aet, and which became likewiſe his Body by union, took the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:41961:317"/> form of Fleſh. That God deals otherwiſe in the Euchariſt by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention to our weakneſs, becauſe we cannot ſuffer this form of Fleſh, but yet the union ceaſes not to be true, and conſequently the Bread is in truth the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, altho it does not appear to be ſo. This is the true ſenſe of <hi>Remy</hi> grounded on his own Hypotheſis, and not that which Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> imputes to him.</p>
                        <p>THE ſecond paſſage as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> alledges it, is conceived in theſe terms, <hi>As the Divinity of the Word is one which fills all the world, ſo altho the Body be conſecrated in ſeveral places, and at infinitely different times, yet this is not ſeveral Bodies of Jeſus Chriſt, nor ſeveral Cups, but the ſame Body and the ſame Blood, with that which he took in the Virgins Womb; and which he gave to his Apoſtles. And therefore we muſt obſerve that whether we take more, or leſs, all do equally receive the Body of Jeſus Chriſt entire.</hi> But firſt I demand of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> who gave him that liberty to retrench from this paſſage a whole ſentence, to alledg what goes before, and what follows, and leave out a whole period in the middle, without any other reaſon than that it ſolves the difficulty, and clearly ſhews <hi>Remy</hi>'s ſenſe? Is it fairly done in theſe kind of diſputes to maim paſſages of Authors which do not make for us? Moreover were it ſome words either before or after, we might perhaps ſuppoſe in his favour, that 'twere only an omiſſion, or neglect, and that he did not mind that what he left out belonged to the ſame paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, but to retrench a whole ſentence from the middle of a diſcourſe, is I think a thing without example. Here then is what <hi>Remy</hi> ſays, <hi>'Tis one and the ſame Body, and the ſame Blood with that which he took in the Womb of the Virgin, and which he gave to his Apoſtles. FOR THE DIVINITY FILLS IT, AND JOINS IT TO IT SELF, AND MAKES, THAT AS IT IS ONE, IT BE LIKEWISE JOIN'D TO THE BODY OF JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST, AND THAT IT BE ONE ONLY BODY IN THE TR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TH.</hi> This period eclips'd leaves all the reſt of the paſſage favourable to Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> and therefore he has thought fitting to lay it aſide accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the liberty which he allows himſelf of removing whatſoever offends him; but this ſame period re-eſtabliſh'd ſhews clearly the ſenſe of <hi>Remy,</hi> which is, that all the Loaves conſecrated in ſeveral places are one and the ſame Body of Jeſus Chriſt with that which he took of the Virgin, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are tranſubſtantiated into it, but becauſe they are <hi>joyn'd</hi> with it by means of the Divinity which is one in all theſe Loaves.</p>
                        <p>THE third paſſage has theſe words, <hi>That as the Fleſh which Jeſus Chriſt has taken in the Womb of the Virgin, is his true Body crucified for our ſalvation, ſo this Bread which Jeſus Chriſt has given to his Diſciples and to all thoſe which are predeſtinated to eternal life, and which the Prieſts conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate every day in the Church,</hi> WITH THE VIRTUE OF THE DIVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NITY WHICH FILLS THIS BREAD, <hi>is the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt. And this Fleſh which he has taken, and this Bread are not two Bodies, but make one only true Body of Jeſus Chriſt, ſo that when this Bread is broken and eaten, Jeſus Chriſt is ſacrificed and eaten, and yet remains entire and living. And as this Body which he depoſed on the Croſs was offered for our Redemption, ſo this Bread is offered every day to God for our Salvation and Redemption, which altho it appears to be Bread, is yet the Body of Chriſt. For our Redeemer having regard to our weakneſs, and ſeeing us ſubject to ſin, has given us this Sacrament, to the end that being now incapable of dying, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho we ſin every day, we may have a true Sacrifice by which our iniquities may</hi>
                           <pb n="240" facs="tcp:41961:318"/> 
                           <hi>be expiated. And becauſe all theſe Loaves make but one Body of Jeſus Chriſt and are offered for our Redemption, he has ſaid, This is my Body which ſhall be given for you, and added, do this, which is to ſay, Conſecrate this Body, in remembrance of me, to wit, of my Paſſion, and your Redemption, for I have redeemed you by my Blood. Our Lord leaving this bleſſed Sacrament to all his faithful ſervants to engrave it in their hearts and memories has done like a man who drawing near the time of his death, ſends to his friends a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for a remembrance of him, ſaying, Receive this gift, my dear friend, and keep it carefully for my ſake, to the end that every time you ſee it, you may think on me.</hi> There is nothing in all this but what may very well agree with the Hypotheſis of <hi>Remy,</hi> that the Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt by way of union and conjunction with the natural Body. This Bread <hi>with the virtue of the Divinity which fills it, is the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> becauſe an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition made to the natural Body becomes the true Body. And theſe are not two Bodies but one only Body, becauſe that according to the argument of <hi>Damaſcen</hi> an augmentation or a growth of a Body does not make another, but the ſame Body. When this Bread is broken and eaten, Jeſus Chriſt is immolated and eaten, to wit, in this Bread which is joyn'd to him, and yet he remains entire and living, to wit, in his natural Body. This Bread is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for our Redemption, inaſmuch as 'tis a commemoration of it, and an application made to us of the price of our Redemption on the Croſs. And in this ſenſe 'tis a true Sacrifice which expiates us becauſe it does repreſent and apply to us the true Sacrifice of the Croſs of Jeſus Chriſt, as <hi>Remy</hi> thereupon formally explains himſelf in theſe words, <hi>Do this, that is to ſay, Conſecrate this Body in remembrance of me, to wit, of my Paſſion and your Redemption, for I have redeemed you by my Blood.</hi> Here are the objections which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has made on <hi>Remy,</hi> let any one judg whether he has had reaſon to make ſuch a buſtle with this Author and ſay, <hi>That it appears ſtrange any man ſhould queſtion the ſentiment of an Author which ſpeaks in this ſort. For in fine; a body would think the licenſe of contradicting every thing ſhould have its bounds.</hi> 'Twere well if Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would accuſtom himſelf to judg of things with leſs prejudice.</p>
                        <p>WE muſt now paſs on to <hi>Chriſtian Drutmar,</hi> of whom I had alledged a very conſiderable paſſage taken from his Commentary on the 26. Chapter of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> that is to ſay, from an explication which he makes preciſely of th' inſtitution of the Holy Sacrament. The Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> had cavil'd on this paſſage as much as 'tis poſſible, ſometimes ſaying that the tranſlation which I made of it was not faithful, ſometimes that the Text it ſelf was corrupted, ſometimes that the words of which it conſiſts had no coherence, ſometimes that the paſſage was queſtion'd by <hi>Sixtus</hi> of <hi>Sienne,</hi> and that there was a Manuſcript of <hi>Drutmar</hi> in the Convent of Grey-Friers at <hi>Lyons</hi> which inſtead of this explication, <hi>Hoc eſt Corpus meum. Id eſt in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramento,</hi> contain'd theſe words, <hi>Hoc eſt Corpus meum.

He only tells us that <hi>'tis the direct attention to the Sacrament, and external vail which makes</hi> Drutmar <hi>to explain theſe words; Hoc eſt Corpus meum,</hi> by theſe, <hi>id eſt in Sacramento. For when a man directs his mind to the Sacrament, and that</hi>

                           <hi>which ſtrikes our ſenſes, one cannot ſay ſtrictly that 'tis the Body it ſelf of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. It is apparent Bread, 'tis the ſign, the ſimilitude, the Sacrament of this Body which is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt only in Sacrament, as</hi> Drutmar

                           <hi>ſays. This is not the point in queſtion. But the queſtion is to know in what ſort the people of thoſe days believed the Body of Jeſus Chriſt was joyn'd to this Sacrament and Vail. 'Tis by this we muſt ſupply</hi> Drutmar'<hi>s expreſſion; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more unjuſt than to judg of his ſentiment by a word which he ſpake curſorily, and by an abridged expreſſion.</hi>

                        <p>IT muſt be acknowledg'd no eaſie matter to ſound the bottom of theſe Gentlemens minds; who ever could imagin that after ſo many attempts to elude the paſſage of <hi>Drutmar,</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> finding his labour in vain ſhould betake himſelf to the <hi>direction of attention? Drutmar</hi> writes an expreſs Commentary on the inſtitution of the Euchariſt. He explains theſe words of our Saviour, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> in this ſenſe, <hi>that is to ſay Sacramentally.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> comes and tells us by his own Authority <hi>that he minded directly only the vail and appearances of Bread which cover the Body of Chriſt;</hi> as if <hi>Drutmar</hi> did not deſign to give the true ſenſe of our Saviour in the explication of theſe words, or as if our Saviour meant only by theſe words that the appearances of Bread ſignifie his Body; or as if a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator were not obliged to direct his attention to the principal, natural and eſſential ſenſe of the words he explains, without falling into forein and fantaſtical ſenſes which no body could imagin but himſelf. For I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it has ever yet entred into any man's thoughts that theſe terms, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> ſignifie, <hi>that the accidents of Bread, or the vail of the appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Bread which cover the Body of Jeſus Chriſt are this Body only in ſign and Sacrament.</hi> Neither muſt Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> tell us that this is a word which <hi>Drutmar</hi> ſpake <hi>tranſiently and for brevity ſake;</hi> for 'tis an expreſs and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal explication of our Saviours words. Suppoſing people commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved Tranſubſtantiation and the Real Preſence, as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would have it, what likelihood is there that in an age wherein people could not be ignorant, that this Doctrin met with much contradiction in the perſon of <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> that <hi>Drutmar</hi> (who was a Religious of the Convent of <hi>Corbie,</hi> which is to ſay of the ſame Convent as <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> was Abbot of) would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the world, betray the publick Faith of the Church, favour thoſe that oppoſed it, ſcandalize his own proper party, and give way to an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical explication of Chriſts words, and this by the rule of <hi>direct attention,</hi> and by the means of <hi>abbreviated expreſſions.</hi> In truth Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſhews what kind of opinion he has of us, when he ſuppoſes ſuch kind of anſwers as theſe will ſatisfie us.</p>

                              <hi>Of other Authors in the Ninth Century,</hi> Amalarius, Heribald, Raban, Bertram, <hi>and</hi> John Scot.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>AFter <hi>Drutmar,</hi> we muſt examin <hi>Amalarius.</hi> If we believe what <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew du Val</hi> the Sorboniſt Doctor ſays of him in his Notes on the Treatiſe of the Church of <hi>Lyons,</hi> entituled, <hi>De tribus Epiſtolis,</hi> the queſtion will be ſoon decided. For having related on the teſtimony of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> a paſſage of <hi>Amalarius</hi> he concludes in theſe terms, <hi>Ex quo conjecturae locus relinquitur Amalarium iſtum una cum Joanne Scoto fuiſſe Berengarii prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſores &amp; veluti ante ſignanos, Hence we may conjecture that this</hi> Amalarius, <hi>with</hi> John Scot <hi>were</hi> Berenger'<hi>s fore-runners.</hi> If we believe <hi>M.</hi> the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Maugin, Amalarius</hi> was only a Stercoraniſt, of whom we ſhall ſpeak hereafter. If we will believe the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity, Amalarius</hi> was <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Adverſary; for he ſtrongly aſſures us, <hi>That Biſhop</hi> Uſher <hi>was</hi>

                           <hi>miſtaken when he thought</hi> Amalarius'<hi>s error conſiſted in holding the Doctrin of the Roman Catholicks, not only becauſe this ſuppoſition is without any ground, but alſo becauſe the Epitomy of</hi> William <hi>of</hi> Malmsury <hi>joyns</hi> Amala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius <hi>with</hi> Heribald <hi>and</hi> Raban <hi>who were</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>his Adverſaries.</hi> But in ſhort, if we will conſult Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> he will tell us on the contrary, <note place="margin">Book 8. ch. 11. Page 870.</note> 
                           <hi>that</hi> Amalarius <hi>and</hi> Heribald <hi>were in no wiſe adverſaries to</hi> Paſchaſus. <hi>That the Author of the</hi> Perpetuity <hi>granted it becauſe he believed</hi> William <hi>of</hi> Malmsbury <hi>ſaid it, but that this does not appear to be true. That</hi> Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larius <hi>indeed was a Sterconariſt, but yet never any body taught more expreſly the Real Preſence.</hi> Thus theſe Gentlemen, who ſo greatly inſult over us, when they find any difference amongſt us Miniſters in the leaſt point of Hiſtory, or conjecture, do not always agree among themſelves, one ſays, <hi>Amalarius</hi> was the fore-runner of <hi>Berenger,</hi> the other maintains that never any man taught more formally the Real Preſence; the one makes him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Heribald</hi> and <hi>Raban</hi> a bitter enemy to <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> and th'other proteſts 'tis not likely to be true.</p>
                        <p>TO clear up this confuſion, we muſt have recourſe to the paſſages of <hi>Amalarius,</hi> and judg of his Doctrin from it ſelf. He tells us then firſt, <hi>That thoſe things which are done in the celebration of the Maſs, are tranſacted</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Praeſat. ad lib. de Offic. Eccl.</note> 
                           <hi>as in a Sacrament of our Lords Paſſion, as he himſelf commands us, ſaying, Every time you do this, do it in remembrance of me; and therefore the Prieſt who immolates the Bread and Wine, is in Sacrament of Chriſt, the Bread, the Wine and Water and Wine are for Sacraments of the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt. The Sacraments muſt have ſome reſemblance with the things of which they be Sacraments. Let the Prieſt then be like our Saviour Chriſt, as the Bread, the Wine and Liquors are like the Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It appears from theſe words, that in the ſtile of <hi>Amalarius,</hi> to be a <hi>Sacrament</hi> of a thing is to repreſent it, and hold the place of it, for this is preciſely what theſe terms ſignifie, <hi>The things of the Maſs are done IN SACRAMENT of our Lords Paſſion,</hi> and theſe other terms, <hi>the Prieſt is in Sacrament of Chriſt.</hi> When then he adds, <hi>that the Bread, the Wine and Water are in SACRAMENT of the Fleſh and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> it is clear he means they ſtand in ſtead of it, and repreſent them, and this reſemblance which
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:41961:319"/> he inſerts afterwards between the Bread, the Wine and the Water, and the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe they are the Sacraments of 'em, confirm the ſame thing, and at the ſame time formally diſtinguiſhes them from the Body and Blood themſelves.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D</hi> anſwers that <hi>Amalarius has follow'd the language of</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 8. ch. 4. p. 783.</note> 
                           <hi>ſenſe, and that the queſtion here was not to explain the nature of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, but the myſterious references which God would engrave in the ſymbols which he has choſen in this myſtery.</hi> But what reaſon has Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to make <hi>Amalarius</hi> to have follow'd the language of ſenſe in oppoſition to that of Faith, ſeeing <hi>Amalarius</hi> does not mention any thing that leads to this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, and that on the contrary it appears by the terms which he makes uſe of, that he honeſtly meant the Euchariſt was real Bread and Wine in ſubſtance. Who told Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> that <hi>Amalarius</hi> made not the nature of the Euchariſt to conſiſt in the whole action's being a Sacrament of our Lords Paſſion, that the Prieſt immolates the Bread and Wine, that he repreſents therein our Saviour Chriſt, and that the Bread and Wine ſtand for his Body and Blood? We muſt judg of <hi>Amalarius</hi> his Doctrin by his expreſſions. <hi>To be in Sacrament,</hi> according to him, is to repreſent and ſtand for, the Bread and Wine are in <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the Body and Blood, as the Prieſt is in <hi>Sacrament</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, they are not then really this Body and Blood.</p>

Hoc quod vice Chriſti immolatum eſt Deo patri commendat.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſays this is not an expreſſion contrary to the Real Preſence, becauſe <hi>Agapius</hi> has made uſe of it, and that in effect this expreſſion is grounded <hi>on the different</hi> ſtate wherein Jeſus Chriſt is in the Euchariſt, <hi>and that wherein he has been in his Paſſion, and that wherein he now is in Heaven. For this diverſity diſtinguiſhing him to our ſenſes, it makes one diſtinguiſh him likewiſe in the expreſſions,</hi> But all this is but a mere evaſion, <hi>Amalarius</hi> does not ſay that Jeſus Chriſt in one ſtate, holds the place of himſelf in another ſtate. He ingenuouſly ſays, <hi>that which is immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the ſtead of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and if you would know what he means by what is immolated in the place of Jeſus Chriſt, he has already told you that 'tis <hi>Bread and Wine which are immolated,</hi> and which are in <hi>Sacrament of the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>HE ſays moreover the ſame thing elſewhere, <hi>The Oblation and the Cup</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Lib. 3. de Off. cap. 26.</note> 
                           <hi>ſignifie our Lords Body, and when Jeſus Chriſt has ſaid, This is the Cup of my Blood, he meant his Blood which was in his Body, as the Wine was in the Cup.</hi> And a little further, <hi>By this particle of the Oblation which the Prieſt puts in the Cup, he repreſents the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, which is riſen from the dead, by that which the Prieſt or the People eat, is repreſented this Body of Jeſus Chriſt, which is ſtill on the Earth</hi> (to wit his Church) <hi>and by that which remains on the Altar, is repreſented this other Body which is ſtill lying in the Sepulchre</hi> (to wit, the faithful dead.)</p>
                        <p>IT is in vain that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> oppoſes to theſe paſſages what the ſame <hi>Amalarius</hi> ſays, <hi>That the Church believes this Sacrament ought to be eaten by</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 8. ch. 4. p. 785.</note> 
                           <hi>men, becauſe ſhe believes 'tis our Lords Body and Blood, and that in eating it the Souls of the Faithful are fill'd with benediction.</hi> For 'tis true that the reaſon for which the Church recommends to the Faithful the eating of the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:41961:320"/> Euchariſt, is becauſe 'tis the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, this is not a matter in conteſt, the queſtion is only to know in what manner this is.</p>
                        <p>'TIS moreover in vain that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> urges theſe other words, <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                           <hi>naturam ſimplicem panis &amp; vini mixti verti in naturam rationabilem, ſcilicet Corporis &amp; Sanguinis Chriſti. We believe that the ſimple nature of Bread and Wine is changed into a reaſonable nature, to wit, of the Body and Blood of Chriſt.</hi> For his ſenſe is not that there's made a real converſion of one nature into another, but that there's made a myſtical converſion by which 'tis no longer mere Bread and Wine, but the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, or as himſelf ſays elſewhere ſeveral times the Sacrament of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>'TIS alſo no leſs in vain that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> endeavours to make advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of ſome terms of <hi>Amalarius</hi> his Letter to <hi>Guntard,</hi> which may be ſeen in <hi>Spicilege</hi>'s ſeventh Volume. <hi>Guntard</hi> was a young man that was ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd at his ſeeing <hi>Amalarius</hi> ſpitting without any ſcruple immediately after his receiving the Communion, <hi>Amalarius</hi> anſwers him that this was a thing natural and neceſſary to the <hi>preſervation of health,</hi> and that he thought he did nothing herein which caſt any diſhonor on the Body of Chriſt, that if he imagin'd he caſt out, in ſpitting, the Body of Chriſt, he was deceived. <hi>That he would ſay to him touching the Body of Jeſus Chriſt which we receive, what the Emperor</hi> Valentinian <hi>ſaid to his Army. 'Twas in your power to chooſe me Emperor, but now 'tis in mine to chooſe whom I pleaſe for my Collegue. 'Tis the ſame here, for 'tis your part to have a pure heart, and to beſeech God to give it you; but 'tis his to diſperſe his Body throughout our members, and veins, for our ſalvation. For 'tis he who in giving the Bread to his Apoſtles has ſaid, This is my Body which ſhall be given for you. His Body was on the Earth when he would, and it is there when he pleaſes; yea, after his Aſcenſion he has not diſdain'd to ſhew himſelf to S.</hi> Paul <hi>in the Temple of Jeruſalem which was on earth.</hi> His ſenſe is, that we ought not to trouble our ſelves about what becomes of the myſtical Body of Jeſus Chriſt which we receive in the Euchariſt, that 'tis our part to purifie our hearts, and his to give us his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the manner which he thinks fitting; becauſe 'twas he that ſaid of the Bread of the Euchariſt, that 'twas his Body. What he adds concerning his Body being on the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he ſays it not with reſpect to the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> imagins, but in reference to the right which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour has to make his Euchariſtical Body what he pleaſes. For 'tis an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument <hi>à pari</hi> (as we call it) by which he undertakes to prove that Jeſus Chriſt is the maſter of his Euchariſtical Body, as well as the maſter of his natural Body, having left it on Earth as long as he thought fitting, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Aſcenſion was not ſo taken up with his abode in Heaven, as not to ſhew himſelf to his Apoſtle in the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And this appears from the ſequel of his diſcourſe. <hi>I ſay this,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to the end that if thro ignorance, or without my conſent there ſhould proceed out of my mouth any part of the Lords Body, you may not believe preſently hereupon that I am void of Religion, and that I deſpiſe my Lords Body, or that this Body be carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any place where he would not have it come. Our Soul lives by this Body, as the Lord himſelf ſays, If you eat not the Fleſh of the Son of Man, nor drink his Blood, you have no life in you. If then this Body be our life, it will not loſe being ſeparated from us what it has in it ſelf, and what we receive from it. My Son, deſire your Prieſts to take heed they loſe not out of their hearts any of thoſe words which the Lord has ſpoken in the</hi>
                           <pb n="245" facs="tcp:41961:320"/> 
                           <hi>Goſpel, for they are likewiſe our Life, as well as the Conſecrated Bread.</hi> He means, that altho he caſts out of his mouth in ſpitting ſome part of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſtical Body, yet we muſt not believe this Body is carried to any place where our Saviour would not have it, or this Body being in this place lies ſtript of the advantage which it has to be the life of our ſouls, no more than the words of the Goſpel, which altho neglected, be yet alſo our life. What ſignifies this to the Real Preſence? Will not his diſcourſe be every whit as coherent and as well followed if we ſuppoſe that the conſecrated Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in Sacrament as he teaches elſewhere, as if we ſuppoſe it to be ſo in propriety of ſubſtance, which we believe that <hi>Amalarius</hi> never taught.</p>
                        <p>THE concluſion which he draws from all this is yet (if you will) leſs favourable to Mr. <hi>Arnaud. Thus,</hi> ſays he, <hi>having taken with an honeſt and faithful heart the Lords Body, I have nothing to do to diſpute whether it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibly carried up into Heaven, or reſerved in our Body till the day of Judgment, or whether exhaled up in the Air, or whether it flows from our Body with the Blood when our Veins be opened, or iſſues out thro the Pores, the Lord ſaying, Whatſoever enters by the mouth into the belly goes into Excrement.</hi> Which is to ſay, that it belongs not to us to make all theſe queſtions about the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe our Saviour does with it what he pleaſes. <hi>As to our parts,</hi> adds he, <hi>we ought only to have a care leſt we receive it with a</hi> Judas'<hi>s heart, leſt we deſpiſe it; but on the contrary diſcern it ſalutarily from other common aliments.</hi> I confeſs Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has ſome reaſon to conjecture hence that <hi>Amalarius</hi> was of the number of thoſe which they call Stercoraniſts, but on what ſide ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he turns himſelf, he cannot conclude he held the Real Preſence, and this very thing that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> believes <hi>Amalarius</hi> was a Stercoraniſt ought to convince him on the contrary that this Author did not believe the change or converſion of the ſubſtance in the Euchariſt.</p>
                        <p>HAD Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> conſulted the Letter of the ſame <hi>Amalarius</hi> to <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> which is within two pages of that which he wrote to <hi>Gruntard,</hi> he had ſeen that <hi>Amalarius</hi> expounds theſe words of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>This is the Cup of the New Teſtament in my Blood which is ſhed for you,</hi> in this manner, <hi>This Cup is a figure of my Body, in which is the Blood which ſhall iſſue from my ſide to accompliſh the ancient Law, and when 'tis ſpilt it ſhall be the New Teſtament, becauſe 'tis a new and innocent Blood, the Blood of the Man without Sin, which ſhall be ſpilt for the Redemption of Mankind.</hi> Explaining aftetwards what is ſaid in the Liturgy, <hi>Myſterium fidei: This Blood,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is called the myſtery of Faith, becauſe it profits to the Salvation and Eternal Life of him that believes himſelf Redeemed by this Blood, and makes himſelf an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator of our Lords Paſſion. And therefore the Lord ſays, If yee eat not the Fleſh of the Son of man, nor drink his Blood, yee will have no life in you. Which is to ſay, if ye partake not of my Paſſion, nor believe that I died for your ſalvation, yee will have no life in you. The myſtery is Faith,</hi> as S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> teaches in <hi>his Epiſtle to</hi> Boniface, <hi>as in ſome manner the Sacrament of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, the Sacrament of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt is the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, ſo the Sacrament of Faith is Faith.</hi> 'Tis plainly ſeen this is not the ſtile of a man that believed the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                        <p>BUT before we leave <hi>Amalarius,</hi> we muſt joyn him to <hi>Heribald</hi> and <hi>Raban,</hi> for they ſtand all three accuſed by ſeveral Authors with Stercora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:41961:321"/> which is to ſay, they believ'd that what we receive in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is digeſted and ſubject to the neceſſity of other food which paſſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Excrements. <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> in his epitomis'd Manuſcript, as the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> acknowledges, attributes to all three of 'em this opinion. The Preſident <hi>Maugin</hi> affirms the ſame thing of <hi>Amalarius,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſays his proofs be good. And the anonymous Author publiſh'd by <hi>Cellot</hi> the Jeſuit, attributes the ſame ſentiment to <hi>Heribald,</hi> and <hi>Raban,</hi> without any mention of <hi>Amalarius, Et his quidem,</hi> ſays he, <hi>qui dixerunt ſeceſſui obnoxium (quid nunquam antea auditum eſt) id eſt, Heribaldo Antiſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorenſi Epiſcopo qui turpiter propoſuit, &amp; Rabano Moguntino qui turpius aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſit, turpiſſime vero concluſit, ſuus ad reſpondendum locus ſervetur.

                           <hi>Waldenſis</hi> attributes it in like manner to <hi>Heribald</hi> and <hi>Raban, Heribaldus,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Altiſiodorenſis Epiſcopus &amp; Rabanus Moguntinus poſuerunt Euchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtoe Sacramentum obnoxium eſſe ſeceſſui.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> endeavours to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract <hi>Raban</hi> from this number, <hi>The ſingle teſtimony,</hi> ſays he, <hi>of an Author ſo little judicious as this anonymous, is not ſufficient to impute this ſentiment to</hi> Raban, <hi>there being elſewhere nothing in his works but what may receive a good ſenſe.</hi> But has he ſo ſoon forgotten what he himſelf wrote eight lines above. <hi>Raban is accuſed of the error of the Stercoraniſts by an anonymous Author, and by</hi> William <hi>of</hi> Malmsbury. This anonymous is not the only Author that gives this teſtimony, <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> aſſerts the ſame: why then does Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſay eight lines after, <hi>The ſingle teſtimony of this anonymous Author is not enough?</hi> If his ſingle teſtimony be not ſufficient that of <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> will confirm it; and if theſe two be not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, <hi>Thomas Waldenſis</hi> will give 'em his ſuffrage as I now mention'd. Even <hi>Raban</hi> himſelf ſufficiently explains his own ſentiment, without any need of other witneſſes; for obſerve here what he writes in his fifth Book, <hi>De naturis rerum; The Lord would have the Sacraments of his Body and Blood to be received by the mouths of the Faithful, and ſerve 'em for food (in paſtum eorum redigi,</hi> others read <hi>in partem eorum redigi) to the end this viſible effect ſhould repreſent the inviſible effect. For as material food nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes and ſtrengthens the Body, ſo the Word of God inwardly nouriſhes our ſouls.</hi> And in his Book of the inſtruction of Eccleſiaſticks, he formally <note place="margin">In inſtit. Cleric. c. 31.</note> teaches, <hi>that the Sacrament is taken with the mouth, reduced into nouriſhment for our Bodies, and converted or changed in us when we eat it.</hi> There is no explication can ſhift the force and conſequence of theſe terms.</p>
                        <p>THE queſtion is now whether the opinion of theſe perſons, who have been ſince odiouſly called by way of reproach Stercoraniſts, be conſiſtent with the Real Preſence, or whether it ſuppoſes that the ſubſtance of Bread remains in the Euchariſt.

                        <p>'TWILL be ſaid it hence plainly appears that the Berengarians were Stercoraniſts, ſeeing they believ'd that the ſubſtance of Bread remain'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Conſecration, but that it does not hence follow that all the Sterco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raniſts, and eſpecially <hi>Heribald</hi> and <hi>Raban</hi> held in like manner the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of the Bread and Wine. I anſwer, It belongs to Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to ſhew us that there were two ſorts of Stercoraniſts, the one who held the Real Preſence, and others that did not believe it. For why muſt we be led by his authority? we ſhow that thoſe who were accuſed of Stercoraniſm are the ſame as were oppoſed for not believing Tranſubſtantiation. If Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> will needs have that there were two ſorts, 'tis his part to prove it, for as long as he ſuppoſes this without proof, we have right to deny it him. Yet will it be no hard matter to convince him that this ſame Stercoraniſm which Authors attribute to <hi>Heribaid</hi> and <hi>Raban,</hi> is nothing elſe than the belief of the ſubſiſtence of the Bread and Wine in the Euchariſt, which is to ſay in a word that 'tis exactly the opinion of <hi>Berenger,</hi> and that 'twas only to render it odious that their adverſaries expoſed it under this idea, or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of Stercoraniſm. Which is what juſtifies it ſelf from the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Thomas Waldenſis,</hi> who tells us that a ſubtil Doctor of his time ſaid, <hi>We ſhould interrogate the Prieſts, whether they did not think that this thing</hi>

                           <hi>which they believ'd to be the Fleſh of Chriſt was taſted with ones bodily mouth, and whether being received into the ſtomach it went into the draught, according as, adds he, the vile Sect of the Heribaldiens and Lollards taught, for they ſay ALL, that this Bread which they imprudently call THE NAT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RAL BREAD, is the auguſt Sacrament and conſecrated Hoſt.</hi> Here I think we have the Heribaldiens who formally ſay that the Sacrament, the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Hoſt, which according to them paſſes into Excrements, is, <hi>The natural Bread.</hi> The aforeſaid <hi>Waldenſis</hi> diſputing in the ſequel againſt <hi>Wicliff,</hi> ſays, <note place="margin">Ibid. cap. 26.</note> that <hi>Wicliff</hi> proved that the Euchariſt was Bread <hi>by the experience of nature,</hi> becauſe a man may be fed with Hoſts. <hi>Whence,</hi> adds he, <hi>I conclude that as he admits the digeſtion of the Euchariſt, he muſt likewiſe grant that it paſſes into Excrements. And thus is he agreed with</hi> Heribald <hi>and</hi> Raban <hi>of</hi> Mayence, <hi>who have taught that the true Sacrament was ſubject to the caſualty of other food.</hi> 'Tis plain he puts no difference between the Stercoraniſm of theſe two Biſhops, and the ſubſiſtence of the Bread of <hi>Wicliff.</hi> Elſewhere he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo more clearly proves that <hi>Honorius</hi> of <hi>Autun</hi> believed that the ſubſtance of Bread remained, or as he ſpeaks, that he was of the Sect of the <hi>Panites,</hi> becauſe he alledges the paſſage of <hi>Raban,</hi> which bears that the Sacrament paſſes into our food. <hi>Et ipſe enim,</hi> ſays he, <hi>de ſecta Panitarum, Rabani ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum</hi>

                        <p>BUT if we will beſides the teſtimonies of theſe Authors hearken more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over unto reaſon, we ſhall find that there is nothing more inconſiſtent with the belief of the Real Preſence than this pretended error of the Stercoraniſts; and that thoſe who will have theſe two opinions agree together, have never well conſidered what they undertook to eſtabliſh. It is not poſſible to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Real Preſence of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in the Euchariſt, I mean of this ſame numerical ſubſtance which was born of the Virgin, and is now in Heaven, without believing at the ſame time that this ſubſtance is not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in it, palpable, viſible, extended, capable of being divided in the ſame manner as 'twas when our Lord converſed on Earth. 'Twill be the greateſt folly imaginable to impute to perſons that have eyes, and ſee the Euchariſt, and have ſome remains of common ſenſe to make therein exiſt this Body without making it therein exiſt inſenſible, indiviſible, impalpable after the manner of ſpirits, as they alſo do of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now with what likelihood can one make this opinion agree with that of Stercoraniſm, which aſſerts that this Body is digeſted into the ſtomach after the manner of other meats, that one part of it paſſes into our nouriſhment, and the other is ſubject to the common neceſſity of aliments. What is digeſted is touched by the ſubſtance of our ſtomach, penetrated by our natural heat, divided and ſeparated into ſeveral parts, reduced into Chyle, then into Blood, diſtributed thro all the ſeveral parts of our Body, and joyn'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to 'em, after it has been made like 'em, whilſt that which is moſt groſs and improper for our nouriſhment paſſes into Excrement. What like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood is there that perſons who are not bereft of their ſenſes can ſubject to theſe accidents, an indiviſible and inpalpable ſubſtance, which exiſts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of Spirits? Moreover they were not ignorant that the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Jeſus Chriſt is animated with its natural Soul, and that what paſſes into our nouriſhment is animated by ours, what a monſtrous opinion then is it to imagin that the ſame numerical Body can be at the ſame time anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with two Souls, with that of Jeſus Chriſt and ours, to be united hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatically to the Word, and hypoſtatically to us? On what hand ſoever we turn, 'tis certain that 'tis an inexpreſſible chimera to ſay that thoſe which were called Stercoraniſts believ'd the Real Preſence in the ſenſe which the Roman Church underſtands it. It muſt be acknowledged that they were <hi>Panites,</hi> as <hi>Thomas Waldenſis</hi> calls them, that is to ſay, they believ'd that the Euchariſt was a Real Subſtance of Bread. And ſeeing we ſhew'd that <hi>Amalarius, Heribald,</hi> and <hi>Raban</hi> were of the number of theſe pretended Stercoraniſts, it muſt be neceſſarily acknowledged that they were contrary to the Doctrin of <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> whence it evidently follows that this Doctrin was not commonly held in the Church then, as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> pretends it was. For theſe three great men held in it too conſiderable a rank to permit us to believe they were contrary to the publick Belief in a point ſo conſiderable, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> himſelf will not have us think thus of 'em. One of 'em, to wit, <hi>Amalarius,</hi> was ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> by the Emperor <hi>Lewis</hi> to ſeek the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonaries, as he himſelf teſtifies. The other, to wit, <hi>Heribald,</hi> was Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Auxerre,</hi> and reputed a Saint after his death, as appears from the Inſcription of his Sepulchre, <hi>Here lies the Body of S.</hi> Heribald; and the laſt, to wit, <hi>Raban,</hi> was Abbot of <hi>Fulde,</hi> and afterwards Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Mayence,</hi> accounted one of the moſt learned men of his Age, as appears by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Sixtus</hi> of <hi>Sienne.</hi>

                        <p>TO theſe three we muſt add <hi>Bertram,</hi> for it cannot be doubted but that he was alſo one of thoſe who were afterwards called Stercoraniſts, which is to ſay, he believ'd that this ſubſtance which we receive in the Sacrament was ſubject to digeſtion, and paſſed into our nouriſhment.

                        <p>THESE two laſt Authors, to wit, <hi>Raban</hi> and <hi>Bertram,</hi> beſides this Doctrin which is common to 'em with the reſt, have eſpecially this, that they have formally oppoſed the novelties of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> by publick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. Which is what appears by the teſtimony of the anonymous Author whoſe words we have already related; for he ſays in proper terms, that <hi>Raban</hi> and <hi>Ratram</hi> wrote againſt <hi>Paſchaſus;</hi> to wit, <hi>Raban</hi> a Letter to the Abbot <hi>Egilon,</hi> and <hi>Ratram</hi> a Book dedicated to King <hi>Charles,</hi> and that they defamed him for offering this propoſition, that what we receive from the Altar is nothing elſe but the ſame Fleſh which was born of the Virgin, and ſuffered on the Croſs, and roſe again from the Sepulchre, and is at this day offered for the ſins of the world.</p>
                        <p>

Suppoſing <hi>Raban</hi> did not name <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> it will not follow that he did not attack his Book; for a man may write againſt a Book, and yet not name the Author of it.

But we are not in theſe Circumſtances. The Doctrin of <hi>Raban</hi> agrees very well with that of other Authors, his Contemporaries; that of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> agrees with none of 'em.

It ſignifies nothing to ſay, <hi>that</hi> Raban <hi>was as other men are, as appears by one of his Letters which the Church of</hi> Lyons <hi>has refuted:</hi> for ſhould a man rigorouſly examin <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Writings, he will find more marks of human weakneſs than in thoſe of <hi>Raban:</hi> beſides that from this very thing that <hi>Raban</hi> had the Church of <hi>Lyons</hi> for his Adverſary, one may hence conclude, according to Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s way of reaſoning, that his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin on the Euchariſt differed not from that of his time; for otherwiſe 'tis likely that the Church of <hi>Lyons</hi> would not have ſpared him on ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Article: and yet inſtead of this we find on the contrary that when this Church her ſelf ſpake of the Euchariſt, it has been in terms which do not at all favour the Real Preſence. <hi>When our Saviour Chriſt,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>gave</hi>

                           <hi>him with this error, for it does not appear that any other Author, ſave the Anonymous, ſaw this Letter to</hi> Egilon, <hi>ſo that the only perſon that had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of it has condemned it. Raban</hi> did not keep this Letter ſecret, ſeeing he has himſelf made mention of it in his <hi>Penitentials,</hi> and ſays he did it againſt the error of thoſe who ſay that the Sacrament was the Real Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt born of the Virgin. Thoſe who ſaw not his Letter might eaſily comprehend by theſe words the ſubſtance of it, and for what end he deſign'd it, if they have not condemned it 'twas their fault. Yet do we not pretend to draw hence any great advantage. <hi>But moreover,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud, how many errors are there in Authors which have been never taken notice of by any perſon, nor reproached to thoſe that taught 'em? There are ſtrange inſtances of this, and here is one from amongſt the reſt which is ſingular in its kind.</hi> Photius <hi>teſtifies that</hi> Theodorus Moſpueſte <hi>wrote a Book againſt the Doctrin of Original Sin. Both Eaſt and Weſt have been as greatly animated againſt this Author as can be imagin'd. He was condemned even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Death in the fifth Council: There was never then any perſon to be leſs favoured than he. Yet we do not find that this Capital Error obſerved by</hi> Photius <hi>has been Animadverted by any Author of the 6th. Century in the very time when</hi> Theodorus <hi>was uſed with moſt ſeverity.</hi> We muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg with Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> that theſe kind of arguments by which we conclude that if a Doctrin has not been condemn'd by a Church, it follows that this Church has held it and approved it, are not convincing, and what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of <hi>Theodorus</hi> of <hi>Moſpueſte</hi> is a conſiderable argument of it. But it muſt alſo be granted that never man was more at variance with himſelf than Mr. <hi>Arnaud;</hi> for what he now ſaid overthrows the better part of his Book. Thoſe that have read it may remember that the greateſt part of his diſpute touching the Greeks is reduced to negative arguments, perfectly like unto thoſe which he now condemns. The Greeks, ſays he without ceaſing, have not condemned then Tranſubſtantiation of the Latins. Therefore they believed it with 'em. <hi>Cerularius</hi> did not concern himſelf at <hi>Berenger</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, he believed the Tranſubſtantiation. <hi>Humbert</hi> did not reproach the Greeks with their not believing the Real Preſence, and <hi>Nicetas</hi> did not reproach the Latins with their believing it; therefore they were agreed in this Article. We can ſcarcely meet with any thing elſe but theſe kind of concluſions in every page. He does the ſame on the ſubject of the other Schiſmatical Churches, he argues from the ſilence of the Emiſſaries, the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Popes, the ſilence of the Armenians, and that of the Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians and others.

And when the diſcourſe was about <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> and the Innovation which we charge him
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:41961:324"/> with, with what exaggerations has he not urged this argument, That <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſus</hi> was not publickly reprehended by any perſon for thirty years, was never puniſh'd, nor admoniſh'd that he offered a Doctrin contrary to the Church. Apply I pray you to this Rhetorick, what he ſays now of this great number of errors in Eccleſiaſtical Authors which have been never ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverted by any body, nor reproach'd to thoſe who have taught 'em. Add hereunto his example of <hi>Theodorus</hi> of <hi>Moſpueſte,</hi> and that of <hi>John Scot,</hi> of whom he ſays likewiſe afterwards, that it does not appear that theſe errors have been condemned by any Eccleſiaſtical Cenſure of that Age, and that of <hi>Raban;</hi> for he ſuppoſes he might have erred on the Euchariſt by a capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Error in denying the Real Preſence, and he affirms that in this caſe 'twill not be ſtrange that never any body reproach'd him with this Error: lay I ſay all this together, and make a reform on this ground of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Book, retrench whatſoever agrees not with this rule which he here gives us, and I am ſure you'l reduce his Volume into a leſs compaſs by half.</p>
                        <p>AFTER theſe firſt Anſwers with which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> was not perhaps <note place="margin">Page 876.</note> well ſatisfi'd, he hazards another, which is, that this propoſition, <hi>That the Sacrament of the Euchariſt is not the Real Body born of the Virgin, may have two ſenſes, the one that the external part of the Sacrament, which is to ſay the viſible vail is not really the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is not really white, round, and has not in it ſelf all theſe ſenſible acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents which appear to us; the other, that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is not really contain'd in the Sacrament.</hi> He pretends that <hi>Raban</hi> denied this propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only in the firſt ſenſe, and not in the ſecond. But this anſwer has neither ſincerity nor truth in it. Firſt, it confounds what ought neceſſarily to be diſtinguiſh'd. For 'tis not the ſame thing to believe that the viſible Vail, which is to ſay, the accidents of Bread, are really the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and to believe that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is white and round, and has in it ſelf all the ſenſible accidents which appear to us. There is a great deal of difference between theſe two, as any man may ſee. Suppoſing a man believed that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is white and round, 'twill not hence follow he muſt ſay that this whiteneſs and this roundneſs, which are the Vail which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſpeaks of, were really the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. In the ſecond place, I do not think that ever any body imagin'd that theſe ſenſible accidents of whiteneſs and roundneſs <hi>in abſtracto,</hi> as they term it, are really the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and whoſoever imputes to <hi>Raban</hi> the combating of this fancy, charges him with oppoſing ſuch an imagination as never yet entred into any bodies mind.</p>
                        <p>AS to the other propoſition, That the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is really white and round, as 'tis not cuſtomary to expreſs it in theſe terms, <hi>That the Euchariſt is the ſame Body which was born of the Virgin,</hi> ſo 'tis not uſual to refute it in theſe, <hi>That the Euchariſt is not the ſame Body which was born of the Virgin;</hi> and this explication of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> is ſo forced, and remote from the natural ſenſe of <hi>Raban</hi> his words, that there are few reaſonable perſons to whom 'twill not appear a pitiful evaſion.</p>
                        <p>YET does Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> earneſtly urge not only that 'twas the ſenſe of <hi>Raban</hi> to attack this Propoſition, but likewiſe that of <hi>Bertram,</hi> in his Book <hi>De Corpore &amp; Sanguine Domini.</hi> And altho the anonymous Author, who according to all probability lived about the 9th. Century, expreſly ſays, that <hi>Raban</hi> and <hi>Bertram</hi> refuted <hi>Paſchaſus.</hi> Yet does Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> affirm the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:41961:324"/> contrary, and ſays that he demonſtratively proves it. He ſays for this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <hi>That there were people in that time who groſly ſaid that the Body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt was ſuch as the Sacrament appeared to be, which is to ſay, that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt has really the form of Bread. That this opinion was a neceſſary conſequence of that of</hi> Amalarius, <hi>that 'tis from thence he concluded that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt iſſued thro the pores, and applied unto it theſe words, Omne quod in os intrat, in ventrem vadit, &amp; in ſeceſſum emittitur. That it is apparent from the accuſation which</hi> Florus <hi>forms againſt him of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving corrupted</hi> France <hi>by theſe fantaſtical opinions, that</hi> Amalarius <hi>had his Diſciples. Here then,</hi> adds he, <hi>we have people, who ſaid in the time of</hi> Charles the Bald, <hi>and who muſt ſay according to their Principles, That the Body of Jeſus Chriſt has all the external accidents which appear to our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and that there was no difference between the Body of Jeſus Chriſt born of the Virgin, and the Sacrament. So that here are perſons againſt whom may be maintain'd in an Orthodox ſenſe, that the Sacrament of the Euchariſt is not the Body of Jeſus Chriſt born of the Virgin.</hi> He afterwards endeavours to ſhew that <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Book directly attacks only theſe perſons.</p>
                        <p>TO ſolve this difficulty, it muſt firſt be ſuppoſed as a thing already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that thoſe who have been ſince called (by way of reproach) Stercora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, cannot be thoſe of whom Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> here ſpeaks; who according to him believing the Real Preſence, yet affirm'd that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt had all the ſenſible accidents which appear in the Euchariſt, and that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> could ſay nothing leſs to the purpoſe than what he has offered, <hi>That this opinion was a neceſſary conſequence of that of</hi> Amalarius, <hi>that 'tis from thence he concluded the Body of Jeſus Chriſt iſſued out thro the pores, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to it theſe words, Omne quod in os intrat, in ventrem vadit &amp; inſeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum emittitur.</hi> We have already ſeen from the teſtimony of <hi>Tho. Waldenſis,</hi> that theſe Stercoraniſts were <hi>Panites,</hi> which is to ſay, that they conſerved the ſubſtance of Bread in the Sacrament, and ſaid <hi>all of 'em</hi> that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was <hi>natural Bread.</hi> We have already ſeen that in effect the belief of the Real Preſence is abſolutely inconſiſtent with this opinion, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament paſſes into our nouriſhment, that it is digeſted, that one part of it is changed into our fleſh, and another part into Excrements.</p>
                        <p>SECONDLY, we muſt obſerve that ſuppoſing 'twere true the Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coraniſts believ'd, as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would have it, that the ſenſible accidents really affect the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in the Euchariſt, there could be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more abſurd than to imagin they were thoſe whom <hi>Raban</hi> and <hi>Bertram</hi> oppoſed. For as to <hi>Raban</hi> it appears as well from the teſtimony of the anonymous Author, as by that of <hi>Waldenſis,</hi> that he was himſelf a Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coraniſt. The ſame thing appears from the proper paſſages of <hi>Raban,</hi> which I have already related. Whereunto I ſhall add another, taken out of his <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential, Touching what you have demanded of me, whether the Euchariſt</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Cap. 33.</note> 
                           <hi>when it has been conſum'd, and paſs'd into Excrements like other meats, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns again to its firſt nature which it had before 'twas Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the Altar. (This opinion is contrary to that of Pope</hi> Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">This Period which I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in this Parentheſis has no coherence with the diſcourſe of <hi>Raban,</hi> and my conjecture is, that it is a remark which ſome body put in the Margin, and which has been afterwards for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out of the Margin into the Text.</note> 
                           <hi>and ſeveral other Holy Fathers, who ſay, that the Body of our Lord does not go into the draught with other meats.) Such a queſtion is ſuperfluous, ſeeing our Saviour ſays himſelf in the Goſpel, Whatſoever enters into the mouth deſcends into the ſtomach and is caſt into the draught. The Sacrament of the Body and Blood is made of viſible and corporeal things, but ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:41961:325"/> inviſibly our ſanctification and ſalvation of both Body and Soul. What rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is there to ſay that what is digeſted in the ſtomach, and paſſes into Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, returns again to its firſt ſtate, ſeeing no body ever maintain'd that this happens.</hi> I think we have clearly here the opinion of <hi>Raban</hi> on this ſubject, and that now it cannot be any longer queſtion'd whether he was a Stercoraniſt. As to <hi>Bertram,</hi> the paſſages which I related out of his Book do clearly ſhew that he was of the ſame ſentiment. What can be more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable and worſe contriv'd than this thought of Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> that <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> and <hi>Bertram</hi> have combated the opinion of the Stercoraniſts, which is to ſay, that they have fought againſt themſelves, and wrote Books againſt perſons without knowing they were themſelves of their party. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> could not ſay any thing more unlikely, and therefore we ſee that great Wits who believe 'emſelves able to overthrow every thing, do oft-times over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw themſelves, and fall into labyrinths whence they cannot get out.</p>
                        <p>IN the third place, how little ſoever we conſider this opinion, mention'd by Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> and the manner in which he conceives it, we ſhall find 'tis impoſſible it ſhould ever come into any bodies mind unleſs he were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively extravagant. Not to mention how difficult it is to ſtate how the natural accidents of Bread do unlooſe themſelves from their proper and natural ſubſtance to faſten on that of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, nor how the ſame numerical ſubſtance can be above in Heaven indued with its own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per accidents, and here below indued really with the accidents of Bread and Wine. I ſhall only ſay, that unleſs a man doats extremely, he cannot imagin that the ſame numerical Body which is above, exiſts on Earth in a corporeal and material manner, as a ſubject ought to exiſt that has accidents really inherent; and yet is there in the natural manner of a real ſubſtance of Bread. For every ſubſtance that receives and really ſuſtains the accidents of Bread, muſt receive and ſuſtain them in the manner of a true ſubſtance of Bread to accommodate it ſelf to the nature of theſe accidents. A ſubſtance which receives really the accidents of Bread, muſt have all its parts <hi>in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine ad ſe,</hi> as the Schools ſpeak, made as the parts of real Bread, to the end there may be ſome proportion between them and the accidents which it receives. And is it not an extravagancy to ſay that the parts of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man body of Jeſus Chriſt, to wit, his head, his arms, and other members do exiſt inwardly <hi>in ordine ad ſe</hi> in the manner of the parts of Bread, as little crums. Who ever ſaw any thing more hollow than this Philoſophy, a human Body really diviſible, really palpable, really ſenſible of a diviſibility, a palpability, and a ſenſibility, which is proper to it, and yet is not natural to it, but borrowed of another ſubject? This diviſibility and this palpability of the Bread which reſide really in the ſame ſubſtance of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, made it capable of all the changes which the Bread ſuffers, it was digeſted by the natural heat in the ſtomachs of the Communicants, and one part was reduced into their proper ſubſtance animated with their ſoul, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with their life, and united to them perſonally. What did they then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, did they imagin that this ſame Body of Jeſus Chriſt, was at the ſame time animated with two ſouls, and living with two lives, or to ſpeak better with an hundred thouſand ſouls, and an hundred thouſand lives, to wit, that of Jeſus Chriſt, and of thoſe of all the Communicants of the world, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally united to the Son of God, and perſonally to an hundred millions of men at a time; or do they imagin that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is looſed from his proper and natural Soul, and diſ-united hypoſtatically from the Word? Believe me, a man muſt be fallen into a dreadful diſorder of mind
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:41961:325"/> to be guilty of theſe kind of fooleries. But if theſe perſons of the 9th. Century againſt whom <hi>Raban</hi> and <hi>Bertram</hi> wrote, believed in effect all theſe matters, how happens it, there's no ſuch thing to be found in Authors of thoſe Ages, nor the following ones; and that to eſtabliſh this fact, to wit, that there were perſons who believ'd that the proper Body of Jeſus Chriſt, the ſame numerical ſubſtance which is in Heaven, is here below really endued with the accidents of Bread, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> could offer nothing but ſome few conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures impertinently drawn from a Principle of <hi>Amalarius?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT you will ſay, how happens it that the paſſages which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> alledges out of <hi>Bertram</hi> ſeem not directly to oppoſe the Doctrin of <hi>Paſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and that ſometimes they both meet in their expreſſions? <hi>Bertram</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares his deſign was againſt people who maintain that the myſtery of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt which is celebrated in the Church is not made under any figure, nor under any vail, but that the truth appears therein naked and manifeſt. <hi>He makes to himſelf the queſtions, Whether the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, which is received in the Church by the mouth of the Faithful, be made as a myſtery, or as a truth, which is to ſay, Whether it contains any thing conceal'd which is only perceiv'd by the eyes of Faith, or whether without the vail of any myſtery the ſight of the body ſees outwardly that which the ſight of the mind ſees inwardly; ſo that whatſoever is done in this myſtery is diſcovered to the view of ſenſe.</hi> And in the ſecond place, <hi>Whether it be the ſame Body which was born of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>that ſuffered and died. Paſchaſus</hi> on the other hand declares, <hi>That it ought not to be denied that this Sacrament is a figure.</hi> He diſtinguiſhes <hi>that which is felt outwardly from that which is hid inwardly;</hi> and teaches that one is the figure of the other, <hi>Eſt autem figura vel character hoc quod exterius ſentitur ſed totum veritas, &amp; nulla adumbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio quod interius percipitur.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>ALL the force of this objection conſiſts in an equivocation. <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> takes the term of <hi>figure</hi> in one ſenſe, <hi>Bertram</hi> takes it in another. <hi>Bertram</hi> affirms that the Euchariſt is a figure in a ſenſe which <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> denies. So that their Doctrins in the main cannot be more oppoſite than they are. And of this the readers needed not to have been ignorant, had Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> been pleaſed to relate in what manner <hi>Bertram</hi> explains himſelf. For having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed two queſtions in the terms which we have ſeen, he adds, <hi>Let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min the firſt of theſe queſtions, and to clear it from all ambiguity define what we mean by a figure, and what by truth; to the end, that having ſomething that is certain before our eyes, we may better find the reaſonable way which we ought to follow. The figure is a kind of ſhadow, which by means of ſome vails, ſhews us what it propoſes to ſhew us. As for example, when we would ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Word we call it Bread, as in the Lords Prayer, where we ask our daily bread, or as our Saviour ſays in the Goſpel, I am the living Bread that came down from Heaven. Thus does he call himſelf a Vine, and his Diſciples the Branches. I am, ſays he, the true Vine, and you are the Branches. In all which there is one thing ſaid, and another ſignified. The truth on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is a manifeſt demonſtration of the thing without uſing either ſhadow, image, or vail, it being diſcovered by ſimple and natural expreſſions, there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be underſtood but what is contained in the terms. 'Tis not the ſame in theſe other examples, for our Saviour Chriſt is not ſubſtantially either Bread, or Vine, nor the Apoſtles Branches, Here then we have a figure, but in the laſt examples, the truth is uttered in plain and open terms. Now to apply this to the things in queſtion, to wit, the Body and Blood of Chriſt. Were this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:41961:326"/> celebrated without a figure it could not be call'd a myſtery: for one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not call that a myſtery, wherein there is nothing ſecret, nothing remote from the corporal ſenſes, nor hid under any vail. Yet this Bread which is made the Body of Chriſt by the miniſtry of the Prieſt, ſhews another thing outwardly to the ſenſes, and offers another thing to the intelligence of the Faithful. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly one diſcovers the form of Bread, its colour and ſavour, ſuch as it was before. But there is another thing far more precious and excellent which is taught inwardly, a divine and heavenly thing, to wit, the Body of Jeſus Chriſt which is therein repreſented, and 'tis not by the corporal ſenſes, but by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual intelligence of the Faithful that this thing is conſidered, taken and eaten.</hi> He ſays the ſame of the Vine, and concludes, <hi>ſeeing no body can deny but this is ſo, 'tis manifeſt that this Bread and this Wine are the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt figuratively.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A man muſt ſhut his eyes if he cannot ſee he means that the Bread and Wine of the Euchariſt are a myſtery which repreſent to us the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; and that when they be called the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt 'tis a figurative locution, like in ſome ſort to theſe others in the Goſpel, where our Lord is called Bread, a Vine, and his Apoſtles Branches. Now 'tis preciſely in this ſenſe that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> denied the Euchariſt was a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. <hi>When our Saviour,</hi> ſays he, <hi>brake and gave the Bread to his Diſciples,</hi>

                           <hi>he does not ſay that this, or there is in this myſtery a certain virtue, or a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of my Body, but he ſays plainly, This is my Body.</hi> And a little lower, <hi>I marvail at ſome peoples ſaying 'tis a figure, and not the truth, a ſhadow and not the Body.</hi> And in his Letter to <hi>Frudegard, Sacramentum Corporis Chriſti &amp; Sanguinis quamvis Sacramentum dicatur non eſt aliud quam veritas &amp; quod ipſa veritas repromiſit,</hi> which he proves by the ſame examples which <hi>Bertram</hi> alledges of ſimple locutions, to wit, of the Birth, Incarnation and Paſſion of our Saviour. <hi>Theſe things,</hi> ſays he, <hi>which our Saviour did as God and Man, be Sacraments of his Grace and a myſtery of Faith, and yet are they nothing but the truth, altho they be called Sacraments.</hi> And he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards makes this objection. <hi>Theſe things being myſteries cannot</hi> (to wit in this quality) <hi>be either ſeen, or toucht, and conſequently this is not a Body, and if it be not a Body, they are a figure of the Fleſh and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and not this Fleſh and this Blood in propriety of nature.</hi> Then anſwering this objection, <hi>Totum,</hi> ſays he, <hi>quod eſt Chriſtus proedicatur, non in figura, ſed in re, &amp; in proprietate, atque in natura.</hi> 'Tis then plain that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> and <hi>Bertram</hi> are directly oppoſite not only as to ſence but terms. So that when <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> acknowledges there is a figure in the Euchariſt, meaning by this figure, either the accidents of Bread and Wine which cover the ſubſtance of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, or the repreſentation of the Paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, this expreſſion in this ſenſe does not hinder, but <hi>Bertram</hi> formally contradicted it, and that the teſtimony of the anonymous is true. For <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſus</hi> expreſly denies the Euchariſt to be the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in figure, and <hi>Bertram</hi> expreſly affirms it.</p>
                        <p>AS to wherein both of 'em ſeem to agree in ſaying that our ſenſes ſhew it to be Bread, but that inwardly our Faith diſcovers therein the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, this is but an equivocation. <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> means we muſt not refer our ſelves to the teſtimony of our ſenſes in reſpect of the ſubſtance hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under the accidents, and by the term of <hi>inwardly</hi> he means this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance covered with accidents which he would have us believe to be the ſubſtance of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Bertram</hi> on the contrary argues
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:41961:326"/> from the teſtimony of our ſenſes, and concludes that 'tis real Bread and real Wine in ſubſtance. For he maintains from the evidence of ſenſe that there happens no real change. <hi>According to the ſpecies of the creature;</hi> ſays he, <hi>and the form of viſible things, the Bread and Wine do not ſuffer any change. And if they do not ſuffer any change, they are not any thing elſe but what they were before.</hi> And in another place, <hi>We ſee not any thing that is changed in theſe things corporally. We muſt then confeſs, either that they be changed in another reſpect than that of the Body, and conſequently that they are not what appears in truth</hi> (which is to ſay, they are not the ſubſtance of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in truth, becauſe 'twould be then inviſible were it there) <hi>but that they are another thing which yet we plainly ſee they are not by their proper exiſtence. Or if this will not be acknowledg'd, it muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſity be denied that they are the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt which will be impious to ſay or think.</hi> And immediately after he concludes that the change which happens to the Bread and Wine is a change of figure; <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t jam,</hi> ſays he, <hi>commutatio figurate facta eſſe dicatur.</hi> He alſo proves there that the change which happens to the Euchariſt does not make the Bread and Wine ceaſe to be in truth what they were before. <hi>We do not find,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that ſuch a change happens here, but we find on the contrary that the ſame ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the creature which was before remains ſtill.</hi> And a little lower, <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the ſubſtance of creatures they are after the Conſecration what they were before; they were before Bread and Wine, and we ſee they remain in the ſame kind, altho they be conſecrated.</hi> And again he concludes that 'tis not the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> but in <hi>virtute,</hi> becauſe our eyes do not ſee it, <hi>'Tis Faith,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that ſees whatſoever this is, the eye of the fleſh diſcovers nothing therein, theſe viſible things then are not the Body of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in ſpecie, <hi>but in virtue.</hi> He underſtands then that the teſtimony of our ſenſes which ſhew us that they are ſtill Bread and Wine in ſubſtance, are true, and that were the ſubſtance of the Body therein, our ſenſes would diſcover it. Now this wholly contradicts the ſenſe of <hi>Paſchaſus.</hi>

                        <p>THIS contrariety of ſentiment appears ſtill more in the ſecond queſtion which <hi>Bertram</hi> diſcuſſes, which is, <hi>Whether what the Faithful receive with the mouths of their bodies in the Communion, is this ſame Body which was born of the Virgin, that has ſuffered for us, died and roſe again, and is now at the right hand of the Father. Paſchaſus</hi> affirms it, and endeavours to eſtabliſh it by his Book. <hi>Bertram</hi> denies it and proves moſt ſtrongly his negative. The one ſays <hi>that theſe things nouriſh in us that which is born of God, and not</hi>
                           <pb n="258" facs="tcp:41961:327"/> 
                           <hi>that which is born of Fleſh and Blood.</hi> The other anſwers us, <hi>that in reſpect of what we ſee, and receive corporally, which is bit with the teeth, ſwallowed and received into the ſtomach, they do not communicate eternal life; for in this reſpect they nouriſh our mortal fleſh, and do not communicate any corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</hi> The one ſays, <hi>That we muſt not ſtop at the ſavour, nor colour of Bread; for were it changed into fleſh</hi> (to wit, viſibly and ſenſibly, as he explains himſelf in the ſame place) <hi>'twould be no longer the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The other teaches, <hi>That ſeeing 'tis Faith, and not the eye of the Body which diſcovers the Bread to be the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, we muſt hence conclude that 'tis not ſo in</hi> ſpecie, <hi>but in</hi> virtute. The one ever ſays, that what we <hi>receive from the Altar is this ſame Fleſh which is born of the Virgin.</hi> The other ſays, <hi>that this Fleſh which was Crucified, and born of the Virgin conſiſts of bones and ſinews, diſtinguiſh'd into ſeveral members, and enliven'd by the ſpirit of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſoul, having his proper life and motions. Whereas this ſpiritual Fleſh which nouriſhes ſpiritually the Faithful in reſpect of its outward ſpecies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of grains of Wheat and is made by the hands of man, that it has neither nerves, nor ſinews, nor bones, nor different members, that 'tis animated with no rational ſoul, nor can exerciſe any vital functions.</hi> Whence he concludes that 'tis not then this Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt which was born of the Virgin. In a word, the oppoſition therein is ſo formal, and ſo evident, that it cannot be more plain.</p>
                        <p>WHAT we have hitherto ſeen touching Authors Contemporary with <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> yields us a demonſtrative proof that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> was an Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; for the reſt do not ſpeak like him, there are two of the famouſeſt of 'em, <hi>viz. Raban</hi> and <hi>Bertram,</hi> who have expreſly applied themſelves to the refuting of his Doctrin.</p>
                        <p>TO theſe two we may add a third, which is <hi>John Scot,</hi> who wrote alſo by the command of <hi>Charles the Bald</hi> againſt the novelties of <hi>Paſchaſus.</hi> His Book was burnt in the Council of <hi>Verſeil,</hi> and we underſtand from the teſtimony of <hi>Aſcelinus</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Berenger,</hi> that the end which he propoſed was to ſhew in this Book that what is Conſecrated on the Altar is neither the true Body, nor the true Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Toto niſu totaque intentione ad hoc ſolum tendere video, ut mihi perſuadeat hoc videlicet quod in Altari Conſecratur neque vere Corpus, neque vere Chriſti Sanguinem eſſe, hoc autem aſtruere nititur ex Sanctorum Patrum opuſculis quae prave exponit.</hi> The Author of the Diſſertation which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has inſerted in his 12th. Book, pretends that the Book which we have under the name of <hi>Bertram,</hi> and that of <hi>John Scot</hi> are the ſame. He endeavours likewiſe to leſſen as much as in him lies the authority of this Adverſary to <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> and I had not finiſh'd this Work without examining his Conjectures, had not one of my Friends inform'd me that he had eas'd me of this pains, as well as this Author has help'd Mr. <hi>Arnaud.</hi> I hope this friend of mine will ſoon publiſh his Piece, which will (or I am greatly deceived) fully ſatisfie every unprejudic'd man that ſeeks the truth.</p>

                              <hi>Of Perſonal Differences which Mr.</hi> Arnaud <hi>has treated of in his Eleventh Book.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>HAving ſatisfied whatſoever reſpects the matter of this Diſpute, my deſign wherein I am engaged of returning an exact anſwer to Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s volume ſeems to require, I ſhould now paſs to the diſcuſſion of his eleventh Book which he has entituled <hi>perſonal differences between the Author of the</hi> Perpetuity <hi>and me.</hi> The intereſt alſo of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s injuſtices obliges me to this. Yet can I not wholly keep within this Province, for there are ſeveral reaſons hindering me, which I hope judicious perſons will not diſallow.</p>
                        <p>FIRST, theſe perſonal differences are handled in ſo ſharp and hot a manner, ſo full of animoſities that 'twere better a thouſand times to paſs 'em over in ſilence, and offer 'em as a Sacrifice to Piety, Patience, and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Charity, than to endeavour to treat of 'em exactly, and repel Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi>'s outrages, which cannot be well done without ſometimes exceeding the bounds of Chriſtian moderation.</p>
                        <p>MOREOVER, altho I do not doubt but Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> and the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> have reaſon to believe that the publick will take part with what reſpects their perſons, yet I cannot pretend 'tis the ſame with me. Theſe Gentlemen have made a noiſe in the world, they have drawn upon 'em the expectations of all <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> Whereas I am perſon obſcure enough, and whoſe name is only known by my intereſt in this Diſpute; ſo that 'twill be a preſumption in me to believe the publick will concern it ſelf in my reſpect. Should I then here begin with a long diſcuſſion of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and reciprocal defences, the readers might well ſay to one another that they have nothing to do with this, and that 'tis an abuſe of their patience after a long diſcourſe of things which relate to the cauſe, to engage them further in a tireſom diſcourſe of Perſonal Differences.</p>
                        <p>IN the third place Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has introduced amongſt his Perſonal Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences ſeveral things to which 'tis impoſſible to anſwer without engaging in tedious prolixities in matters which of 'emſelves have no coherence with that of the Euchariſt. I place in this rank the defence which he makes of a cruel invective of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> againſt the firſt Reformers, which yet Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> maintains in a more fierce manner, grounding it on Facts, and Principles, ſome of which are falſe, others taken in a wrong ſenſe, and others invidiouſly perverted. How can we handle in a few words ſo important a ſubject when the queſtion concerns the juſtifying the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of ſeveral great men, and to ſhew at the ſame time the juſtice and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of our ſeparation from the Roman Church? 'Tis plain this cannot be done in one or two Chapters, and that this is matter for a great Volume. I reduce under this head theſe paſſionate expreſſions which begin the 9th. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter of this 11th Book, and which I deſign to relate here, that the world may judg of 'em. <hi>We demand juſtice,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> ſpeaking of me, <hi>for the exceſſes of which he has been guilty contrary to all rules of honeſty and</hi>
                           <pb n="260" facs="tcp:41961:328"/> 
                           <hi>truth, which even Pagans would bluſh to violate. We would gladly know of him whether his morals will give him this licenſe. We are already ſatisfied that the Maxims of their new Divinity promiſe impunity to all manner of crimes, provided they be of the faithful Calviniſts who commit them; and we do not queſtion him whether he fears to be damn'd by calumniating his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. We know the ſolutions of his Doctors deliver him from this fear, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what S.</hi> Paul <hi>ſays, who tells us, that ſlanderers ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of God. But that which we deſire to know is, whether they have of late taken away from Crimes, the name of Crimes, and ſtript them of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral infamy which accompanies 'em, whether the name of a Slanderer be no longer odious amongſt Calviniſts, and whether they have ſanctified this name, which is ſo horrible amongſt men that they could not find a blacker, to ſhew their deteſtation of it, than to call ſuch Devils.</hi> I deſign not to repel theſe diſcourſes to be met with ſcattered throughout his whole Book, any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than by reciting 'em, or at moſt by cenſuring 'em as exceſſes, which do not at all become a perſon, who pretends to correct our morals, and teach us virtue and moderation. I ſhall not retort upon him ſeveral things in my turn, which a juſt and natural defence ſeems to permit, and enjoyn me to tell him. But I pretend to juſtifie ſo well our Morals as will make Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> bluſh for ſhame that he has attackt them with ſuch an outragious and malicious air. And this we cannot do here tranſiently, nor by way of anſwer to ten or twelve hot periods, which like lightning have more fire than matter. 'Tis neceſſary for this purpoſe to be diſengaged from all other ſubjects; for there needs more time to remedy an evil than to do it, to cure a wound than to make it.</p>
                        <p>AND theſe are the reaſons which withhold me from entring into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act diſcuſſion of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s eleventh Book. But becauſe there are in theſe Perſonal Differences ſome Articles which I cannot wholly paſs over in ſilence, having too near a relation to the things which we treat of, the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers I hope will not take it ill, if I deſign this whole Chapter to anſwer them. This Book conſiſts either of paſſionate invectives againſt me, or defences againſt ſome of my Complaints, or accuſations againſt me. As to the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate expreſſions I concern not my ſelf with 'em, I leave 'em to the publick judgment, and Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s private conſcience. It belongs to him to look whether he has form'd his ſtile according to the lovely idea which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has given us of the true Eloquence, <hi>which is,</hi> ſays he, <hi>diſcreet, modeſt,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 11. ch. 8. page 1128.</note> 
                           <hi>judicious, ſincere, true, which ſerves to diſentangle things, and not to confound 'em, which clears truth, and offers it in ſuch a manner as is proper to introduce it into the mind and heart, which inſpires motions that are juſt, reaſonable, proportionable to the things which we handle, which has no other luſtre but what ſerves to diſcover truth, no ſtrength but what is borrowed from her.</hi> He will examin, I hope, at his leiſure, whether he has obſerved all theſe grave characters, and whether his eagerneſs to overcome has not tranſported him ſometimes into ſuch ſtrange convulſions as are wholly contrary to all mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and decency.</p>
                        <p>AS to his defences, I can with confidence affirm there are none of 'em which be juſt and warrantable; but to the end it may not be ſaid I deſire to be believed on my own bare word, let a man judg of 'em by theſe examples. The Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> to prove that <hi>Bertram</hi> was not clearly of our opinion, alledged this reaſon, that <hi>Trithemus</hi> praiſed this Author. To this I anſwered, that he praiſed him <hi>becauſe in effect he deſerved it, and that</hi>
                           <pb n="261" facs="tcp:41961:328"/> 
                           <hi>this only increaſed his authority.</hi> My ſenſe is plainly that he prais'd him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew his reputation was great in the 9th. Century, that his Book was therein well entertain'd, and his memory honored in the following Ages. For this is what muſt be underſtood <hi>by being in effect praiſe-worthy,</hi> and this is likewiſe what the terms of my anſwer inſinuate, having added that <hi>this only increaſed his authority,</hi> which is to ſay, that this teſtimony of <hi>Trithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> ſhewed that <hi>Bertram</hi> was authoris'd in the Church of his time. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> concealing this true ſenſe of my words, imputes to me another, which is that I ſaid, <hi>Trithemus, who believed the Real Preſence, praiſed</hi> Bertram <hi>for oppoſing it,</hi> which is a ridiculous ſenſe, and infinitely diſtant from mine. This is the ſubject of my complaint, and here is the defence of Mr. <hi>Arnaud, What is,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the ſenſe of theſe words,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 11. ch. 3. p. 1105, 1106.</note> Trithemus <hi>praiſed</hi> Bertram, <hi>becauſe he was indeed praiſe-worthy? Do they ſignifie that he praiſed him from his own knowledg, or from the opinion of others? It is clear they have only the firſt ſenſe, and not the ſecond.</hi> All is clear which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ſpeaks, but let us ſee how he proves it. <hi>To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend any one from the teſtimony of another, is not to commend him becauſe he is in effect praiſe-worthy, ſeeing there are ſeveral people which we do not in effect judg to be praiſe-worthy, altho thought worthy of praiſe by others. To commend a man becauſe he is in effect worthy of commendations, is proceeding on a juſt and true ground, and on the reality of things, and not on reports, and popular opinions.</hi> This is a pitiful defence, for 'tis certain there are people who are not judged to be praiſe-worthy altho they be praiſed by others: but I ſay that there are others which are deemed praiſe-worthy in effect, only becauſe we find 'em generally commended in the Age wherein they lived, and in the following ones, without being blamed by any body. Do not moſt people thus believe S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> and S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> praiſe-worthy, not for having read their Books, nor examin'd their Doctrins, but as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were eſteem'd by their own and following Ages, and that their memory was never withered in the Church? Now this is what I ſay, that <hi>Trithemus</hi> might know of <hi>Bertram</hi> without examining his Book, to wit, that he had the eſteem of his Age, and that his memory was reſpected in the following ones.</p>
                        <p>IT ſignifies nothing for Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to ſay, that I ought not to ſuppoſe without proving it that ſuch an Author as <hi>Trithemus, who writes a Catalogue of Eccleſiaſtical Writers, and gives particular praiſes to an Author, does it barely from the relation of others, and that the preſumption is on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that he has read his Book and ſpeaks of it from his own proper knowledg.</hi> This I ſay is to no purpoſe, for it belongs to the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> that argues, and would draw a concluſion from the praiſes of <hi>Trithemus,</hi> to eſtabliſh well his Principle, to prove that <hi>Trithemus</hi> has praiſed <hi>Bertram</hi> after he had read and examin'd his Book, <hi>De Corpore &amp; Sanguine Domini,</hi> and not to me who anſwer, to prove that he has praiſed him, becauſe he acknowledges his Fame was great in the 9th. Century. Were a man to judg hereof by preſumptions, they would be rather for my ſuppoſition than for that of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity;</hi> for we know very well that thoſe who make Catalogues of Eccleſiaſtical Authors do not always take the pains to read exactly all the Books they mention. The Commendations of <hi>Ratram,</hi> whom we affirm to be <hi>Bertram,</hi> could not be unknown to <hi>Trithemus,</hi> and we have right to ſuppoſe that <hi>Trithemus</hi> has not diſtinguiſh'd <hi>Bertram</hi> and <hi>Ratram</hi> as two different perſons, till the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> has ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us the contrary.</p>

                        <p>THE ſecond complaint whereon Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> endeavours to defend the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> reſpects Mr. <hi>Blondel,</hi> whom this Author imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently accuſes to have fallen into contradiction <hi>in that he ſuppoſes on one hand that</hi> Amalarius <hi>was a Calviniſt, and on the other that the Synod of</hi> Creſſy, <hi>which condemned</hi> Amalarius <hi>was of the ſame mind;</hi> which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> is a manifeſt contradiction. Obſerve here his words. Uſher <hi>an Engliſh Proteſtant, ſuppoſes that</hi> Amalarius <hi>held</hi>

                           <hi>opinion, who makes the whole Synod of</hi> Creſſy <hi>who condemned</hi> Amalarius <hi>to conſiſt of Calviniſts, he takes this part, and ſuppoſes with him that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of</hi> Creſſy <hi>held the Calviniſts Doctrin, and were contrary to</hi> Paſchaſus. <hi>But finding elſewhere in the epitomiz'd Manuſcript of the Book of Divine Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of</hi> William <hi>of</hi> Malmsbury, <hi>that</hi> Amalarius, Raban, <hi>and</hi> Heribald <hi>wrote againſt</hi> Paſchaſus, <hi>not conſidering that this ſuppoſition was contrary to that of</hi> Vſher, <hi>he makes</hi> Amalarius <hi>again an adverſary to</hi> Paſchaſus; <hi>ſo that by a manifeſt contradiction, he pretends that the Council which condemned</hi> Amala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, <hi>and</hi> Amalarius <hi>who was condemned by the Council, were of one mind, and equally contrary to the Doctrin of</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>on the ſubject of the Euchariſt.</hi> So far is what the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> ſays.</p>
                        <p>TO anſwer this accuſation, <hi>I ſaid that this pretended contradiction was</hi>

                           <hi>a fable, That Mr.</hi> Blondel <hi>did not ſo much as think of Biſhop</hi> Uſher, <hi>and that the part which the Author of the</hi> Perpetuity <hi>gives to this Biſhop in this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, was a mere Romantick whimſie. That in the main, there was no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in what Mr.</hi> Blondel <hi>ſaid; for aſſerting on one hand that</hi> Amalarius <hi>was cenſured by the Synod of</hi> Creſſy <hi>for writing that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt was triform and tripartite, and on the other that</hi> Amalarius <hi>had been one of thoſe that contradicted the novelties of</hi> Paſchaſus, <hi>and in fine that he does not ſeparate the Fathers of</hi> Creſſy <hi>from the number of theſe Opponents, theſe three things were very conſiſtent together, becauſe it did not follow from the Synod of</hi> Creſſy'<hi>s condemning the triform and tripartite Body that they adopted for this all</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>his Fancies touching the Real Preſence.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>LET us now ſee Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s defence. He aſſures us that what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <note place="margin">Book 11. ch. 4. p. 1108, 1109.</note> of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> has aſſerted touching Biſhop <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher is a very likely conjecture, that if it be a Romantick whimſie 'tis not an impoſſible one. For 'tis more than probable that</hi> Blondel, <hi>who was a man of great reading, writing on a matter, was not ignorant of the opinion of a perſon ſo much eſteemed by his own Party, as Biſhop</hi> Uſher <hi>deſervedly was:</hi> that moreover 'tis a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance that tends only to excuſe <hi>Blondel,</hi> and not to criminate him; for it being certain that he has contradicted himſelf, 'tis always better that this has been done with ſome appearance of reaſon, as is that of following the opinion of a famous Author, than without any probability.</p>
                        <p>IS not this a mere mockery of us, or of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> to defend him after this rate? This Author relates to us as a matter of fact, that <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> believ'd ſuch and ſuch a thing, that <hi>Blondel</hi> finding advantage in

                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> has taken part of it, that he has joyn'd this part with what he likewiſe found in the Epitomy of <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the one was contrary to the other. Now we demand of him where he found this fine Hiſtory, ſeeing there appears nothing of it in <hi>Blon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi>'s Book. And Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> anſwers that 'tis a conjecture very likely, that if it be a Romance, <hi>'tis a Romance that is poſſible to be true, and one which tends to excuſe</hi> Blondel, becauſe 'tis better he be deceived with ſome pretext than without any.</p>
                        <p>LET Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> tell us, if he pleaſes, in what Morals he has found 'twas permitted the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> to pay us with his conjectures, and his poſſible Romances, inſtead of true Hiſtories, and to tell ſtories at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to render Mr. <hi>Blondel</hi> ridiculous, becauſe 'tis better he ſhould be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous for ſome reaſon than for none. We thank him for his Charity, but 'tis exceſſive, and unneceſſary; for what need was there he ſhould charge his Conſcience with this pious fraud to extenuate a chimerical diſhonor, ſeeing the pretended contradiction of Mr. <hi>Blondel</hi> is but a mere imagination.</p>

                           <hi>that the Council of</hi> Creſſy <hi>were Calviniſts, but their condemning of</hi> Amalarius, <hi>to ſuppoſe hereupon</hi> Amalarius <hi>was a Calviniſt, this is a contradicting of a man's ſelf, and this is what</hi> Blondel <hi>does.</hi> How ill does Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> defend his Friend. 'Tis not true that <hi>Blondel</hi> grounded himſelf on what he ſays of the Synod of <hi>Creſſy,</hi> in that this Synod has condemned <hi>Amalarius.</hi> We ſhall find nothing of this in his Book. And ſuppoſing he did ground him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on it, he might do it without falling into contradiction, and without giving occaſion to the accuſation of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity;</hi> for he might draw a negative argument thence in this ſenſe. That this Synod which could not be ignorant what was the Doctrin of <hi>Amalarius</hi> touching the Real Preſence contented themſelves with cenſuring in him ſome expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as that of <hi>Corpus triforme &amp; tripartitum,</hi> without handling his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin at bottom; which is a mark that in this reſpect they were agreed with him, and conſequently that they rejected the Real Preſence as well as <hi>Amalarius.</hi> Now in this caſe one might well diſpute the force of this proof, but there is no likelihood of making a contradiction of it. But in fine to decide clearly this queſtion, and to ſhew Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> how dangerous it is for a man to give himſelf over to too great deſires of finding fault, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry Authors, I need only ſay that when Mr. <hi>Blondel</hi> reckons the Synod of <hi>Creſſy</hi> amongſt the number of thoſe that have followed <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> he does not ſpeak of that Synod which condemned <hi>Amalarius,</hi> but of another that was held ten years after. In effect he formally diſtinguiſhes theſe two Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, ſaying of one, <hi>That this conception of</hi> Amalarius, <hi>that the Body of</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Illucidations on the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, ch. 18. p. 421, 422. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 427.</note> 
                           <hi>Jeſus Chriſt was triform and tripartite, was improved in the year 848. by the Council of</hi> Creſſy; <hi>and on the other, that ſeveral contradicted</hi> Paſchaſus, <hi>as</hi> Amalarius, Raban, Heribald, Bertram, <hi>or</hi> Ratram. John <hi>ſurnam'd</hi> Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genus, <hi>from whom,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I do not ſeparate</hi> Walafridus Strabo, <hi>Abbot of</hi> Richeneau, <hi>nor</hi> Florus <hi>a Divine of</hi> Lyons, <hi>nor the Body of the Biſhops aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in the year 858. at</hi> Creſſy. Theſe are then two different Synods, the one held in the year 848. and the other in the year 858. Of the one he ſays that it condemned the <hi>Corpus triforme &amp; tripartitum</hi> of <hi>Amalarius,</hi> of the other that he does not ſeparate them from thoſe who contradicted <hi>Paſchaſus:</hi> what contradiction is here? Had theſe Gentlemen, who have faln no leſs than three times on this affair of Mr. <hi>Blondel,</hi> taken the pains
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:41961:330"/> to read over the place of his Book here in queſtion, they would have found what I now tell 'em touching the diſtinction of theſe Synods, and deſiſted from maintaining their fabulous Hiſtory, and imaginary contradiction.</p>
                        <p>THESE two examples ſuffice to ſhew the weakneſs of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s defences. We muſt now come to his complaints and accuſations, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the injuſtice and unreaſonableneſs of 'em in few words, which will be no hard matter to do.</p>
                        <p>FIRST, he complains that I offered ſome leſſening expreſſions in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> on the ſubject of <hi>Bertram,</hi> or <hi>Ratram,</hi> that I oppoſed the praiſes which the Author of the <hi>Apology for the Holy Fathers</hi> gives this perſon, and thereupon remark'd that theſe Gentlemen praiſe or diſpraiſe people, raiſe or depreſs 'em, according as their intereſts and deſigns require, according as they oppoſe or favour their Opinions. Firſt, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> aſſures us that I falſified the words of the Author of the <note place="margin">Chap. 6.</note> 
                           <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> Secondly, He ſays I expounded his intentions according to my own fancy. Thirdly, He will not allow I had any reaſon to draw from his words compared with theſe of the <hi>Apology for the Holy Fathers,</hi> the concluſion which I drew thence. We muſt ſatisfie him in theſe three points.</p>
                        <p>AS to the pretended falſification, obſerve here in what manner I related in ſhort the diſcourſe of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity. He ſays that 'twas</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Anſwer to the ſecond Tome, part 3. ch. 1.</note> 
                           <hi>one call'd</hi> Ratram, <hi>or</hi> Bertram, <hi>an obſcure and intricate Divine, who adjoyn'd his reaſonings to the ordinary expreſſions of the Church, and expounded them according to his fancy, that as he was a Divine, he might argue as he pleaſed on this Faith, and that we can eaſily conceive a Divine may fall into frivolous reaſonings.</hi> There needs only the reading of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi>'s diſcourſe to acknowledg this to be a juſt abridgment of it. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does not gain-ſay it, but he ſays, I charge the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> with calling <hi>Bertram</hi> a <hi>frivolous and paſſionate Reaſoner,</hi> and for having <note place="margin">Book 11. ch. 6. p. 116.</note> ſaid abſolutely of him that one may well conceive that a Divine might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall upon frivolous reaſonings, whereas he ſaid this only conditionally, to wit, <hi>ſuppoſing 'twere granted he was effectually in an error:</hi> and this is what he calls a <hi>manifeſt falſity.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> complains impertinently: For I did not ſay that the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> has thus ſpoken of <hi>Bertram abſolutely,</hi> and this Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> acknowledges, to wit, that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing 'twere granted that <hi>Bertram had effectually erred, this would not at all hurt the Church, that 'tis no wonder that one man has erred, that a Divine ſhould fall into frivolous reaſonings.</hi> This I ſay is ſufficient for my deſign. For what ſignifies this but that in caſe <hi>Bertram</hi> cannot be brought over to them and made to ſpeak for the Real Preſence, he muſt then be a frivolous Divine, one who has faln into frivolous reaſonings. Now this is preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what I ſaid, that theſe Gentlemen praiſe, or diſpraiſe Authors according to their intereſts. If <hi>Bertram</hi> be for 'em all is well, they find no fault in him; but if it muſt be granted he is againſt 'em, then <hi>one may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that a Divine may fall into frivolous reaſonings.</hi> And thus Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi>'s illuſtration only confirms my remark. 'Tis the ſame in reſpect of what he adds that I charge the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> with calling <hi>Bertram</hi> an obſcure and intritate Divine, which <hi>is not thus ſet down in his Book, and that there is only that the greateſt advantage which the Calviniſts can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to touching this Author is, that he be ſet aſide as a perplext and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:41961:330"/> Author which can be profitable neither to one ſide nor the other.</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire no more; for this is almoſt in ſo many words to ſay, that if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have <hi>Bertram</hi> on their ſide, he muſt be put by as an obſcure and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Divine whom both Parties endeavour to explain in their favour, but who at bottom favours neither by reaſon of his perplexity: If he be for them all is well, if he be not he ſhall be laid aſide for a myſtical Divine. This falſification then which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> imputes to me is groundleſs, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he himſelf juſtifies me from it, and he confirms himſelf the truth of my reflection.</p>
                        <p>NEITHER has he more reaſon in what he ſays afterwards, <hi>that I</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Page 1117.</note> 
                           <hi>explain the intentions of others according to my own fancy, and raiſe up tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies to my ſelf on imaginary conjectures.</hi> Theſe are angry expreſſions, I pretend not to dive into the intentions of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> neither do I think of raiſing trophies to my ſelf at his coſt. My way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding is frank, natural, and ſimple, and if I commit faults, I can ſincerely proteſt 'tis againſt my will. I have ſaid nothing concerning the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> which I have not proved, not by making conjectures on his hidden thoughts, but arguing on his Writing, which is a kind of conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring very lawful in diſputes.</p>
                        <p>BUT in fine Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> will not allow I had reaſon in comparing the words of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> touching <hi>Bertram,</hi> which thoſe of the Author of the <hi>Apology for the Holy Fathers</hi> to draw thence the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion which I drew. He ſays <hi>my arguing ſuppoſes that theſe two Authors</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Page 1118.</note> 
                           <hi>are but one and the ſame perſon. For if they be two different Authors, what wonder can it be they have had different ſentiments on another Author.</hi> I anſwer, my reaſoning ſuppoſes only that the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> is one of the friends of the Author of the <hi>Apology,</hi> and that what's ſaid abroad in the world of theſe Gentlemen is true, that they publiſh nothing but what has been ſeen and approved of commonly amongſt 'em, which being ſo, I had right to draw my concluſion from the compariſon of the words of theſe two Authors, as nearly as if they were but one and the ſame perſon.</p>
                        <p>'TIS in vain for Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> to ſay <hi>that an Author may be praiſe-worthy in one piece, and blameable in another.</hi> I grant it, but I ſay that when one praiſes, or blames an Author, to raiſe up or depreſs any of his works, 'tis ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to ſay that one praiſes him, or blames him <hi>in this work.</hi> for we praiſe or blame abſolutely his perſon, to give hence afterwards more or leſs Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to the work in queſtion. When we depreſs or extol the perſon for the work ſake, then we praiſe or blame a man <hi>in his work:</hi> but when on the contrary we depreſs or extol the work by the perſon, then his praiſe or blame reſpects abſolutely the perſon, and then we draw this conſequence, that the work in queſtion is, or is not conſiderable. Now we are in this laſt circumſtance, the Author of the <hi>Apology</hi> commends <hi>Ratram</hi> to give the greater weight to his Books of Predeſtination, and the Author of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity</hi> depreſſes him to take away all authority from his Book <hi>De Corpore &amp; Sanguine Domini,</hi> ſo that their praiſe and diſpraiſe reſpect directly his perſon.</p>
                        <p>'TIS moreover in vain that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> remarks that the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity did not ſuppoſe the Book which goes under the name of</hi> Bertram <note place="margin">Page 1119.</note>
                           <pb n="266" facs="tcp:41961:331"/> 
                           <hi>was</hi> Ratram's <hi>a Religious of</hi> Corby <hi>Author of the Books of Predeſtination, and of the refutation of the errors of the Greeks. That ſeeing he teſtifies on the contrary to incline to the opinion of Mr.</hi> Marca, <hi>who will have this Book of</hi> Bertram <hi>and that of</hi> John Scot <hi>to be the ſame. That it appears at leaſt from his Book that he had no fixt ſentiment that</hi> Ratram <hi>was the Author of it.</hi> This is nothing but powder thrown into the Readers eyes; for ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing 'twere true that the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> were of the opinion of Mr. <hi>De Marca,</hi> which is, that this Book which bears the name of <hi>Bertram</hi> is <hi>John Scot</hi>'s, and not <hi>Ratram</hi>'s; yet 'tis certain what he ſays of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this <hi>Bertram,</hi> or <hi>Ratram</hi> (for he proves that theſe two names are but one and the ſame name) is on our ſuppoſition that 'twas the Religious of <hi>Corby.</hi> Whether he admits our ſuppoſition as believing it, in effect to be true, or whether he admits it merely thro condeſcention, 'tis needleſs to inquire: for ſuppoſing he admitted it only thro mere condeſcention, the leaſt his words could ſignifie will be that ſuppoſing he held our ſuppoſition to be true, which he does not, he will have theſe objections or reproaches to offer againſt the perſon of this Author, to wit, that he is a Divine who departs from the common belief of the Church by vain Speculations, a Divine who falls into frivolous reaſonings, which ſuffices to juſtifie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction between him and the Author of the <hi>Apology for the Holy Fathers.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D</hi>'s ſecond complaint is, that I ridicul'd the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> on the means he propoſed whereby <hi>to make Mr.</hi> Aubertin'<hi>s Book an excellent piece, which is to change the Objections of it into Proofs, and his Proofs into Objections.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> who has been toucht to the quick with it, thought he was oblig'd to defend himſelf by heaping up of words, intermixing ſeveral common places of raillery, alledging inſtances which have no relation to the point in queſtion, to diſtinguiſh and argue in mood and figure, and thereupon conclude with authority the ſentiment of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> is moſt juſt and reaſonable.</p>
                        <p>WERE it worth our while 'twould be eaſie to ſhew he deceives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in whatſoever he offers. But it being unjuſt to hold the Readers any longer on trifles, we ſhall only ſay, if either he, or the Author of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity</hi> have been offended at a very innocent raillery, it does not follow that others have been ſo too. We may tell him that his way of changing Proofs into Objections, and Objections into Proofs, is a conception ſo rare and well expreſs'd, that 'tis hard to hear it offered without finding in it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of laughter. Moreover, there's a great deal of difference between ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>that to diſcover the falſities of a Book, we need only to confront the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of it with the Originals,</hi> and to ſay <hi>that to make of Mr.</hi> Aubertin's <hi>Book an excellent piece in the ſenſe of the Catholicks, there need only be changed the Proofs into Objections and the Objections into Proofs.</hi> The confrontation of paſſages, is the juſter means, the moſt natural and moſt ordinary to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver falſities: but the change of Proofs into Objections, and Objections in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to proofs, is a kind of world turn'd upſide down. We may anſwer him that were his pretended method receiv'd, 'twould be applicable to all ſorts of Books of Controverſie on either ſide, there being few of them but what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of Proofs and Objections, and each Party pretending ſtill there is more light in his Proofs than in the Proofs of his Adverſary, which are called Objections. We may tell him in fine that Mr. <hi>Aubertin</hi>'s Book conſiſts not only of Proofs and Objections, but alſo of Inſtances or Replies againſt the ordinary Anſwers which are made to Proofs, and of Anſwers to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections;
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:41961:331"/> and this is what cannot be changed, ſo that when a man ſhould turn the Proofs into Objections and the Objections into Proofs, yet would he be perplexed by theſe inſtances, and anſwers, and conſequently muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg he has loſt his time and pains, and that the Author of the <hi>Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity</hi> has abuſed him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D</hi>'s third complaint is an accuſation couch'd under this title, <hi>A bitter Calumny againſt the Author of the Perpetuity.</hi> He propoſes it in his 9th. Chapter with an impetuoſity beyond example, and which ſhews he wrote it in the moſt cholerick temper imaginable. He aſcends his tribunal, and thence, pronounces this ſentence againſt me, that <hi>I am guilty</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ch. 9. p. 1130, 1131.</note> 
                           <hi>of an heinous crime, ſuch a one as obliges me both by the Laws of God and men to publick ſatisfaction. I is,</hi> ſays he again, <hi>a deteſtable calumny, an abomin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able crime, the moſt baſe and unjuſt proceeding a man can be capable of. Let not Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>marvel at theſe reproaches, this is no jeſting matter. He muſt not abuſe perſons of Honor for to fill up a ſentence. If he has expreſs'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thus thro incogitancy, I cannot but affirm him to be the moſt imprudent man in the world, and if he has done this with mature deliberation, I muſt declare him one of the boldeſt Calumniators as ever was, and am certain there's no honeſt man of his Communion but will grant what I ſay of him and condemn this his proceeding.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I proteſt before God with a ſincere heart, that I am in no wiſe concern'd at what Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> tells me. I have anſwer'd his Book, and am therewith content. But I am troubled he ſhould ſpoil this Diſpute, which the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick of either ſide might read perhaps with profit and pleaſure, and having diſcrediied it, I ſay, with paſſionate and violent expreſſions which cannot but diſguſt every man, he ſhould moreover finiſh it with raſh tranſports wholly unbeſeeming him. What reaſon has he for ſuch a paſſion? I wrote theſe words in my Book, <hi>God will one day ſhew, who they are that wrong his</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Anſwer to the ſecond Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, part 2. ch 3. at the end of the Chapter.</note> 
                           <hi>Church, the light of his judgment will diſcover all things, yea, and I hope before this comes to paſs men will break thro this ignorance, and then 'twill be no longer neceſſary to write in favour of Tranſubſtantiation. There will be no need of this courſe for a Reconciliation with</hi> Rome, <hi>and regaining peoples favour; for when the face of things ſhall be changed, this worlds wiſdom will be uſeleſs.</hi> Here is my crime, this the ſpark that has ſet all on fire. <hi>We</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 11. ch. 9. page 1131.</note> 
                           <hi>underſtand,</hi> ſays he, <hi>this language, and Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>knows well enough what he has ſaid himſelf, and what interpretation his words will bear. He means then the Author of the</hi> Perpetuity <hi>wrote not of Tranſubſtantiation by perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but out of policy, and for worldly reſpects. For when a Catholick Divine defends the Church to which he is united, if he believes what he ſays, we muſt not ſearch for other reaſons of his undertaking the common cauſe of the Church in whoſe truth he places his hope of Salvation deſerves ſufficiently to be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. So that to charge the Author of the</hi> Perpetuity <hi>to write only out of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical and worldly reſpects, is to charge him with not believing what he writes, and to give this account of it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THIS paſſion is a ſtrange thing. Had Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> conſidered theſe words with leſs heat, he would have found nothing in 'em of what he ſaw at firſt. I confeſs they may be underſtood in this ſenſe that this affair was politically manag'd, and with reſpect to the obtaining the favour of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and regain the peoples good will, and that this is a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſdom: But 'twill not be found in 'em, <hi>That the Author of the</hi> Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:41961:332"/> 
                           <hi>did not write by perſuaſion,</hi> but <hi>only thro policy,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd. This he will not find. Why then does he extend my words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their natural ſignification, and why does he wrong a man ſo ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly on the imagination he ſaid what he did not? <hi>We underſtand,</hi> ſays he, <note place="margin">The Book en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>The Port Royal and Geneva of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the moſt holy Sacrament of the Altar.</hi>
                           </note> 
                           <hi>this language.</hi> He ſhews plainly he does not underſtand it, ſeeing he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges me with ſaying what I did not, and draws his Commentary only from himſelf, and not from my words. Had I reproach'd Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> with the publick Writings printed againſt him, wherein he is accuſed for formally oppoſing the Doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation, and the Real Preſence by a propoſition to be met with in his Book of the frequent Communion? Had I told him that of late his opinion on the Euchariſt has been publickly in a Letter treated as <hi>ſuſpicious,</hi> that he has been told, <hi>That if he be unwilling,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Anſwer to the requeſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Book 2. ch. 6. p. 187.</note> 
                           <hi>together with his friends to be of intelligence with</hi> Geneva, <hi>he muſt change the act of the adoration which they perform aſſiſting at the Maſs to the Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Hoſt;</hi> for they ſay only, <hi>I adore thee raiſed on the Croſs, at the general judgment, and at the right hand of the Father, without any mention of adoring him being preſent in the Church.</hi> Had I ſeverely applied my ſelf to what he ſays ſomewhere in his Book, on the Principles of <hi>Des Cartes</hi> his Philoſophy, <hi>That God ſees in the matter, in the figures and forms only a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent order of parts,</hi> to conclude thence that this propoſition overthrows the exiſtence of accidents without a ſubject in the Euchariſt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that 'tis contrary to the common Doctrin of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it has been obſerv'd in a Letter Printed not long ſince, what tempeſts muſt I not have expected, ſeeing for having only hinted that there might be ſome policy in the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi>'s works I have raiſed ſuch a great diſturbance?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D</hi> proteſts <hi>he will never for my ſake diſpenſe with the</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Book 11. ch. 9. p. 1132.</note> 
                           <hi>rules of Juſtice, that he will never devine my ſecret intentions.</hi> Let him not then pretend to read in my heart, nor attribute to me a myſtical ſenſe which I never intended, nor is contained in my words. All thoſe that believe Tranſubſtantiation are not in a capacity of writing in its favour. Amongſt thoſe that are, how many do betake themſelves to other matters? Is it not then a very likely matter that a perſon who is at liberty to write on any ſubject, but pitches upon Tranſubſtantiation, is it not, I ſay, very likely his choice of this point is grounded on ſome worldly policy and carnal conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations? In attributing this to him we do nothing but what is very juſt and innocent. And this is all that my words ſignifie, to pretend to know more of my mind, is to attempt a thing which is poſſible only to God, and yet this Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> would do, that he might have ſome colour for his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>ARNA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>D</hi> I hope will ſuffer me likewiſe to tell him that what I ſaid touching ſome words of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> which I believed were not very advantageous to the common myſteries of our Religion, do neither reſpect his perſon nor the main of his ſentiments which I never pretended to handle, but only his expreſſions which I judged, and ſtill do judg to be too rough and vehement on points to which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſhew enough reſpect. We ought all of us to be very circumſpect in our ways of ſpeaking, to give no oecaſion to the open enemies of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel truths which we joyntly profeſs. This is my opinion, and my words will not admit fairly of any other explication. Can Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> wonder we ſhould be offended to hear theſe queſtions, <hi>Why are the immortality of</hi>

                           <hi>of the Old Teſtament which are receiv'd into the Canon of the Jews? Why did not Jeſus Chriſt declare his Divinity in ſuch clear and preciſe terms that 'twere impoſſible to elude them? What may the Pagans ſay on what the Church teaches concerning Original Sin, and this inconceivable tranſmiſſion of a crime, which is a ſpiritual and voluntary action, to all the Sons of him that committed it, altho they could not have any part in his action, and of this dreadful condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of all humane nature for the fault of one man?</hi> Can he think it ſtrange we have been troubled to hear the difficulties which the myſtery of the Trinity contains called <hi>dreadful difficulties,</hi> and to find 'em exaggerated in this manner: <hi>Were a man in this point to be guided by his reaſon, he muſt needs ſtart back at theſe inconceivable verities. Should he pretend to make uſe of its lights to penetrate them, ſhe will only furniſh him with arms to combat them.</hi> Who can but be offended at the propoſitions which are in this laſt work of Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> on the ſubject of proofs which I alledged out of the <note place="margin">Book 10. ch. 6. p. 1042.</note> Holy Scripture for the Trinity. <hi>That this will be very rational in the mouth of a Catholick, becauſe he accompanies theſe proofs with the publick intelligence of the whole Church and of all tradition. But that theſe ſame proofs are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely weak in the mouth of a Calviniſt without authority, without poſſeſſion, and who renounces Tradition and the Churches Authority. That Mr.</hi> Claude, <note place="margin">Page 1043.</note> 
                           <hi>(who alledges the beſt part of what there is in the Scripture concerning the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Divinity of Jeſus Chriſt) overthrows the Socinians beyond all remedy, yet in ſuch a manner as is more likely to make 'em laugh than to convert 'em.</hi> I do not believe theſe queſtions or propoſitions are juſtifiable, take 'em how we we will; but ſuppoſing they were, it muſt be granted they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in ſuch rough, dangerous, and exceſſive terms, that 'tis for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick edification to avoid 'em, yea and to cenſure 'em.</p>
                        <p>BUT in fine, we muſt leave theſe Perſonal Differences which cannot but be diſpleaſing. And therefore we will come to the Preface of my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Father <hi>Noüet,</hi> which ſeems to have much incenſed Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> and ſeeing he ſeems to be much concerned at it, we will endeavour to ſatisfie him about it. What then does this Preface contain which is ſo troubleſom and grievous? I confeſs we have mention'd a matter of fact in it wherein theſe Gentlemen have been concern'd; to wit, that their Book was refuſed an Approbation: but this was a point which ſhew'd the reaſon why this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was publiſh'd againſt Father <hi>Noüet,</hi> a fact moreover that was true and known by every body. We have drawn thence a conſequence which was not advantageous to Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> 'tis true; but a conſequence which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry natural: for that Gentleman whoſe approbation was ſought for to this laſt work of Mr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> and who refuſed it, is a publick perſon who gives not his Approbations as a private man, but as holding a rank and very conſiderable employ in one of the moſt famous Univerſities in Europe. If the face of things has been ſince altered, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> knows the reaſon of it; and we too. We have uſed ſome expreſſions of raillery, and this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps has moſt troubled Mr. <hi>Arnaud;</hi> but who ever told him that raillery ought to be wholly baniſh'd from a Diſpute. Not to fetch examples elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, we know very well that theſe Gentlemen have oft uſed it in their Writings, and not without ſucceſs; and not to go further, Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has not abſtain'd from it in this laſt Book he wrote againſt me. I do not take it ill, for I had rather at any time ſee him merry than angry.</p>
                        <pb n="270" facs="tcp:41961:333"/>
                        <p>I complain'd in this Preface of my being brought in impertinently into the <hi>abuſes and nullities</hi> againſt the order of the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Paris.</hi> But I believe 'twill be now acknowledg'd that I had reaſon to admire what was ſaid therein of me, in charging me with <hi>inconceivable boldneſs</hi> in denying the moſt evident <hi>matters, and maintaining the moſt falſe ones.</hi> This has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd my making a more general complaint, which is, that theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men omit no occaſion of teſtifying their averſion to us in a very ſharp and ſevere manner, and many times without any pretence or cauſe. To ſay here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, as Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> does, that they never ſpeak otherwiſe than <hi>truly and</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Chap. 11. p. 1162.</note> 
                           <hi>juſtly, and herein only obſerve the Principles of their Religion,</hi> this is to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie further his paſſion, and aſſert a thing the leaſt favourable imaginable to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For here the queſtion is not concerning the main of our Controverſies, nor whether we have reaſon or not. This is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which we do not pretend to meddle with in a Preface, and when this ſhall be the point we ſhall be able to ſhew that 'tis neither with truth, nor reaſon that theſe Gentlemen ſpeak of us as they do. The queſtion here is touching the manner after which they ſpeak, ever rending us with injurious expreſſions? To ſay that 'tis their Religion which inſpires them with theſe motions, and perſuades them this way of proceeding is juſt and reaſonable, is to impute to their Religion a thing which will render it odious, and of which I believe 'tis no wiſe guilty; for how many perſons do we ſee who are no leſs Roman Catholicks than theſe Gentlemen, who ſpeak and write as well as they, and yet do not uſe their way of proceeding. If I have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed their affected animoſity to the deſire they have of freeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from all ſuſpicions that they held intelligence with us, what is there in all this which may juſtly offend them. Have not theſe ſuſpicions been made publick, and have we not ſeen Books Printed whoſe Titles declared more than bare ſuſpicions? This is a thing which I did not invent at leiſure, neither one of <hi>my conjectures,</hi> nor <hi>a poſſible Romance,</hi> nor a particular ſecret which I have imprudently divulged, but a matter of fact which others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides my ſelf have publiſh'd, and which is known by every body. Is Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> offended at my imputing to him the deſire of clearing himſelf from this ſuſpicion? I wiſh with all my heart this were the occaſion of his wrath, neither would I complain in this caſe, to be its ſacrifice. But I am afraid that in turning things on this ſide, I ſhall pull on my ſelf a new quarrel more terrible than the firſt. What reaſon has he then to be angry? We are the only ſufferers in all this, we ſuffer in the ſuſpicion, we ſuffer in the juſtification, we ſuffer in the manner of the juſtification. But God give us grace to ſuffer patiently, and we hope he will not refuſe us that of perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in our duty to him, and purſuing to the laſt <hi>truth with love,</hi> till we arrive at his Kingdom, where we ſhall find reſt after our labors, and where our reproach will be turn'd into glory.</p>
                        <p>AND here I ſhall finiſh this Chapter and Book, and intreat Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> not to take any thing ill which I have ſaid to him, and to conſider that I maintain my Cauſe, a Cauſe of whoſe Goodneſs and Juſtice I cannot in the leaſt doubt. Let him not think I have been ſet on work by a ſpirit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, I naturally hate it, and ſeveral perſons of Honor and Probity know I engaged in this Controverſie much againſt my will, my temper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining me rather to live retired and quiet. Neither let him think I thought of diminiſhing in any ſort the Reputation which he has acquired in the world. I take it as a great honor to be found in the liſts with him; and as
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:41961:333"/> to his perſon, whatſoever ſharpneſs he has uſed towards me, he ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways find me reſpecting his ingenious qualifications. If he be diſpleaſed to find himſelf deceived in the great hopes which he conceiv'd touching the Greeks, Armenians, and other Eaſtern Churches, this will ſhew him he muſt not always judg of things from their firſt appearances. That which deceived him is, that he has taken for the true Greek Church a Party of Greeks which has been a long time a forming and which the reſt call <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which is to ſay, thoſe who are in their hearts and opinions Latins, altho outwardly profeſſors of the Greek Rites, and live amongſt the reſt in the ſame Communion. 'Twas this Party who for ſo long a time oppoſed <hi>Meletus</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Cyril</hi> his Succeſſor, afterwards Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and who in fine o'rewhelm'd <hi>Cyril</hi> by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> as I have elſewhere ſaid that <hi>Allatius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has acknowledged, and as I proved in the 12th. Chapter of the ſaid Book. Since this great Victory which was follow'd by the promotion of <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Beroe</hi> the Jeſuits Diſciple, and a great favorer of the Latins, to the Patriarchate of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> I do not doubt but this Party has mightily ſtrengthen'd it ſelf, and that ſeveral amongſt 'em have declared themſelves more loudly and openly than they did before. In effect 'twas about this time that a certain Greek of this Party called <hi>Meletus Syrigus</hi> wrote a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm which was ſign'd in the two pretended condemnations of <hi>Cyril Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car,</hi> the one under <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Beroe,</hi> and the other under <hi>Parthenius,</hi> with this Title <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which is to ſay, <hi>An Orthodox Confeſſion of the Catholick Apoſtolical and Eaſtern Church,</hi> in which he aſſerts the converſion of the ſubſtances of Bread and Wine into thoſe of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, with the ſubſiſtence of accidents without a ſubject, and uſes the very term of <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. If Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> has meant by the Greek Church the perſons of that Party, I have already declared to him, and again tell him that I have not diſputed againſt him. We do not pretend to diſpute the Conqueſts of the Miſſions and Seminaries, let him peaceably enjoy 'em, we mean only the true Greeks, who retain the Doctrin and ancient expreſſions of their Church. And as to thoſe, we are certain of two things, the one that they hold not the Tranſubſtantiation of the Latins, which I believe I have clearly proved; and the other that they alone ought to be called the true Greek Church, altho the contrary Party were the moſt prevalent, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the Patriarchates. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> himſelf has told us that theſe Seats are diſpoſed of by the ſovereign authority of the Turks to thoſe that have moſt money, and we know moreover the great care that has been taken to eſtabliſh the Roman Doctrins in theſe Countries, thro the Neglect and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Prelates, Monks, and People, whether by inſtructing their Children, or gaining the Biſhops, or filling the Churches with the Scholars of Seminaries, and other like means which I have deſcrib'd at large in my ſecond Book. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> perhaps will anſwer that he likewiſe maintains on his ſide, that this Party which teaches Tranſubſtantiation is the true Greek Church, and the other but a Cabal of <hi>Cyril</hi>'s Diſciples. I anſwer, that to decide this queſtion, we need only examin which of theſe two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties retains the Doctrin and Expreſſions of the ancient Greeks; for that which has this Character muſt be eſteem'd the true Greek Church, and not that which has receiv'd novelties unknown to their Fathers. Now we have clearly ſhew'd that the converſion of Subſtances, Tranſubſtantiation, and the Real Preſence, are Doctrins and Expreſſions, of which the Greeks of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages have had no knowledg; whence it follows that the Party which
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:41961:334"/> admits theſe Doctrins and Expreſſions, are a parcel of Innovators which muſt not be regarded as if they were the true Greek Church. Let Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud,</hi> and thoſe who read this Diſpute, always remember that the firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> is that in the 11th. Century at the time of <hi>Berenger</hi>'s condemnation, the Greeks held the Real Preſence and Tranſubſtantiation, that this is the time which he choſe, and term'd his fix'd point, to prove from hence that theſe Doctrins were of the firſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of Religion; and conſequently perpetual in the Church. Which I deſire may be carefully obſerved to prevent another illuſion, which may be offered us, by transferring the queſtion of the Greeks of that time to the Greeks at this, and to hinder Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> and others from triumphing over us when it ſhall happen that the Miſſions and Seminaries, and all the reſt of the intrigues which are made uſe of ſhall devour the whole Land of <hi>Greece.</hi> For in this caſe the advantage drawn hence againſt us will be of no value; 'twill neither hence follow, that the Doctrins in queſtion have been perplex'd in the Church, nor that the Greek Church held 'em in the time of <hi>Berenger</hi>'s condemnation; and what I ſay touching the Greeks, I ſay likewiſe touching the other Eaſtern Churches over which the Roman Church extends its Miſſions and Care as well as the Greeks.</p>
                        <p>AS to what remains, let not Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> be offended that in the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his Book in general, I have every where ſhewed the little juſtice and ſolidity of his reaſonings, and eſpecially in the refutation of his firſt, ſixth, and tenth Book. I acknowledg he has wrote with much Wit, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy, and polite Language, and attribute to the defect of his ſubject, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I have noted to be amiſs, either in his Proofs, or Anſwers: but 'tis very true, the world never ſaw ſo many illuſions and ſuch great weakneſs, in a work of this nature; and all that I could do was to uſe great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcentions, in following him every where to ſet him ſtrait. I have only now to beſeech Almighty God to bleſs this my Labor, and as he has given me Grace to undertake and finiſh it, ſo he will make it turn to his Glory and the Churches Edification. <hi>AMEN.</hi>

                     <hi>THOSE that ſhall caſt their eyes on this Anſwer, will be at firſt apt to think theſe Critical Queſtions belong only to Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. Whereas we have here ſeveral important matters of fact, which are in a manner neceſſary to the full underſtanding of the Controverſie of the Euchariſt. The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>pretends we have forſaken the Ancient Faith, and that</hi> Berenger <hi>was one of the firſt who taught our Doctrin in the beginning of the 11th. Century. We on the contrary maintain 'tis the Roman Church that has departed from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Belief; and that 'twas</hi> Paſchaſus Ratbert, <hi>who in the beginning of the 9th. Century taught the Real Preſence, and the Subſtantial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. And to this in ſhort may he reduced the whole Controverſie which was between Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>and Mr.</hi> Arnaud.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>has ſtrenuouſly and clearly ſhewed that as many Authors as were of any Repute im the 9th. Century, have oppoſed the Doctrin of</hi> Paſchaſus; <hi>and that conſequently</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>muſt be reſpected as a real Innovator. Now amongſt theſe Writers, Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>produces</hi> John Scot, <hi>or</hi> Erigenus, <hi>and</hi> Bertram, <hi>or</hi> Ratram <hi>a Religious of</hi> Corby, <hi>two of the greateſt Perſonages of that Age, and ſhews they wrote both of 'em againſt the Novelties which</hi> Paſchaſus <hi>had broach'd; that one of 'em Dedicated his Book to</hi> Charles the Bald, <hi>King of</hi> France, <hi>and the other likewiſe wrote his by the ſame King's Order. That the firſt having lived ſome time in this Prince's Court, died at laſt in</hi> England <hi>in great reputation for his holineſs of Life; that the other was always eſteem'd and reverenced as the Defender of the Church, which ſeems to be deciſive in our favour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Arnaud <hi>on his ſide, finding himſelf toucht to the quick by the conſequence of theſe Proofs, has uſed his laſt and greateſt Endeavours to overthrow or weaken 'em. And for this purpoſe has publiſh'd at the end of his Book two Diſſertations, the one under his own name, and the other under the name of a Religious of St.</hi> Genevieve, <hi>whoſe name is not mention'd. In the firſt, which is under the name of the</hi> Religious, <hi>he does two things; for firſt, he endeavours to perſuade that the Book of</hi> the Body and Blood of our Lord <hi>is not in effect</hi> Ratram'<hi>s, but</hi> John Scot'<hi>s: And in the ſecond place he endeavours to decry</hi> John Scot, <hi>and deprive him of all Eſteem and Authority. In the other</hi> Diſſertation, <hi>Mr.</hi> Arnaud <hi>pretends that whoſoever was the Author of this Book, Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>has not rightly comprehended the ſenſe of it, and that this Book does not combat the Doctrin of</hi> Paſchaſus. <hi>And thus Mr.</hi> Arnaud
<pb facs="tcp:41961:336"/> 
                     <hi>pretends to diſcharge himſelf of Mr.</hi> Claude'<hi>s proof, ſo that to take away from him this laſt ſubterfuge, and re-eſtabliſh this part of Mr.</hi> Claude'<hi>s proof, it is neceſſary to ſhew clearly that the little Book of</hi> our Lords Body and Blood, <hi>is in effect</hi> Ratram'<hi>s, and that this Book is directly oppoſite to the Doctrin of</hi> Paſchaſus, <hi>and that</hi> John Scot <hi>is an Author whoſe Teſtimony is of great weight and authority: which is what I have undertaken to do in this Anſwer: And I hope theſe kind of Elucidations will not be deemed unprofitable, or unpleaſant. Moreover, I did not think my ſelf oblig'd to enter into a particular Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the ſecond Diſſertation touching</hi> Bertram'<hi>s Book, becauſe the Hiſtory which I make of this Book, the judgment which thoſe of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>have made of it at ſeveral times, with what Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>alledges concerning it in the 11th. Chapter of his ſixth Book, are ſufficient to ſhew clearly that this Author has directly combated the Doctrin of</hi> Paſchaſus, <hi>without offering to tire the Readers with trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom repetitions. Moreover, we hope to give the Publick in a ſhort time a tranſlation of</hi> Bertram'<hi>s Book, which being but a ſmall Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, requires only an hours reading, in which every one may ſee with their own eyes what's his true ſenſe, without a more tedious ſearch after it in Mr.</hi> Arnaud'<hi>s Arguments, or mine.</hi>

                        <p>IT was without doubt from the ſame reaſon that in 1571. the Divines of <note place="margin">Indic. Belgic. voce Bertramus.</note>

                        <p>THE Preſident <hi>Mauguin</hi> ſeeing then on one hand the Book could not <note place="margin">Diſſert. Hiſt. c. 17. p. 134, 135.</note> be denied to be true, and, acknowledging moreover that this <hi>Bertram</hi> to whom 'tis attributed, is no other than <hi>Ratramnus</hi> whom he lately mention'd with ſuch great Elogies, as being the defender of the Doctrin of the Church concerning Divine Grace, he, I ſay, believ'd 'twas beſt to attempt the juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him by any means from the crime of Hereſie touching the Euchariſt. And for this effect has bethought himſelf of maintaining that <hi>Ratramnus</hi> in the Book in queſtion, defends the ſame Doctrin which <hi>Paſchaſus Ratbert</hi> defended in that which he wrote on the ſame ſubject; that both one and the other, to wit, <hi>Ratramnus</hi> and <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> had to deal with the ſame Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, to wit, certain Stercoraniſts (who according to Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the 9th. Century) that they both of 'em admirably well agree in defending the Catholick Church; ſo that there can be no charge of Hereſie brought againſt <hi>Bertram,</hi> as they of his Communion had hitherto done without any reaſon.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>HERMAN</hi> Canon of <hi>Beauvais</hi> has approved of this ſentiment of Mr. <hi>Mauguin</hi> in a Letter to Mr. <hi>De St. Beuve,</hi> Printed in 1652. under the name of <hi>Hierom ab Angelo forti;</hi> and 'tis by this means he endeavours to defend <hi>Janſenius</hi> his Diſciples againſt Mr. <hi>Deſmareſts,</hi> Profeſſor in Divinity at <hi>Groningue,</hi> who argued againſt Tranſubſtantiation from the authority of this ſame <hi>Ratramnus,</hi> whom the Gentlemen of the <hi>Port Royal</hi> quoted as one of the moſt famous Witneſſes of the Belief of the Church againſt the novelties of <hi>Molina.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IT ſeems alſo that Mr. <hi>De St. Beuve</hi> does not diſapprove of this opinion of Mr. <hi>Mauguin</hi> and Mr. <hi>Herman</hi> in his Manuſcript Treatiſe of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, as we may collect from the Preface of <hi>D' Luc d' Achery,</hi> on the ſecond Tome of his <hi>Spicilege.</hi> Yet by a ſtrange kind of injuſtice after the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Cardinal <hi>Du Perron,</hi> and others who have ſeen <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, he ſtill ſuſpects it to have ſuffered ſome alteration. Howſoever he would have us remember that <hi>Ratramnus</hi> died in the boſom of the Church, and bear with his offenſive expreſſions. This is the part which theſe two Gentlemen have taken for the preſervation of <hi>Ratramnus</hi> his authority, whoſe teſtimony is uſeful to 'em in other matters.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>CELLOT</hi> the Jeſuit on the contrary, deſigning in his Hiſtory of <hi>Gottheſchalc,</hi> and in his Appendixes, to oppoſe the ſentiments of Mr. <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guin</hi> in the ſubject of Grace, and to diſcredit its Champions, has attackt the perſon of <hi>Ratramnus.</hi> He does indeed acknowledg him for the true Author of the Book <hi>of the Body and Blood of our Lord,</hi> but he does all that he is able to diſcredit it, and bereave it of all the Authority which theſe other Gentlemen attribute to it. Howſoever, he yields it to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants as being for them, and maintains with <hi>Poſſevin,</hi> that altho this Book may be read with corrections, yet Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. has done well in prohibiting it.</p>
                        <pb n="280" facs="tcp:41961:338"/>
                        <p>OTHERS of better judgments in the Romiſh Communion have clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foreſeen that if what <hi>Cellot</hi> the Jeſuit offers againſt <hi>Ratramnus</hi> is of uſe to him againſt the Diſciples of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> and if his way of proceeding be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous againſt the Adverſaries which he had at his back, 'twas not the ſame in reſpect of us. For as faſt as he deprived his Adverſaries of ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous an Author as <hi>Ratramnus,</hi> in decrying him for an Heretick on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Euchariſt, he yielded him to us without any diſpute, and by this means does himſelf furniſh us with a very authentick Author againſt Tranſubſtantiation and the Real Preſence. They have believed then that to prevent the falling into this inconveniency, they muſt invent ſome other new means, which on one hand might be leſs bold, and more likely than is that of Mr. <hi>Mauguin,</hi> which cannot reaſonably be maintain'd, and which on the other would not give us ſo great advantage as Father <hi>Cellot</hi> has given us in placing <hi>Ratramnus</hi> abſolutely on our ſide.</p>
                        <p>AND this is what Mr. <hi>Marca</hi> the deceaſed Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> has ſeem'd to have done, when he offered as a new diſcovery that the Book in queſtion is of <hi>John Scot,</hi> or <hi>Erigenus.</hi> For by means of this opinion he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſecure to <hi>Ratramnus</hi> his whole authority and reputation, and attribute at the ſame time to the Book of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord,</hi> the infamy of an heretical piece, according to the Decree of the Roman Cenſurers. We may charge Mr. <hi>De Marca</hi> with inconſtancy, ſeeing that in his French Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Euchariſt, which was publiſh'd ſince his death by the Abbot <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get</hi> his Couſin-german, he acknowledged that <hi>Bertram</hi> and <hi>Ratram</hi> were but one and the ſame Author, and that the Book of the <hi>Body and Blood of our Lord</hi> is truly of <hi>Ratramnus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>HOWSOEVER Mr. <hi>De Marca</hi> affirms in his Letter to <hi>De Luc d'</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Tome 2. <hi>Spicil.</hi>
                           </note> 
                           <hi>Achery,</hi> wrote in 1657. Firſt, That the Book of the <hi>Body and Blood of our Lord</hi> is not of <hi>Ratramnus,</hi> as the learned have thought. Secondly, That 'tis <hi>John</hi>'s, ſurnamed <hi>Scot,</hi> or <hi>Erigenus.</hi> Thirdly, That <hi>John Scot</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging this Book was contrary to the Doctrin of the Church, publiſh'd it under the name of <hi>Ratramnus,</hi> by a famous Impoſture, to give it the more weight. Fourthly, That this Book is then the ſame which was condemned in the Council of <hi>Verſeile</hi> by <hi>Leo</hi> IX. as <hi>Lanfranc</hi> reports, and was at length burnt in the Council of <hi>Rome</hi> under <hi>Nicholas</hi> II. in 1059. And thus does he reject his former opinion thro human weakneſs, from which the greateſt Wits are not exempt, and wherein a man eaſily falls when 'tis his intereſt to be of another mind.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>De Marca</hi> well perceiv'd what a troubleſom thing it was to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Faith, to ſay that <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> which is, as it were, the head of it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Hypotheſis of the Proteſtants, was oppoſed by all the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and famous men which were then in the Church. He alſo well foreſaw that thoſe who would reflect on the perſon of <hi>Ratram,</hi> would be extremely ſurpriz'd to ſee that upon the conteſts to which the Doctrin of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> gave birth, <hi>Charles the Bald</hi> having conſulted <hi>Ratram,</hi> this great man took part with <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Adverſaries. He knew likewiſe that 'twas this ſame <hi>Ratram,</hi> who was conſulted on the ſubject of Grace by the ſame <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> and who ſhew'd himſelf ſo zealous for the truth, that he feared not to withſtand three times <hi>Hincmar</hi> his Arch-Biſhop, as Mr. <hi>Mauguin</hi> has <note place="margin">Diſſert. Hiſt. c. 17. p. 135.</note> obſerv'd, That this <hi>Ratram</hi> was ſo famous in his time, that after theſe bick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erings
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:41961:338"/> with <hi>Hincmar, Hincmar</hi> himſelf and the other French Prelates, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion'd him to anſwer in their name the objections of the Greeks in the diſpute which aroſe between them and the Latins. There was no likelihood of making ſuch a one paſs for an Heretick. Moreover, Mr. <hi>Marca</hi> could not deny but that the Book of our <hi>Lords Body and Blood</hi> ought to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to <hi>Ratram,</hi> ſhould we refer our ſelves to the teſtimony of <hi>Sigebert.</hi> He himſelf calls it <hi>the little Book publiſhed by the Proteſtants, under the name</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Epiſt. ad De Luc d' Ach. T. 2. Spicil.</note> 
                           <hi>of</hi> Bertram, <hi>and attributed to</hi> Ratram <hi>by</hi> Sigebert <hi>and</hi> Trithemius. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved likewiſe he had gotten a certain proof that ſince the 9th. Century this Book bore the title of <hi>Ratram,</hi> becauſe the anonymous Author publiſh'd by <hi>Cellot,</hi> reckons <hi>Ratram</hi> one of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi>'s Adverſaries. And Mr. <hi>De Marca</hi> took this anonymous Author for an Author of the 9th. Century, as <hi>Perron</hi> alſo thought. What remedy is there to theſe inconveniencies which appear to be of ſo great conſequence? For, for to take the part of Mr. <hi>Mauguin,</hi> and to ſay that the Book in queſtion contains nothing but what is conformable to the belief of the Roman Church, is even according to him an unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able aſſertion.</p>
                        <p>TO extricate himſelf out of theſe perplexities, Mr. <hi>Marca</hi> believ'd it beſt to maintain that <hi>John Scot</hi> was the true Author of this Book, that 'twas <hi>John Scot</hi> himſelf that fathered it on <hi>Ratram,</hi> and that <hi>Cellot</hi>'s anonymous Author being ignorant of this fact was deceived in what he wrote of it. And this is the happy invention by which Mr. <hi>De Marca</hi> thought he might procure great advantages to his Party. Firſt, He reduces both <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Adverſaries to one, which already diminiſhes the number of 'em. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, He delivers <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> from the hands of an adverſary who was conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held for a moſt Orthodox Divine in his time. Thirdly, By this means he decries this Book it ſelf by attributing it to an Author, who in the 9th. Century drew on himſelf ſome Cenſures from the Councils of <hi>Valence</hi> and <hi>Langres</hi> touching the queſtions of Grace, and whom the Roman Church condemned in the 11th. at <hi>Verceil,</hi> and at <hi>Rome</hi> on the matter of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt. Fourthly, He diſcharges his Church of the reproach of having condemned in the 11th. Century, and ſtill at this day condemning a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin which was taught in the 9th. by an Orthodox Author, ſuch as was <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram.</hi> Again, the name of <hi>John Scot</hi> has appeared to him very proper for the giving ſome colour to his diſcovery, becauſe that in effect <hi>John Scot</hi> wrote likewiſe a Book on the ſubject of the Euchariſt which he dedicated to <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> and that this Book is loſt, whether by chance or on purpoſe, as it has alſo hapned to others, we cannot gueſs.</p>
                        <p>WE may with great likelihood ſay that Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> and his friends have had the ſame intereſts as Mr. <hi>De Marca.</hi> But we may alſo add that they have had a particular reaſon which much contributes to make 'em embrace Mr. <hi>De Marca</hi>'s opinion, and maintain with him that <hi>Ratram</hi> is not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Book in queſtion, but <hi>John Scot,</hi> or <hi>Erigenus.</hi> Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> has <note place="margin">Anſwer to the Perpetuity, part 3. ch. 1.</note> ſhewed them in the famous Diſpute which they have had, that having once eſteemed <hi>Ratram</hi> for the Oracle of his time, and for the great defender of the Orthodox Doctrin of Divine Grace, 'tis not fair to refuſe his teſtimony now on the Euchariſt, and treat him as an Author of ſmall importance, that this is an expoſing of a man's ſelf plainly to the reproach of injuſtice and lightneſs. They muſt then deliver themſelves at any rate from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of this Book, and abſolutely deny that 'tis <hi>Ratram</hi>'s. But the way to do it handſomly is difficult, ſeeing the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> ſeems to
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:41961:339"/> have acknowledg'd that <hi>Bertram</hi> and <hi>Ratram</hi> were but one and the ſame perſon, and that he was the real Author of the Book in queſtion. To get out of this vexatious ſuit, a Religious of S. <hi>Genevieve,</hi> whoſe name is not mention'd, opportunely offers himſelf. He ſends a Diſſertation touching <hi>John Scot</hi> and <hi>Bertram,</hi> wherein he makes a third Party between Mr. <hi>De Marca</hi> and the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> to wit, that the Book is <hi>John Scot's;</hi> but an obſcure and perplex'd piece. Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> adopts this Diſſertation, and publiſhes it at the end of his Book. So that properly neither the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> retracts, nor Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> who contradicts him; but an anonymous Religious who gives us his conjectures. And by this means all is made whole again, and the Confeſſion which the Author of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity</hi> has made is no more at fartheſt than the error of one man.</p>

                              <hi>That what the Author of the</hi> Diſſertation <hi>would reform in the Opinion of Mr.</hi> De Marca, <hi>does not at all make it the more probable.</hi>

                        </argument>
                        <p>THAT which the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi> has changed in the conjecture of Monſieur <hi>De Marca,</hi> to make it a little more toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, may be reduced to theſe three things. Firſt, He will have the ſuppoſition of this Book to be made, not by <hi>John Scot</hi> himſelf in the 9th. Century, as Mr. <hi>De Marca</hi> ſays, but by <hi>Berenger,</hi> or thoſe of his Party towards the end of the 11th. Secondly, He pretends that in reſpect of the Title, the ſuppoſition has not been made barely under the name of <hi>Ratram;</hi> but that thoſe who have made the change have made the Book paſs under the name of <hi>Bertram,</hi> or that of <hi>Bertramnus,</hi> or under that of <hi>Ratram,</hi> or <hi>Intram,</hi> or <hi>Ratramnus,</hi> or perhaps under ſeveral of theſe different names, but indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Copies. Thirdly, He will have it to be in reſpect of the ſenſe of the Book but an obſcure and perplex'd piece, whereas Mr. <hi>De. Marca</hi> openly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges it to be heretical, incapable of a good explication, and juſtly cenſured.</p>
                        <p>BUT we cannot conceive how Mr. <hi>De Marca</hi>'s conjecture will appear more probable by theſe new corrections. In effect if it be unjuſt in Mr. <hi>De Marca</hi> to accuſe without proof, witneſſes, or ground, and even without any probability <hi>John Scot</hi> of an impoſture ſo great as this is, what judgment muſt we make of the accuſation which Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> brings under the name of the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation,</hi> againſt <hi>Berenger</hi> or his followers? Who has revealed to him the myſtery of this ſuppoſition which he ſo hiſtorically deals out to us? Where are the Adverſaries of <hi>Berenger</hi> who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached him with this deceit, or thoſe of his Party? Where are the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts which help him to this diſcovery? 'Tis apparent there needs a great ſtock of confidence to form accuſations of this conſequence without any proof. For my part I may accuſe the Diſciples of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> with more likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood for having attributed their Maſters Books to names of far greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown than his. Whilſt I write this, I have before me the Treatiſe <hi>of the Perpetual Virginity of the Holy Virgin,</hi> of which in fine we know <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> to be the Author. Yet has this Book paſſed hitherto for S. <hi>Hildephonſus</hi>'s, Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Toledo;</hi> and in a Manuſcript which I have by me, it appears that this ſuppoſition is made deſignedly by a Prieſt of the 10th. Century,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:41961:339"/> named <hi>Gomezan,</hi> who pretends that this Book was brought from <hi>Spain</hi> by a Biſhop called <hi>Gotiſcalc:</hi> and this good man has carried on the ſuppoſition ſo far as to corrupt the Catalogue of S. <hi>Hildephonſus</hi> his works, by inſerting in 'em theſe words which are to be found in the Edition of <hi>Miroeus</hi> as well as in the Manuſcript. <hi>He wrote—a little Book of the Virginity of the Holy Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, againſt three Infidels.</hi> We know likewiſe that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Book touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Euchariſt, was father'd on the famous <hi>Raban,</hi> as appears from the <hi>Cologn</hi> Edition in 1551. and from the Manuſcripts of which the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi> ſays he has another of 'em in his hands; altho it be certain that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> is the Author of this Book, and that <hi>Raban</hi> was of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion to <hi>Paſchaſus.</hi> But without ſuch appearance, and without any ground, proof, or Witneſſes, we muſt be gravely told, that <hi>Berenger</hi> or his Diſciples, who were not convinced nor accuſed of any ſuch thing, have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered on <hi>Bertram</hi> the Book which was condemned at <hi>Verſeil</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> and which is in effect <hi>John Scots,</hi> and that ſix hundred years after we muſt be informed of this pretended ſuppoſition, which no body before ever imagin'd: what is this but impoſing on the Readers credulity.</p>
                        <p>THE ſecond change which the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi> makes of Mr. <hi>De Marca</hi>'s ſentiment is a mere cavil that has no foundation, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter. In effect Mr. <hi>De Marca</hi> as well before as ſince his new conjecture, has acknowledg'd that <hi>Bertram</hi> and <hi>Ratram</hi> are but one and the ſame.</p>
                        <p>AND as to what that Author imagins in the third place that Mr. <hi>De Marca</hi> was miſtaken in his maintaining that <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Book is plainly againſt Tranſubſtantiation, and the Real Preſence; whereas it ought only to paſs for an obſcure and perplex'd Writing, 'tis evident this was to ſave the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity</hi>'s reputation. In effect if he had not this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, how could he content himſelf with barely treating this Book as obſcure and perplex'd, ſeeing he himſelf ſuppoſes that 'tis <hi>John Scots?</hi> Firſt, Does he not know that <hi>Scot</hi>'s Book was condemned by the Synod of <hi>Verceil</hi> as an Heretical piece. Secondly, That 'twas ſo before at <hi>Paris</hi> by a kind <note place="margin">Durand. Troar. de Corp. &amp; Sang. Chr. <hi>part 9.</hi> De Praedeſt. cap. 31. Epiſt. ad Berenger. in Lanf. oper.</note> of Synod who cenſured it in the ſame terms. Thirdly, That another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at <hi>Rome</hi> cauſed it to be burnt ſix years after the Council of <hi>Verceil.</hi> Fourthly, That <hi>John Scot</hi>'s Book was compoſed on this platform, <hi>That the Sacrament of the Altar is not the true Body nor true Blood of our Lord, but only a memorial of his true Body and Blood,</hi> as <hi>Hincmar</hi> and <hi>Aſcelin</hi> ſay. Fifthly, That <hi>Berenger</hi> has taken the Book of <hi>John Scot</hi> for an authentick teſtimony of his Faith, and <hi>Lanfranc</hi> alſo for an avowed adverſary of <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſus.</hi> Sixthly, That in the 12th. Century <hi>Cellot</hi>'s anonymous Author te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies the Author of this Book was reſpected as an adverſary to <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> in the ſame manner as he had been in the preceding Century. Seventhly, That ſuppoſing <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Book be <hi>John Scot</hi>'s, whatſoever I now mention'd muſt be referred to him. Eighthly, That in effect <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Book was attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to <hi>Oecolampadius.</hi> Ninthly, That it was proſcribed by I know not how many expurgatory Indexes. Tenthly, That the Divines of <hi>Doway</hi> and others with 'em, not being able to admit the Doctrin, have affirm'd it has been altered. In fine, that the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi> himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges that <hi>Berenger</hi> or his Diſciples conſidered this Book as a Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler for 'em, which 'twas their intereſt to preſerve at the expence of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt fraud and treachery.</p>
                        <p>DARE the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi> ſay that <hi>Hincmar</hi> has underſtood
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:41961:340"/> the ſentiment of <hi>John Scot</hi> better than <hi>John Scot</hi> himſelf, that the Councils of the 11th. Century have raſhly condemned a Writing which at moſt was but an obſcure and perplex'd one? That Pope <hi>Leo</hi> IX. <hi>Nicholas</hi> II. and the 113 Biſhops which conſtrained <hi>Berenger</hi> to burn <hi>John Scot</hi>'s Book were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in it, that <hi>Berenger</hi> nor his Adverſaries, nor his Diſciples, have not comprehended what made for 'em or againſt 'em during ſeveral years Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and that in fine the 12th. Century remain'd in as great an ignorance? I wonder how the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> can ſpeak of this Book as they do; which is to ſay, that it is obſcure and perplexed, in ſuppoſing <hi>John Scot</hi> to be the Author of it. I can ſcarcely believe that if theſe Gentlemen do ſatisfie themſelves, they can alſo ſatisfie the ingenuous of their own party that have read it. But that I may handle more fully this point, I intend to eſtabliſh clearly two things, Firſt, That this Book of the Body and Blood of our Lord publiſh'd under the name of <hi>Bertram,</hi> is in effect <hi>Ratram</hi>'s, and not <hi>John Scot</hi>'s. Secondly, That the authority of this Book will not ceaſe to be very conſiderable, ſuppoſing <hi>John Scot</hi> were the Author of it. I hope I ſhall commodiouſly reduce under theſe two heads, whatſoever the Author has treated of greateſt importance in his <hi>Diſſertation.</hi>

                              <hi>That</hi> Ratram <hi>is the Author of the Book of</hi> our Lords Body and Blood, <hi>publiſh'd under the name of</hi> Bertram.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>TO confirm this truth, I ſhall firſt bring as convincing proofs as can be brought for theſe kind of Facts. Secondly, I ſhall produce the acknowledgment of the moſt learned Romaniſts who have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged this verity, even ſince ſome of 'em have queſtion'd it. Laſtly, I ſhall ſhew that this is not a diſcovery which <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> firſt made, and that whatſoever the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi> brings againſt that Prelates proofs cannot overthrow them. See here the proofs.</p>
                        <p>FIRST, <hi>Sigebert</hi> a Monk of <hi>Gemblou,</hi> attributes in his Catalogue of Eccleſiaſtical Writers the Book of <hi>our Lords Body and Blood</hi> to the Author of the Book of <hi>Predeſtination:</hi> Now this Book of <hi>Predeſtination</hi> is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be <hi>Ratram</hi>'s. And in effect altho <hi>Suffridus Petrus,</hi> who cauſed <hi>Sigebert</hi>'s Catalogue to be Printed, has inſerted the name of <hi>Bertram</hi> in his Edition, he does himſelf remark, that two Manuſcripts, one of the Abby of <hi>Gemblou,</hi> the other of the Priory of <hi>Vauvert,</hi> had diſtinctly the name of <hi>Ratram,</hi> and not that of <hi>Bertram.</hi> This teſtimony of <hi>Sigebert</hi> is conſiderable for three reaſons. Firſt, Becauſe he was one of the moſt inquiſitive Hiſtorians of his time, as appears by his Chronicle. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Becauſe he did not write his Catalogue till he had ſpent the greateſt part of his life in the reading of the Authors of which he ſpeaks in his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue. Thirdly, Becauſe that having lived a great while in the 11th. Century (for he died but in the year 1113.) he had a particular knowledg of what paſſed in the Diſputes between <hi>Berenger</hi> and his Adverſaries, and the Authors which were alledged on either hand.</p>
                        <pb n="285" facs="tcp:41961:340"/>
                        <p>AS <hi>Trithemius</hi> in his Catalogue has followed <hi>Sigebert,</hi> excepting that he ſpoke more particularly of the Author of the Book of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord,</hi> and of <hi>Predeſtination;</hi> it is plain that altho it has likewiſe the name of <hi>Bertram,</hi> or <hi>Bertramnus,</hi> he deſign'd <hi>Ratramnus,</hi> and that the rather, that 'tis undeniable: Firſt, That there was no Author of <hi>Bertram</hi>'s name in the 9th. Century. Secondly, That the Elogies which he gives to <hi>Bertram</hi> are ſuitable only to <hi>Ratramnus,</hi> by the conſent of all learned men, That 'twould be a wonderful thing, for neither <hi>Trithemius</hi> nor <hi>Sigebert</hi> to mention a word of <hi>Ratramnus,</hi> one of the moſt famous Authors of the 9th. Century.</p>
                        <p>SECONDLY, an anonymous Author, who apparently wrote ſince <hi>Algerus,</hi> which is to ſay, about the year 1140. formally attributes to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram</hi> to have wrote a Treatiſe of the Body and Blood of our Lord againſt the ſentiments of <hi>Paſchaſus Ratbert,</hi> and dedicated it to the French King <hi>Charles the Bald.</hi> Now this is what agrees preciſely with the Book which bears the name of <hi>Bertram.</hi> For firſt, he directly decides againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> altho he does not name him. Secondly, It is dedicated to King <hi>Charles.</hi> Thirdly, The arguments which the anonymous Author relates as being common to <hi>Raban</hi> and <hi>Ratram,</hi> are ſound in the Book pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd under the name of <hi>Bertram.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THIRDLY, The ſtyle and Hypotheſis of this Book of <hi>Bertram</hi> are wholly the ſame with thoſe of other Writings of <hi>Ratram,</hi> as I ſhall make appear. But before we come to this, behold another proof which alone is ſufficient to decide our queſtion.</p>
                        <p>FOURTHLY, There are Manuſcripts of the Book of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord,</hi> which bear the ſame name of <hi>Ratram.</hi> Firſt, Thoſe that in 1532. cauſed this Book to be Printed at <hi>Cologn,</hi> expreſly obſerve, that they preferred the name of <hi>Bertram</hi> before any other name of the ſame Author, which appeared to them leſs known. <hi>Let the Reader know,</hi> ſay they, <hi>that altho the name of this Author is to be met with elſewhere expreſs'd in another manner, yet this name</hi> (to wit of <hi>Bertram) being moſt common and familiar, ought to be preferred before any other.</hi> This other name can be none but that of <hi>Ratramnus,</hi> which appear'd to them leſs known than that of <hi>Bertram,</hi> only becauſe that in 1531. which is to ſay, a year before the Edition of the Book of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord,</hi> the Catalogue of the Eccleſiaſtical Writers of <hi>Trithemius</hi> was publiſh'd at <hi>Cologn</hi> it ſelf, and therein mention made of this Author under the name of <hi>Bertram,</hi> and not under that of <hi>Ratram.</hi> Secondly, The Divines of <hi>Doway</hi> had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion ſome Manuſcripts of the Book of <hi>Our Lords Body and Blood</hi> under the name of <hi>Ratramnus,</hi> without which they could not ſay of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram,</hi> what they have ſaid.

                        <p>THESE proofs be convincing to rational men; the only thing which has rais'd any ſcruple is the name of <hi>Bertram,</hi> which ſome Tranſcribers, and thoſe that have publiſh'd it from theſe Copies, have put in, inſtead of the true name, which was <hi>Ratramnus:</hi> but this ſignifies little. For firſt, 'tis certain that <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Book was written in the 9th. Century, in which time
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:41961:341"/> there was no Author named <hi>Bertram:</hi> ſo that this muſt needs be a corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted name thro the ignorance of ſome Tranſcribers. It is then fitting to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute this Book to one of the Authors of thoſe times whoſe name comes neareſt to that of <hi>Bertram.</hi> Now 'tis certain there is none which comes nearer than <hi>Ratram. Theophilus Raynaud</hi> the Jeſuit has acknowledged this truth. <hi>How eaſie has it been,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to confound</hi> Bertram <hi>and</hi> Ratram <hi>in ſo great</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Erotem,</hi> page 132, 133.</note> 
                           <hi>an affinity and reſemblance of names.</hi> We may alledg two cauſes of this confuſion which are very probable: Firſt, 'Twas the cuſtom to give the name <hi>Beatus</hi> to illuſtrious men in the Church, inſtead of <hi>Sanctus,</hi> which has been ſince affectedly given 'em, of which there are thouſands of inſtances in Manuſcripts and Printed Books. 'Tis then very likely that ſome Tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers finding in Manuſcripts the Title of this Book, <hi>B. Ratrami,</hi> or <hi>Be. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trami,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Beati Ratramni,</hi> they have imprudently joyn'd all theſe Letters, and made thereof but one name. Thus in the Edition of <hi>Aldus,</hi> inſtead of reading <hi>P. Cornutus,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Publius Cornutus,</hi> they have joyn'd the Letters of the Manuſcript which ſhould be ſeparate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they have made the barbarous name of <hi>Phornutus.</hi> Secondly, It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the conformity of the letter B with the Letter R which in the ancient Impreſſions and Manuſcripts, differ only in one ſtroak, may have given way to this Error. The likeneſs of Capital Letters has produced like changes, the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi> himſelf tells us that in two Manuſcripts of the Abby of S. <hi>Victor,</hi> the Tranſcribers have written <hi>Babanus</hi> inſtead of <note place="margin">

                        </p>
                        <p>SECONDLY, It is certain that in reſpect of the Book it ſelf, there are none of the Authors of the 9th. Century to whom we can attribute this Book but to <hi>Ratram.</hi> This Book ſuppoſes in its Preface that there hapned a terrible diviſion between the Subjects of <hi>Charles the Bald</hi> touching the Euchariſt; and that this Prince according to his Piety, ſearching the means to reduce to the purity of the Faith thoſe that had changed it, engaged the Author of the Book of <hi>our Lords Body and Blood</hi> to tell him his thoughts on this ſubject. Now this time is exactly that wherein <hi>Ratram</hi> lived; and the eſteem which <hi>Charles the Bald</hi> ſhews this Author, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely the ſame which he paid to <hi>Ratram,</hi> in an occaſion like this. For his Subjects being divided on the matter of Grace and Predeſtination, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted <hi>Ratramnus</hi> on this difference, and ſhewed how greatly he valued his judgment in Theological Queſtions.</p>
                        <p>ALL theſe reaſons taken together do ſo well prove that the Book of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord</hi> is of <hi>Ratramnus,</hi> that thoſe who have not conſider'd 'em all, have yet yielded to the evidence of thoſe they were acquainted with. We may moreover ſay, that if they have not been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd, they have been at leaſt acknowledg'd before <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> by the Divines of <hi>Doway,</hi> whether they have ſeen Manuſcripts of the Book of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord,</hi> which bore the name of <hi>Ratram,</hi> as 'tis likely they did, or believ'd with <hi>Raynaud,</hi> that this corruption of the name of <hi>Bertram</hi> did not hinder but that <hi>Ratram</hi> muſt be acknowledg'd to be the Author of it. In effect, whence could they divine theſe three things, Firſt, That <hi>Bertram</hi> was a Monk of <hi>Corby</hi> as well as a Prieſt, <hi>Trithemius</hi> and <hi>Sigebert</hi> having never ſaid ſo, and the Title of the Book bearing <hi>Presbyteri,</hi> and not <hi>Monachi.</hi> Secondly, That this Book was not dedicated to <hi>Charlemain,</hi> but to <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> altho the Edition runs <hi>Ad Carolum magnum.</hi> Thirdly,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:41961:341"/> That the Author was a Catholick. Is not this a fair acknowledgment that <hi>Bertram</hi> is no other than <hi>Ratram</hi> an Author in whom theſe three things meet; if we compare the Title of the Book with what Authors ſay, that have ſpoken of this Religious. This is the judgment of the Divines of <hi>Doway,</hi> whom <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> has only followed.</p>
                        <p>AFTER the Divines of <hi>Doway</hi> and Biſhop <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> who diſcovered this truth more diſtinctly, Mr. <hi>De Marca</hi> was one of the firſt who lent his hand to it, as appears from his Treatiſe in French of the Euchariſt wrote before the year 1640. and publiſh'd by Monſieur the Abbot <hi>Faget</hi> his Couſin. <hi>Theophilus Raynaud</hi> the Jeſuit has ſince likewiſe follow'd the ſame ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">

                           <hi>Herman</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mauguin,</hi> altho he elſewhere oppoſes the later in ſeveral things. <hi>De Luc d' Achery</hi> and Mr. <hi>De S.

                        <p>'TIS true that ſince the late conjecture of Mr. <hi>De Marca</hi> became pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, to wit that <hi>John Scot</hi> is the Author of the Work <hi>of our Lords Body and Blood,</hi> and not <hi>Ratram, De Luc</hi> ſeems to yield to this novelty, and has <note place="margin">

For in this Book he takes indifferently <hi>Bertram</hi> and <hi>Ratram</hi> for one and the ſame Author.

                           <hi>Ratram,</hi> and <hi>Cellot</hi>'s anonymous Author ſaying that <hi>Ratram</hi> wrote a Book <hi>of the Body and Blood of our Lord;</hi> the Book of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord,</hi> known under the name of <hi>Bertram,</hi> is then <hi>Ratram</hi>'s: to this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I ſay, our Author anſwers, that altho <hi>Cellot</hi> cauſed the name of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramnus</hi> to be Printed in the two places of his Anonymous, wherein are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his Adverſaries; yet 'tis not thus found in two Manuſcripts of the Abby of S. <hi>Victor:</hi> but in the firſt there's <hi>Intramus,</hi> and in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Ratramnus, Cellot</hi> having cauſed the name of <hi>Ratramnus</hi> to be Printed contrary to what the Manuſcripts bear.</p>
                        <p>BUT this anſwer is not ſufficient. Firſt, <hi>Cellot</hi> has cauſed his Anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to be Printed from Father <hi>Sirmond</hi>'s Copy, who had taken it from a
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:41961:342"/> Manuſcript of <hi>Corby,</hi> and not from the Manuſcripts of the Abby of S. <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.</hi> Secondly, Theſe two Manuſcripts which are apparently falſe, are not ſo conſiderable as the Manuſcripts of the Anonymous, mention'd by <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> and others, which have all of 'em the name of <hi>Ratramnus,</hi> nor as the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript <note place="margin">
                              <hi>De Succeſſ. Eccleſ. p. 39. c. 2.

The <hi>Intram</hi> of the Manuſcripts of the Abby of S. <hi>Victor,</hi> is the Tranſcribers fault, who has disfigured the name of <hi>Ratram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> juſt as his <hi>Babanus</hi> is the famous <hi>Raban.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>TO another reaſon drawn from <hi>Sigebert,</hi> who makes the Author of the <note place="margin">De Succeſſ. Eccl. c. 2.</note> Book of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> to wit <hi>Ratramnus,</hi> the Author of the Book of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord,</hi> and of whom in effect two Manuſcripts repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the name of <hi>Ratramus,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Bertramus:</hi> to this reaſon, I ſay, the Author anſwers, Firſt, That the work of <hi>Bertram</hi> of <hi>Predeſtination</hi> is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that of <hi>Ratramnus,</hi> becauſe that according to <hi>Trithemius</hi> the work of <hi>Bertram</hi> contain'd only one Book, and was not dedicated to <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> whereas that of <hi>Ratram</hi> is dedicated to him, and contains two Books. Secondly, That all the Editions of <hi>Sigebert</hi> having conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the name of <hi>Bertram,</hi> we may believe that a fault has ſlipt into the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts of <hi>Gemblou,</hi> and of <hi>Vauvert,</hi> where we have the name of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramnus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT theſe two Anſwers are not ſatisfactory: As to the firſt, <hi>Trithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi> as well as <hi>Sigebert,</hi> ſays poſitively in two places that the Book of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram</hi> of <hi>Predeſtination</hi> is dedicated to <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> and brings ſuch reaſons for the proof of what he ſays, that there's no way to avoid the force of his teſtimony. Secondly, Either our Author ſuppoſes that <hi>Trithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi> ſaw a Treatiſe of <hi>Predeſtination</hi> under the name of <hi>Bertram</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd only one Book, or he will have him not to have ſeen it, as he believes that <hi>Trithemius</hi> has not ſeen the Book of our Lords Body and Blood. If <hi>Trithemius</hi> has ſeen this Treatiſe of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> what is become of it ſince <hi>Trithemius</hi> his time? How comes it to paſs no body ever heard of it, but this our Author? If <hi>Trithemius</hi> never ſaw it, why will our Author give credit to his teſtimony, when the queſtion concerns this Book of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination,</hi> and yet will not have us believe what he ſays of the Book of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord.</hi> Thirdly, Our Author abuſes the paſſage of <hi>Trithemius, Trithemius</hi> has follow'd <hi>Sigebert,</hi> and by <hi>librum</hi> ſeems to underſtand <hi>opus</hi> a work, without having reſpect to the number of the parts of which it is compoſed; unleſs we will ſuppoſe that one number has eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Printer, and that inſtead of theſe words <hi>de Predeſtinatione</hi> j. we ſhould read <hi>de Predeſtinatione</hi> jj. which is very poſſible, and of which there are an hundred examples in the Catalogue of <hi>Trithemius</hi> now in queſtion.</p>
                        <p>OUR Author's ſecond Anſwer is ſomething worſe than the firſt. I know but two Editions of <hi>Sigebert,</hi> that of <hi>Suffridus Petrus,</hi> and that of <hi>Miroeus,</hi> which in my opinion has been publiſh'd from that of <hi>Suffridus,</hi> Now as far as one can judg of 'em, the Manuſcripts of <hi>Gem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blou</hi> and <hi>Vauvert</hi> ought to be preferred to theſe Editions, becauſe the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript of <hi>Gemblou</hi> perhaps is the original of <hi>Sigebert</hi>'s own hand, who wrote and died at <hi>Gemblou.</hi> We know very well how great a difference there is between the Edition of the Chronicle of <hi>Sigebert</hi> by <hi>Miroeus</hi> from a
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:41961:342"/> Manuſcript of <hi>Gemblou,</hi> and the other Editions publiſh'd from Manuſcripts <note place="margin">See <hi>Labb. de Script. Eccleſ. in Sigiber.</hi>
                           </note> which have been corrupted. But ſuppoſing this were not <hi>Sigebert</hi>'s own Hand-writing, 'tis certain the Monks of an Abby know beſt the hands of Tranſcribers who have preceded them in the ſame place. It is likely then that this Manuſcript was more correct than thoſe to be met with elſewhere. This Manuſcript of <hi>Gemblou</hi> is moreover confirm'd by the Manuſcript of the Priory of <hi>Vauvert,</hi> and in fine by the Manuſcripts of the Book of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord,</hi> which bear the name of <hi>Ratramnus,</hi> as I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented.</p>
                        <p>OUR Author acquits himſelf not much better in another Argument which one may draw from this, that in the Book of <hi>the Birth of Chriſt, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramnus</hi> defends the ſame Doctrin which is taught in the Book of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord.</hi> He tells us that Biſhop <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> is he that has made this judgment on the Book of <hi>the Birth of Chriſt;</hi> but that this Treatiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at preſent publick, this conjecture of <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> can only ſerve to diſcover the inſincerity of this Proteſtant, becauſe there's not to be found one word of the myſtery of the Euchariſt in the Book of <hi>the Birth of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He adds hereunto other things, which do not belong to our ſubject, and which I do not refute as I might, leſt I turn aſide the Readers mind from the point in hand.</p>
                        <p>BUT he is to blame in accuſing Biſhop <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> of deceit. For what he ſays of this Book <hi>de Nativitate Chriſti,</hi> is comprehended in a Parenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, and there is neither affectation nor heat in producing it. It appears that this is a new diſcovery which he made ſince he wrote his Treatiſe of the <hi>Succeſſion and State of the Chriſtian Churches,</hi> wherein this remark had been proper. When he made this obſervation on the Book of <hi>the Birth of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> he handled a quite different ſubject, to wit, the Hiſtory of <hi>Gottheſcalc.</hi> The Manuſcripts which he cites, were not in his hands alone, neither did he ſuppreſs them: he carefully denotes the places where they were, and they may be eaſily found out. <hi>After all,</hi> ſays he, <hi>we are ſo far from reading the Doctrin of</hi> Bertram <hi>in the Book of</hi> the Birth of Chriſt, <hi>that we find not one word of the myſtery of the Euchariſt therein.</hi> Suppoſing this be true? muſt therefore Biſhop <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> be an Impoſtor unworthy of credit? That Prelate only ſays that the ſame Doctrin is to be found in the Book of <hi>the Birth of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which is in that of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord.</hi> He does not make a particular mention of the Euchariſt. But if he meant ſo, we need only caſt our eyes on ſome places of this Book of <hi>the Birth of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to approve of his judgment. We know that the Book of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord,</hi> combating the ſubſtantial Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in the Euchariſt, rejects likewiſe as an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, the opinion which aſſerts that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt may be in ſeveral places, and the Book of <hi>the Birth of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> diſtinctly aſſerts that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, is ſo determin'd by its nature to be in one <note place="margin">Tom. 1. <hi>Spicil.</hi> p. 323, 324. c. 3.</note> place, that 'tis impoſſible for it to be in two places at once; altho our Lord is every where in reſpect of his Divinity. And thus does it combat the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſequences of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his opinion, which certainly ſuffices to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> if he reſpected this matter.</p>
                        <p>AS to the reaſon which we draw from the conformity which there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Book of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord,</hi> and the works of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram,</hi> the Author anſwers that this conjecture might have ſome force were
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:41961:343"/> the queſtion, whether the Book of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord</hi> was written by <hi>Ratram,</hi> or <hi>Oecolampadius;</hi> but at preſent when 'tis doubted whether it be the work of <hi>Ratram,</hi> or of ſome other Author of the ſame Century, it is uſeleſs, moſt Authors of the 9th. Century finiſhing or beginning their Books, with acknowledgments of their own weakneſs and inabilities, like to thoſe which are to be met with in the undoubted Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Ratram,</hi> and in that of <hi>Bertram,</hi> for which he alledges ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples taken out of two Treatiſes of <hi>John Scot.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT he pitifully eludes this reaſon. It is taken from the whole ſtyle and genius of the Book of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord,</hi> compared with the ſtyle and genius of the works of <hi>Ratram,</hi> and not from ſome ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which ſeem conformable therein. <hi>Cellot</hi> and Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> were of this opinion. And certainly th'Inſcriptions of the Books are alike; the Book of <hi>Predeſtination</hi> is <hi>adſcribed Domino glorioſo proecellentiſſimo principi Carolo,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">T. 1. <hi>Mauguin,</hi> p. 29. <hi>Microp.</hi> p. 512. T. 1. <hi>Maug.</hi> p. 109.</note> 
                           <hi>Ratramnus,</hi> and that of the <hi>Body and Blood of our Lord</hi> begins <hi>Glorioſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cips;</hi> whereas <hi>John Scot</hi> calls <hi>Charles Seniorem.</hi> He is treated with the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Magnificent in <hi>Ratram</hi>'s Book of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> and in that of the <hi>Body and Blood of our Lord</hi> in like manner. <hi>Ratram</hi> being engag'd by the Kings Command to write of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> ſhews great modeſty in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which alſo appears in the Book of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram</hi> commends the King's Piety for his enquiries into Religion, and ſubmits to his Cenſures. All which is ſeen in the Book of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord. Ratram</hi> follows the holy Fathers with ſuch zeal, that in the firſt Book of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> he brings into every line almoſt the ſayings of S. <hi>Auguſtin, Proſper, Salvien, Gregory,</hi> upon which he makes reflections. And thus does he likewiſe in the ſecond, wherein he only cites Orthodox Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; and the ſame method he uſes in the ſecond part of the Book <hi>of the Body and Blood.</hi> There can be nothing more regular than the method of <note place="margin">T. 1. <hi>Maug.</hi> p. 30.</note> 
                           <hi>Ratram</hi> in his Books of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> he deſcends to the foundation, and divides his whole ſubject into two queſtions: we find the ſame regularity <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Microp</hi> p. 513, 514. T. 1. <hi>Maug.</hi> p 61. T. 1. <hi>Maug.</hi> p. 13.</note> in the Book of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord:</hi> the recapitulations are in a manner the ſame. We ſee therein the ſame modeſty in not naming thoſe againſt whom he wrote, in conſerving the glorious quality of the Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of <hi>Charles the Bald:</hi> we meet with the ſame thing in the Book of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>WE might confirm the ſame truth by comparing the Treatiſe of <hi>the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood of our Lord</hi> with the other works of <hi>Ratram,</hi> were that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble any way neceſſary. But I believe this is ſufficient to perſuade thoſe who weigh things.</p>
                        <p>IT is certain that our Author produces a reaſon to ſhew that <hi>Ratram</hi> is not the Author of the Book of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord.</hi> He draws it from the ſilence of <hi>Hincmar. This ſilence,</hi> ſays he, <hi>diſcovers ſo evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly th' injuſtice which has been done to</hi> Ratram <hi>in attributing the Book of</hi> Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram <hi>to him, that ſuppoſing we had no other proofs to juſtifie him, this here will be more than ſufficient to take away all ſuſpicions which within theſe few years have been entertain'd touching his integrity in the Faith.</hi> There is no likelihood, if we believe our Author, that <hi>Hincmar,</hi> who on one hand was animated againſt <hi>Ratram,</hi> and wrote againſt him a great Book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> and this expreſſion <hi>Trina Deitas;</hi> and who on the other condemned as an error and novelty contrary to the Faith the Opinion
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:41961:343"/> of <hi>John Scot,</hi> who ſaid, that the Euchariſt was not our Lords true Body, but only its figure and memorial, would not have reproached <hi>Ratram</hi> on this ſubject, had he believed him the Author of this Book which goes under the name of <hi>Bertram,</hi> ſeeing this Book yielded occaſion enough to a paſſionate enemy, as <hi>Hincmar</hi> was, to charge him with this Hereſie.</p>
                        <p>BUT this reflection is but a ſilly one. Firſt, from one word which <hi>Hincmar</hi> has uttered againſt <hi>John Scot</hi> in favour of <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> we muſt not conclude that <hi>Hincmar</hi> was at full liberty to write againſt <hi>Ratramnus,</hi> and t'encounter him as an Heretick. Secondly, I do not ſee why <hi>Hincmar</hi> ſhould be ſo mightily tranſported againſt <hi>Ratram,</hi> who ſpake without heat, and mentioned not any of thoſe againſt whom he wrote. If <hi>Hincmar</hi> was tranſported againſt <hi>Ratram</hi> on another ſubject, it does not hence follow he muſt be always in the like paſſion on all ſubjects which he had to debate with this Religious. Thirdly, This our Author ſuppoſes without reaſon that <hi>Hincmar</hi> was in a condition to inſult over <hi>Ratram</hi> on the queſtion of the Euchariſt, as he did in that of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> and there is herein a great deal of difference. When <hi>Hincmar</hi> was ſo greatly tranſported againſt <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram,</hi> 'twas becauſe he had the Council of <hi>Creſſy</hi> on his ſide, 'twas becauſe <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Maug. Diſſert. Hiſt.</hi> p. 141.</note> 
                           <hi>John Scot</hi> declared himſelf for him againſt <hi>Gotheſcalc</hi> and <hi>Ratram;</hi> 'twas becauſe the famous <hi>Raban</hi> had prejudicated in his favour in a Council held at <hi>Mayence</hi> in 848. but there was nothing like this in the queſtion of the Euchariſt. <hi>John Scot</hi> had declared himſelf againſt the ſentiments of <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſus;</hi> the King knew it, and kept him in his Palace, which was a ſufficient prejudice againſt <hi>Hincmar.</hi> The famous <hi>Raban</hi> conſulted by <hi>Heribold</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Auxerre</hi> and Arch-Chaplain, that is to ſay, great Almoner, had clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken part againſt the ſentiments of the ſame <hi>Paſchaſus;</hi> and the learned Church of <hi>Lyons</hi> who had perſecuted <hi>John Scot,</hi> whilſt he defended the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of <hi>Hincmar</hi> touching Predeſtination, ceaſed moleſting him when he combated the ſentiments of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> on the Doctrin of the Euchariſt. Fourthly, Our Author ſuppoſes with the ſame raſhneſs that <hi>Hincmar</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved this Controverſie to be as important as it is at this day, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all probability. For, Firſt, <hi>Hincmar</hi> contents himſelf with criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing on the opinion of <hi>John Scot</hi> in very ſoft terms, he does not call it <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,</hi> but <hi>novelty of words,</hi> whereas <hi>Raban</hi> and <hi>Hincmar</hi> term'd the opinion of <hi>Gottheſcalc</hi> on the Divine Grace, Hereſie, and Schiſm. Secondly, If we come to compare what <hi>Hincmar</hi> ſays againſt <hi>Ratram</hi> on the <hi>trina Deitas,</hi> ſhall we not find that what he ſays againſt <hi>John Scot</hi> contains nothing ſo outragious? <hi>Hincmar</hi> was a friend of <hi>Raban</hi>'s who wrote a Letter to <hi>Egilon</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">

                           <note place="margin">T. 1. <hi>Maug.</hi> p. 21.</note> with a great deal of reſpect, even after his death, altho <hi>Heribold</hi> was ſo far from being of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> his opinion, that in the later ages, the name of Heriboldiens was given to the Diſciples of <hi>Berenger,</hi> as we find in the Writings of <hi>Tho. Waldenſis.</hi> Fifthly, If this ſilence of <hi>Hincmar</hi> proves <note place="margin">T. 2. <hi>de Sacra. c.</hi> 61.</note> that <hi>Ratram</hi> did not write the Book of the <hi>Body and Blood of our Lord,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Hincmar</hi> would have reproached him with it, what judgment muſt we make of this Authors affirming that <hi>John Scot</hi> wrote this Book of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram</hi>'s, altho the Church of <hi>Lyons</hi> which wrote ſo fiercely againſt him, has not reproached him with it? Why did not alſo <hi>Prudentius</hi> do it in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe againſt <hi>Hincmar</hi> and <hi>Pardulus?</hi> Was not this the ready way to decry theſe two Biſhops, to reproach them that they made uſe of the Pen of a
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:41961:344"/> profeſt enemy to the Real Preſence and Tranſubſtantiation? Why did <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> the firſt ſuffer this Hereſie growing in the boſom of <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> without warning this Prince of it? That ſame <hi>Nicholas</hi> who concerned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo much in the affairs on this ſide the Mountains, and uſed all means to inform himſelf of 'em? <hi>Nicholas</hi> the firſt ſhall beſtir himſelf in the affair of <hi>Rothadus</hi> of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> in that of <hi>Hincmar</hi> of <hi>Laon,</hi> where the point was only about Diſcipline, and remain unconcerned in the buſineſs of <hi>John Scot,</hi> altho he erred in the Euchariſt. He ſhall take notice of the affairs of <hi>Ebbon</hi> of <hi>Reims,</hi> and thoſe whom he had ordain'd, and not take any notice of a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion agitated at the Court of <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> in which this Prince did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt himſelf? He ſhall know that <hi>Raban</hi> had oppoſed the Real Preſence by publick Writings, that he to whom <hi>Raban</hi> wrote was become Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Sens,</hi> that an Arch-Chaplain had erred in this matter, and all this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being concerned? The fault which our Author commits in this refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction on the ſilence of <hi>Hincmar,</hi> proceeds from his not minding two things; the one is that, we muſt not always ground our ſelves on peoples propoſing their ſentiments in advantageous terms, and ſpeaking the opinion of their adverſaries with diſdain and contempt. This is particularly the ſtile of <hi>Hincmar</hi> in every malter he treats of, as it has been already obſerv'd by Mr. <hi>Mauguin</hi> and Mr. <hi>De la Motte,</hi> which cannot be unknown to our Author, <note place="margin">

                        <p>THE other is, that our Author has conceiv'd that the cenſure of <hi>Hinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> againſt <hi>John Scot</hi> imports that <hi>Hincmar</hi> believ'd the Real Preſence with its conſequences, as the Adoration, the Sacrifice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which has made him judg that <hi>Hincmar</hi> muſt reſpect the opinion of <hi>John Scot</hi> as a deteſtable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie.

                              <hi>A Refutation of what the Author of the</hi> Diſſertation <hi>offers to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade that the Book of</hi> the Body and Blood of our Lord, <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd under the Name of</hi> Bertram <hi>is of</hi> John Scot.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>HAVING hitherto firmly enough eſtabliſh'd that the Book of <hi>our Lords Body and Blood</hi> is of <hi>Ratram,</hi> I might paſs by whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi> alledges to fortifie the Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Mr. <hi>De Marca;</hi> and truly ſeeing that before Mr. <hi>De Marca,</hi> no man of learning, nor any of <hi>Berenger</hi>'s enemies, either in the 11th. Century, or in the following, made this diſcovery; ſeeing that the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity of the Faith</hi> entertain'd at firſt the opinion of Mr. <hi>De Marca</hi> with miſtruſt, that he might handſomly leave it, if he were forced: It thereupon ſeems I have right to deſpiſe whatſoever our Author alledges to make the world believe that the Book of <hi>Bertram</hi> is the Book of <hi>John Scot</hi> under a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Title. Nevertheleſs I will ſhew that the proofs which he offers have no ſolidity.</p>
                        <pb n="293" facs="tcp:41961:344"/>
                        <p>THESE proofs are, 1. That the Book of <hi>Bertram</hi> is entirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable <note place="margin">Art. 3. of the <hi>Diſſert.</hi> on <hi>John Scot.</hi>
                           </note> to what we read in ancient Writers concerning that of <hi>John Scot.</hi> 2. That the proper character of <hi>John Scot</hi> is therein to be met with. But at bottom he eſtabliſhes neither one nor the other.</p>
                        <p>AS to the firſt, our Author relates a paſſage of <hi>Aſcelin</hi> in a Letter to <note place="margin">Ibid. ſect. 1.</note> 
                           <hi>Berenger,</hi> whence he believes one may gather, that the work of <hi>John Scot</hi> contain'd only one Book, and that ſmall enough: that a man cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently perceive in <hi>John Scots</hi> Book what was his opinion on the myſtery of the Euchariſt; that maugre the diſſimulations of <hi>John Scot,</hi> yet <hi>Aſcelin</hi> found therein his whole deſign was to perſuade the Readers that what is Conſecrated on the Altars is not truly the Body and Blood of our Lord; that to compaſs his drift <hi>John Scot</hi> made uſe of ſeveral paſſages of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and at the end of each paſſage added ſome gloſs to bring the ſenſe of 'em to his purpoſe; that amongſt others, <hi>John Scot</hi> recited at length an Oriſon of S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> which begins with theſe words, <hi>Perficiant in nobis,</hi> and having trifled with ſome places of S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> and S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> whom he principally made uſe of, as <hi>Berenger</hi> inſinuates, he forms his concluſion in theſe terms, <hi>Specie geruntur iſta non veritate.</hi> And theſe are the things which as our Author thinks agree with <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Book.</p>
                        <p>BUT theſe reflections which our Author pretends one may alſo make on the Book of <hi>Bertram,</hi> are either uneflectual for his deſign, or want a foundation. 1. Nothing hinders that two works touching the Euchariſt may have been ſhort enough to be equally treated as ſmall Books. 2. I have ſhew'd that our Author is miſtaken. when he calls <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Book an obſcure and intricate piece. Even <hi>Aſcelin</hi> does not ſcruple to treat <hi>John Scot</hi> as an Heretick by reaſon of his ſentiment on the Euchariſt; and our Author has not well enough comprehended the Text of <hi>Aſcelin.</hi> 3. Two Authors who hold the ſame opinion ſhould likewiſe aim at the ſame mark. They muſt if they are endued with common ſenſe, from the ſame reflections in ſubſtance on the paſſages of the Fathers which they would have to ſerve their deſigns. Theſe two Characters then are too general and wide. And for the two laſt conſiderations, 1. Who doubts that two Authors, one of whom has apparently read the Book of the other, as <hi>Ratram</hi> may have read that of <hi>John Scot,</hi> may not cite the ſame authorities? <hi>Ratram</hi> and <hi>Raban</hi> have done it, as we are inform'd by the Anonymous of <hi>Cellot.</hi> 2. 'Tis not true <hi>Berenger</hi> has inſinuated that <hi>John Scot</hi> cited principally S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> and S. <hi>Auſtin. Berenger</hi> ſays <hi>John Scot</hi> cannot be reſpected as an Heretick, without throwing this ignominy on theſe Fathers and ſeveral others. But he does not ſay that <hi>John Scot</hi> cited particularly theſe three holy Doctors, and ſhould he have ſaid it, this character would be too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, there having been ſcarcely any of the Authors of the 9th. Century, who have not affected to follow chiefly theſe three Doctors. 3. Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ought not to propoſe as a character of identity, that <hi>Bertram</hi> has drawn the ſame concluſion from the Oriſon <hi>Perficiant in nobis,</hi> as <hi>John Scot</hi> has done: for to ſpeak properly, this concluſion, <hi>Specie geruntur iſta non ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate,</hi> is not of <hi>Bertram,</hi> nor of <hi>John Scot,</hi> but the Text it ſelf of the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which bears, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t quoe nunc ſpecie gerimus, veritate capiamus:</hi> now it is apparent that they were equally obliged to conſerve theſe terms in their concluſion, and that they could neither of 'em do it, in a more natural man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than in forming it thus, <hi>Specie gerunter iſta non veritate.</hi> We muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:41961:345"/> obſerve, and that as <hi>Aſcelin</hi> relates, that <hi>John Scot</hi> cited this Oriſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> whereas <hi>Bertram</hi> cites it as the common Service of the Church, and that how great ſoever the conformity has been between the concluſion of theſe Authors in reſpect of the ſenſe and words, it is not ſo great in reſpect of the conſtruction of 'em. <hi>Bertram</hi> having theſe words, <hi>In ſpecie geruntur iſta non in veritate,</hi> and <hi>John Scot</hi> theſe, <hi>Specie geruntur iſta non in veritate,</hi> which proves that theſe are two different Authors.</p>
                        <p>THE ſecond witneſs which our Author produces is <hi>Berenger,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us that the Book of <hi>John Scot</hi> was wrote at the intreaty of a King of <hi>France,</hi> and that this King was <hi>Charlemain.</hi> Our Author pretends that theſe two particulars are to be met with in the Book of <hi>Bertram,</hi> which is dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to <hi>Charlemain,</hi> and was written by his order.</p>
                        <p>BUT theſe conformities conclude nothing; not the firſt, becauſe 'twas very poſſible that <hi>Charles the Bald</hi> had at the ſame time obliged two learned men to write on the ſame ſubject; one who dwelt in his Palace, to wit, <hi>John Scot,</hi> and the other whoſe name was ſo illuſtrious in his Kingdom, that he had already oblig'd him to write on the queſtions of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> to wit, <hi>Ratramnus.</hi> This Character is too general. Not the ſecond, for it does not ſeem that the Book of <hi>our Lords Body and Blood,</hi> nor that of <hi>John Scot</hi> of the Euchariſt, were inſcribed, <hi>Ad Carolum magnum Imperatorem,</hi> but only, <hi>Ad Carolum Regem,</hi> which is what one may recollect from <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gebert,</hi> from the Abbot <hi>Trithemius,</hi> from <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and the <note place="margin">De Script.

                           <note place="margin">

                           </note> what ought to be referred to <hi>Charles the Bald.</hi> At leaſt 'tis by a miſtake of this nature that <hi>Sigebert</hi> has placed <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſuard</hi> and <hi>Hincmar</hi> under the Reign of <hi>Charlemain;</hi> wherein <hi>Sigebert</hi> has been follow'd by <hi>Trithemius,</hi> altho both one and the other have written under <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> as all the world acknowledges in reſpect of <hi>Hincmar,</hi> and as <hi>Bollandus</hi> and <hi>Labbeus</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg in reſpect of <hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>BUT ſuppoſing that the Book of <hi>John Scot</hi> was inſcrib'd <hi>Ad Carolum Magnum Imperatorem,</hi> as is at this day that of <hi>Bertram</hi> in the Impreſſions, how will it hence follow that theſe two Books are but one and the ſame? <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſays our Author, <hi>if we ſuppoſe that this Title is equally falſe, 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficult for chance to produce the ſame falſity in two different Books, which in other reſpects had ſo great reſemblance. And if it be pretended that the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is true, it will be moreover very ſtrange for the fancy of two different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to meet in giving it this Title.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THIS difficulty is a ſmall one, we do not ſay that <hi>Ratram</hi> and <hi>John Scot</hi> have given the Title of <hi>Charlemain</hi> to <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> but affirm it not to be ſo ſtrange a thing, that <hi>Berenger</hi> having attributed to <hi>Charlemain</hi> what ought to be apply'd to <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> thoſe that came after ſhould refer to <hi>Charlemain</hi> a like Title, this Prince paſſing for a lover of Theological learning, as having been the reſtorer of it: The examples which I alledged
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:41961:345"/> prove the thing poſſible, ſeeing they prove it to have hapned. <hi>Berenger</hi> then is no more favourable to our Author than <hi>Aſcelin</hi> was.</p>
                        <p>AS to <hi>Durand</hi> of <hi>Troarn,</hi> I ſee moreover leſs reaſon why our Author <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Lib. de Corp. &amp; Sang. Dom.</hi> part 9.</note> ſhould produce what <hi>Durand</hi> has ſaid of the Council of <hi>Paris,</hi> wherein the Book of <hi>John Scot</hi> was condemned, <hi>Damnatis Berengarii complicibus cum codice Joannis Scoti ex quo ea quoe damnabantur ſumpta videbantur, concilio ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luto diſceſſum eſt:</hi> For if it be true, as our Author will have it, that by this way of ſpeaking <hi>Durand</hi> has inſinuated that altho in the Council of <hi>Paris John Scot</hi>'s Book was condemned, yet was it not ſo evident a matter, that the Book of <hi>John Scot</hi> contains the ſentiments of <hi>Berenger,</hi> which, as our Author believes, agrees likewiſe with the Book of <hi>Bertram,</hi> which he treats as obſcure and perplexed, there can be nothing thence concluded but what will be to the diſadvantage of this Council, wherein was condemned for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, what only ought to be eſteemed obſcure.</p>
                        <p>BUT ſeeing our Author deſign'd to ſpeak of the pretended obſcurity of <hi>John Scot</hi>'s Writings, methinks he ought not to joyn to the place of <hi>Durand</hi> that of <hi>Lanfranc,</hi> who reproaches <hi>Berenger,</hi> that as ſoon as the Council aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled at <hi>Rome</hi> knew that by his highly praiſing the Book of <hi>John Scot,</hi> and blaming that of <hi>Paſchaſus, Berenger</hi> had deviated from the Faith of the Church, he was thrown out from the Communion of the Faithful; for 'tis not credible, the Council would have been ſo ſevere againſt the perplext ſtyle of <hi>John Scot,</hi> even to the condemning his Book to the flames, had not his Book been apparently written againſt <hi>Paſchaſus.</hi> And truly how could this be at firſt ſo underſtood both at <hi>Paris,</hi> at <hi>Verceil,</hi> and at <hi>Rome</hi> as that in the ſenſe of theſe Councils, to praiſe <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> was properly to condemn <hi>John Scot?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>OUR Author pretends in the laſt place, that ſeeing <hi>Lanfranc, Berenger,</hi> and <hi>Aſcelin,</hi> and the reſt of the Writers of the 11th. Century, mention on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>John Scot</hi> when they ſpeak of the adverſaries of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, one muſt conclude that from the time of <hi>Lanfranc</hi> and <hi>Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> there was no other Book known which appeared contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> but that of <hi>John Scot.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT the ſilence of theſe Authors is no more favourable to him than their teſtimonies. In effect, ſuppoſing that in the 11th. Century there did not appear any other Book againſt <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> but <hi>John Scot</hi>'s, which cannot be affirm'd without raſhneſs and injuſtice, conſidering the care which has been taken to conceal from us whatſoever might inform us in this point; it does not follow <hi>John Scot</hi>'s Book and <hi>Bertram</hi>'s be one and the ſame. By this reaſon muſt the Epiſtle of <hi>Raban</hi> to <hi>Egilon,</hi> and his anſwer to <hi>Heribold</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Auxerre,</hi> wherein he has oppoſed the ſentiments of <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> be the Book of <hi>John Scot.</hi> For there was no mention of theſe Writings of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> in the time of <hi>Berenger, Lanfranc</hi> and <hi>Aſcelin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>MOREOVER, our Author himſelf refutes his own opinion when he urges the ſilence of theſe Authors; for it appears by the teſtimony of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franc, Berenger,</hi> and <hi>Aſcelin,</hi> that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> and <hi>John Scot</hi> were regarded as the two principal men in this Diſpute: it is then very likely that the Book of <hi>John Scot</hi> was directly written againſt <hi>Paſchaſus: Paſchaſus</hi> was therein ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther named, or at leaſt apparently meant, which is not ſo in the Writings
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:41961:346"/> of <hi>Bertram,</hi> who handles matters in a leſs polemical manner, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver names <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> nor ſeems to give the leaſt hint of him, which has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently tended to its preſervation. And this is what I had to remark on the firſt proof of our Author.</p>
                        <p>TO eſtabliſh the ſecond, to wit, that the proper character of the ſtyle of <hi>Bertram</hi> is the ſame as that of <hi>John Scot,</hi> our Author pretends that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <note place="margin">Article 3. of the <hi>Diſſert.</hi> on <hi>John Scot.</hi>
                           </note> judgments of knowing perſons of the Roman Communion and of our own, touching the Doctrin of <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Book, are teſtimonies evident enough of the proper character of his genius, that is to ſay, of a genius naturally confuſed and perplex'd, or diſſimulative, which fears to diſcover clearly its thoughts on the ſubject which it treats of, and affects to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict it ſelf the more dexterouſly to inſinuate its own ſentiment, and avoid cenſures. He aſſures us afterwards that this character appears with greater clearneſs in <hi>John Scot</hi>'s Dialogue of Natures, and in his Book of Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; whence he concludes that we muſt not doubt but the Book of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram</hi> is <hi>John Scot</hi>'s. It is in the ſame reſpect after our Author had alledged ſome inſtances of the contradictions of <hi>John Scot,</hi> and judged uncharitably that they proceeded not from a perplex'd and confuſed head, ſeeing that when he will he moſt clearly explains his notions without contradicting himſelf, but that theſe are only ſtratagems of a Philoſopher who was more a Pagan than a Chriſtian, he affirms the ſame may be found in <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Book, which ſeems in twenty places to deviate from the Doctrin of the Real Preſence, and which yet ſeems in as many places to approve of it, ſo that a man does not know where to have him.</p>
                        <p>BUT the two parts of our Authors remark contradict and oppoſe each other. For if <hi>John Scot</hi> had naturally a confuſed and perplexed mind, how comes it that he clearly explains his thoughts when he will, and keeps firm when he pleaſes without contradicting himſelf. This is not the character of a confuſed and perplexed head. Secondly, We ought not to believe that as ſoon as an Author falls into contradiction, which has ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Fathers themſelves, as every body knows, and eſpecially in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which have perplexed <hi>John Scot,</hi> and wherein he has contradicted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he then makes uſe of the ſtratagems of a Philoſopher that is more a Pagan than a Chriſtian. Thirdly, Our Author impertinently feigns that <hi>Bertram</hi> has affected obſcurity and ambiguous expreſſions. This <hi>Bertram,</hi> be he who he will, was certainly upheld by King <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> and <hi>Heribold</hi> the chief perſon of the Gallican Church was of his ſentiment as well as <hi>Raban,</hi> and what is more remarkable it appears that he defended the publick Doctrin of the Church. Fourthly, Our Author ſhould not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the judgment of the Centuriators of <hi>Magdebourg</hi> to ſhew this Book to be obſcure in the judgments of thoſe of our own party. If the Centuria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have ſuſpected ſome expreſſions of <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Book, we know that from 1537. <hi>Bulinger</hi> cited it with Elogies. Moreover, that ſome of the Doctors of the Roman Communion have mention'd <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Book, as if it made <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Commentar. in 1 ad</hi> Cor. 10. p. 190.</note> for them. This is purely th' effect of this prejudice which has made them produce the writings of <hi>Raban,</hi> as if <hi>Raban</hi> had been of their opinion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho 'twas well known in the 12th. Century that <hi>Raban</hi> wrote againſt <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſus.</hi> The Cenſurers who condemned <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Book, and who are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick perſons, are ſooner to be believed than private men.</p>
                        <pb n="297" facs="tcp:41961:346"/>
                        <p>OUR Author remarks again a ſecond character of the genius of <hi>John Scot,</hi> which he believes is in <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Book, to wit, theſe arguments put in form, this crowd of Syllogiſms and Enthymemes heapt up one upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; theſe Maxims, and theſe Principles drawn from the Philoſophy of <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> For as he ſhews by the teſtimony of S. <hi>Prudencius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Troy,</hi> and <hi>Florus,</hi> Deacon of the Church of <hi>Lyons,</hi> this is the way of <hi>John Scot</hi> in Diſputes, he pretends that all this form of reaſoning is to be met with in the Book of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord,</hi> of which he produces three inſtances.</p>
                        <p>BUT this other conformity is as ill grounded as the preceding ones. I confeſs that the way of <hi>John Scot</hi> is very argumentative. One may obſerve it in his Books of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> as <hi>Prudencius</hi> and <hi>Florus</hi> have reproach'd him. But I do not ſee that becauſe there are ſome Philoſophical Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in <hi>Bertram</hi>'s <hi>Book,</hi> (our Author produces but three, and thoſe alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the ſame Period) he muſt immediately draw this concluſion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Book of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord</hi> is <hi>John Scot</hi>'s. Nor yet had <hi>Bertram</hi> named any where <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> which <hi>John Scot</hi> failed not to do, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in ſeveral places of his Manuſcript Treatiſe <hi>of Natures.</hi> But <hi>Bertram</hi> has not ſo much as the name of this Philoſopher.</p>
                        <p>YET ſeeing our Author puts us upon conſidering the genius of theſe Authors, let us ſhew a little what is the genius of <hi>John Scot,</hi> and that of <hi>Bertram</hi>'s, whence it will clearly appear there's nothing ſo abſurd as to make <hi>John Scot</hi> Author of the Book of <hi>Bertram.</hi> Here are ſome of their Characters.</p>
                        <p>

                           <hi>BERTRAM</hi>'s Latin ſtyle is polite enough for the Age he wrote in, and I find but one Greek word in his whole Treatiſe, and which he alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges only becauſe 'tis found in a paſſage of S. <hi>Iſidor</hi> which he cited.

                           <hi>BERTRAM</hi> might have combated the opinion of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of Arguments taken from Philoſophy, which he does not do; whereas <hi>John Scot</hi> makes uſe every where of Philoſophical Arguments even <note place="margin">T. 1. <hi>Maug.</hi> p. 111, 112. 182.</note> to the mixing of 'em with matters which ſeem to claim an exemption from 'em.</p>
                        <p>THAT which diſtinguiſhes 'em yet more is, that <hi>Bertram</hi> delivers himſelf in a moſt plain manner on the verity of the human nature of our Saviour, ſince 'twas exalted up into glory by the Reſurrection.

                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>SEEING that the Book of <hi>our Lords Body and Blood</hi> is a piece of <hi>Ratram</hi>'s, and not of <hi>John Scot,</hi> we ſhall not be apt to ſuppoſe, as the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi> does, that <hi>Berenger</hi> or his Diſciples firſt publiſh'd this Writing under the name of <hi>Bertram.</hi> And truly it is a hard matter to know the commendations which <hi>Hildebert</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Mans,</hi> and ſince Arch Biſhop of <hi>Tours</hi> has given <hi>Berenger,</hi> and to fall into a ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion ſo injurious to the memory of this great man. <hi>Hildebert</hi> deſcribes <hi>Berenger</hi> as a perſon</p>
                        <lg>
                           <l>
                              <hi>Cujus cura ſequi naturam, legibus uti</hi>

                           <l>
                              <hi>Et mentem vitiis, ora negare dolis.</hi>

                           </l>
                        </lg>
                        <p>A man that follows theſe Maxims, and thoſe who are taught by him, are far enough from all manner of deceit. I need only then ſhew that ſuppoſing <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Book were <hi>John Scot</hi>'s, the effect would not ceaſe to be near up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame, becauſe <hi>John Scot</hi> has been a man of great note, and authority in the 9th. Century. But becauſe our Author imagins that the name of <hi>Bertram,</hi> under which this Book has firſt appeared, proves clearly that it is not <hi>Ratram</hi>'s, it is fitting before this to conſider his Obſervations,</p>
                        <p>THE firſt of which amounts to this, that <hi>Sigebert, Trithemius,</hi> and <note place="margin">Diſſert. Art. 3. ſect. 3.</note> 
                           <hi>Cellot</hi>'s Anonymous, which are the only Authors who have ſpoken of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram,</hi> attribute to him no other works, than thoſe of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord,</hi> and of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> of which, theſe two firſt Authors make no mention, in ſpeaking of <hi>John Scot,</hi> altho it be moſt certain that <hi>John Scot</hi> has written two Books on theſe ſame ſubjects; whence he concludes that <hi>Bertram</hi> is a fictitious Author, which at bottom is no other than <hi>John Scot.</hi> Thus does the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi> argue.</p>
                        <p>BUT there is nothing ſolid in this remark. Firſt, The Book of <hi>John Scot</hi> of <hi>Predeſtination</hi> is dedicated to <hi>Hincmar,</hi> and <hi>Pardulus;</hi> whereas <hi>Sigebert</hi> remarks expreſly that that of <hi>Bertram,</hi> or of <hi>Ratram,</hi> was dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> as we ſee in effect in the Impreſſion of this Book of <hi>Ratram,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Mauguin</hi> has publiſh'd. Secondly, <hi>Trithemius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms in two places the Text of <hi>Sigebert,</hi> altho in another place he ſays al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Book of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord</hi> was dedicated to <hi>Charles,</hi> which <hi>Sigebert</hi> was ſilent in. Thirdly, It is falſe that <hi>Cellot</hi>'s Anonymous had the name of <hi>Bertram,</hi> he has always <hi>Ratram</hi>'s in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript of <hi>Corbie;</hi> and in the two Manuſcripts of the Abby of S. <hi>Victor</hi> we find that in one place this Anonymous gives for adverſaries to <hi>Paſchaſus, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus</hi> and <hi>Intramus,</hi> and in the following page <hi>Babanus</hi> and <hi>Ratramnus,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one nor in the other of theſe two places has the Tranſcriber the name of <hi>Bertram,</hi> which would be ſtrange if the Title which this Book has had ſince the 11th. Century were that of <hi>Bertram,</hi> and not that of <hi>Ratram,</hi> as we affirm. Fourthly, It is falſe that Authors ſpeak but of two
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:41961:348"/> pieces attributed to <hi>Bertram: Trithemius</hi> ſays in two places that <hi>Bertram</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">De Script. Eccl. <hi>fol. 57.</hi> &amp; in chron. Hirſaug.</note> wrote ſeveral other Books. Fifthly, The ſilence of the Anonymous is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently alledged touching the other works of <hi>Bertram,</hi> ſeeing he has not the name of <hi>Bertram,</hi> and ſhould he have had the name, his drift would not carry him to ſpeak of any other Writing of <hi>Bertram,</hi> but that of the Euchariſt. Sixthly, If <hi>Sigebert</hi> mention'd not the Book of the Euchariſt which <hi>John Scot</hi> wrote by the order of <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> there can be nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded hence unleſs it may be affirm'd by the ſame reaſon, that his other works, as that <hi>of Natures,</hi> have been attributed to other Authors. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly, There is nothing more natural than to ſay that <hi>Trithemius</hi> has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the Books of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> and of the Euchariſt of <hi>John Scot,</hi> when he ſays <hi>Joannes dictus Erigena ſcripſit quoedam alia.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE ſecond remark of this Author is, that thoſe who ſpeak of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Diſſert. ibid.</note> do not know him particularly, nor agree about his true name; that <hi>Sigebert</hi> who in ſome Manuſcript Copies calls him <hi>Ratram,</hi> does not denote the quality he had, which he is wont to do in ſpeaking of other Authors; that the Abbot <hi>Trithemius</hi> who ſpeaks of <hi>Bertram</hi> in three places, could not ſay in what Dioceſs, nor in what Monaſtery he made himſelf ſo famous, altho he always made theſe kind of remarks in ſpeaking of th' Illuſtrious men of the order of S. <hi>Bennet,</hi> ſo that there's reaſon to believe that he too lightly made the <hi>Elogium</hi> of <hi>Bertram,</hi> whoſe works were apparently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to him; in fine, that the Anonymous who deſigns the other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors by their qualities, as <hi>Raban, Heribold, Paſchaſus, Egilon</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Ratram</hi> as of an unknown perſon, <hi>Ratramnus quidam,</hi> denoting that he knew nothing of him, but that his name was <hi>Ratram,</hi> or <hi>Intram,</hi> as ſpeak the Manuſcripts of the Abby of S. <hi>Victor.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT our Author is miſtaken in his ſuppoſitions. Firſt, It is not true <hi>Sigebert</hi> gives conſtantly to the Writers, of which he ſpeaks, the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical qualifications they had, the contrary appears from the 84. 91. 93. 94. 103. and other Chapters of his Catalogue. Secondly, I know not what <hi>Trithemius</hi> was wont to do in his ſecond Book of Writers of the Order of S. <hi>Bennet,</hi> I never ſaw this work. Yet the little certainty which I found in the judgment of our Author, on the cuſtom of <hi>Sigebert,</hi> makes me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he has not judged better of that of <hi>Trithemius.</hi> In the main, I am not greatly ſolicitous whether <hi>Trithemius</hi> has ſeen, or not ſeen the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings which he attributes to <hi>Bertram.</hi> Yet I cannot but obſerve here the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Hieron. ab ang. Forti Epiſt.</hi> 3. p. 63.</note> of mens judgments. In 1652. the Elogies which <hi>Trithemius</hi> gives to <hi>Bertram,</hi> oblige Mr. <hi>Herman</hi> to believe, that the Book of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord,</hi> is the moſt Orthodox piece in the world. And in 1669. theſe ſame commendations which <hi>Trithemius</hi> gives to <hi>Bertram,</hi> oblige the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi> to affirm that <hi>Trithemius</hi> never read it, and ſo prais'd <hi>Bertram</hi> without any conſideration. Thirdly, It ſeems to me that the manner after which <hi>Cellot</hi>'s Anonymous has treated <hi>Ratram,</hi> not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, but by his Book, makes him not an Author unknown to others. For ſuppoſing <hi>Ratram</hi> were entirely unknown to this Anonymous, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the 12th. Century, we know that <hi>Florus</hi> the famous Deacon of the <note place="margin">

A. 1118. ſect.</hi> 29.</note> Church of <hi>Lyons</hi> was likewiſe treated no better than a <hi>quidam</hi> by the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians of the 12th. and 13th. Century, and <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> himſelf was ſo little known by <hi>Gaudefredus</hi> the Monk of <hi>Claravod,</hi> at the end of the 12th. Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, that <hi>Gaudefredus</hi> confounds him with <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> Deacon of the Roman Church, who lived about the year 500. <hi>Amalarius</hi> was very famous in the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:41961:348"/> 9th. Century, and well known by <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Debonnair,</hi> by whoſe order he <note place="margin">See <hi>Labb.</hi> of Writ <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> in <hi>Amalar.</hi>
                           </note> wrote. The Tranſcribers have corrupted his name in the Catalogue of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gebert,</hi> and turned it into <hi>Attularius; Trithemius</hi> ſpeaks of him in his Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue under the name of <hi>Hamularius,</hi> and after an hundred Diſputes he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſtill in a manner unknown. Fourthly, It is ſurprizing enough to ſee the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi> attributing to the Authors themſelves the faults of the Tranſcribers, who have written the name of <hi>Ratram.</hi> He tells us that <hi>Sigebert</hi> gives to <hi>Bertram</hi> the name of <hi>Ratram</hi> in ſome Manuſcript Copies, that <hi>Trithemius</hi> ſpeaks of him under three different names, of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram,</hi> of <hi>Bertramnus,</hi> and of <hi>Bertrannus,</hi> that the Anonymous Author calls him <hi>Ratramnus,</hi> or <hi>Intram:</hi> I know not whether he ſpeaks in good earneſt, or to deride us: But if he ſpeaks ſeriouſly that thoſe who according to his ſuppoſition changed the Title of the Book of <hi>John Scot,</hi> made it paſs on purpoſe under theſe different names in different Copies 'twould have been good before a conjecture of this kind was offered, to undertake the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming of this diſcovery by the Authority of ſome Manuſcripts of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord,</hi> wherein might be ſeen theſe different names.</p>
                        <p>THE laſt mark of the ſuppoſition which the Author of the <hi>Diſſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> offers is, that if we will not acknowledg <hi>Bertram</hi> for a feign'd Author, and the Book of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord</hi> for the work of <hi>John Scot,</hi> we ſhall find our ſelves forced to admit ſuch ſtrange conſequences, and which approach ſo near to impoſſibilities, that the like cannot be parallel'd by all Antiquity.</p>
                        <p>BUT we need only to run thro the principal difficulties which our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor propoſes to find that all this is nothing. Firſt, It is not an abſurdity to pretend that in the 9th. Century there were two Authors, one named <hi>John Scot,</hi> known of all the world for the Author of the firſt Tranſlation of the Hierarchy of the feign'd <hi>Denys</hi> into Latin: The other called <hi>Ratramnus,</hi> whoſe name thro the ignorance of Tranſcribers, was corrupted into that of <hi>Bertram,</hi> or <hi>Bertramnus,</hi> or <hi>Bertran,</hi> as that of <hi>Amalarius</hi> has been into <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tularius,</hi> that of <hi>Aimoinus</hi> into <hi>Aumoinus, Ammonius</hi> and <hi>Annonius,</hi> under which this Author was firſt publiſh'd at <hi>Paris</hi> in the year 1514. Secondly, Neither is it any more an abſurdity to ſay they were both of 'em adverſaries to <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> not ſercet, as our Author affirms, but open ones, in writing againſt his Doctrin. The Anonymous Author mentions ſeveral adverſaries of <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> as <hi>Raban</hi> and <hi>Ratramnus.</hi> Thirdly, It is not ſo monſtrous an impoſſibility to maintain that <hi>Ratramnus</hi> and <hi>John Scot</hi> wrote both of 'em on the ſubject of the Euchariſt, and on Predeſtination: There were in their times two Diſputes on theſe ſubjects, and in effect we have their two Treatiſes of Predeſtination, publiſh'd by Mr. <hi>Mauguin.</hi> We know that in the 11th. Century the Popes burnt <hi>John Scot</hi>'s on the Euchariſt, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt their partiſans who ſuppreſſed all <hi>Berenger</hi>'s Books, and thoſe of his Diſciples, have likewiſe exterminated with the greateſt care the Copies of that of <hi>John Scot.</hi> By good hap that of <hi>Ratramnus,</hi> who is mention'd in the 12th. Century, as an adverſary to <hi>Paſchaſus,</hi> is yet extant, under the corrupted name of <hi>Bertram.</hi> Fourthly, Neither is there any abſurdity to conceive that the Writings of theſe two Authors touching the Euchariſt have been, the one dedicated to King <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> and the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by his Order. <hi>Ratramnus</hi> and <hi>John Scot</hi> were both of 'em particularly known and eſteem'd by this Prince. <hi>Ratramnus</hi> has written by his Order the Book of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> and <hi>John Scot</hi> in obedience to his Commands has
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:41961:349"/> tranſlated the Hierarchy of the pretended <hi>Denys,</hi> and was always greatly eſteem'd by him. Fifthly, It is not abſurd to believe that <hi>John Scot</hi> was oblig'd to write on the ſame ſubject as <hi>Ratramnus;</hi> their judgment was ſo conſiderable in their time, that <hi>Hincmar</hi> and <hi>Pardulus,</hi> two famous Biſhops, oblig'd <hi>John Scot</hi> to write on Predeſtination, and an Aſſembly of Biſhops oblig'd <hi>Ratramnus</hi> to write againſt the objections of the Greeks, which Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> had ſent them. Sixthly, It is an imaginary difficulty to ſay they have both of 'em had the fancy to give to <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> the Title of <hi>Charlemain.</hi> I have ſhewed that they have not done it; but that <hi>Berenger</hi> has been miſtaken in explaining this Title <hi>Ad Carolum Regem:</hi> and that it is very poſſible thoſe who Printed the Book of <hi>Bertram</hi> have underſtood this Title as <hi>Berenger</hi> did in a like ſubject, and in the ſame diſpute. Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, It is not an impoſſibility for two Books of the Body and Blood to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain each of 'em but one Book of a very indifferent ſize. Eighthly, There is no more difficulty to believe that two Writers who treat on the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject have uſed the ſame Witneſſes, the ſame Oriſon which was ſaid every day in the Service, than that they have drawn the ſame concluſions, and in terms perhaps not abſolutely the ſame, but very near one another. <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in his Letter to <hi>Frudegard,</hi> that this Oriſon was made for him, which cauſed all his Adverſaries to examin it, and urge the proper terms of it againſt him, without changing any thing therein. Neither do I any more believe that after what I have repreſented of the genius of theſe Authors, any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy will imagin they were both of 'em equally addicted to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, and were both wont to illuſtrate the myſteries of Religion by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments put in form, by Enthymemes, by Maxims and Principles drawn from Philoſophy: I have ſhew'd the difference which there is between the genius of <hi>Bertram</hi> and that of <hi>John Scot.</hi> Tenthly, It is equally falſe that neither of 'em dared to diſcover their minds touching the Real Preſence. Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himſelf will have <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Book to be <hi>John Scot</hi>'s, and <hi>John Scot</hi>'s Book was burn'd in a full Council, becauſe it oppoſes it. Eleventhly, There is no great matter of wonder that after the queſtion was moved, and the Book of <hi>John Scot</hi> burn'd, there ſhould be more diligent ſearch made after the Books which reſpected a Diſpute touching which <hi>Berenger</hi> maintain'd that <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> gave the occaſion by his novelties, and thus the Book of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram</hi> has appear'd ſince that of <hi>John Scot</hi> has diſappear'd.</p>
                        <p>IN fine, twelfthly, There are no rational people that will be perplexed with this imaginary difficulty of the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation,</hi> to wit, that of one of theſe Authors, which is <hi>Bertram,</hi> there ſhould remain nothing that is certain to poſterity, neither in reſpect of his quality, nor his name, altho his Book has remain'd, and that the quality of the other, to wit, <hi>John Scot,</hi> ſhould be well known, altho his Book be loſt. It is apparent enough who <hi>Ratramnus</hi> was, and that <hi>Bertram</hi> is but a name corrupted thro the ignorance of the Tranſcribers. But what I now repreſented is ſufficient to diſſipate the illuſion, which the name of <hi>Bertram</hi> had produced, and all reaſonable people will be fully convinced that <hi>Ratram</hi> is the Author of the Book of <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord,</hi> and not <hi>John Scot.</hi> We have only then to ſhew that the authority of this Book will be of no leſs weight, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing <hi>John Scot</hi> were the Author of it. For which purpoſe I have deſign'd the ſecond part of this Anſwer.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>THE Authority of <hi>John Scot</hi> was ſo conſiderable in the 9th. Century, that <hi>Hincmar</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Reims,</hi> and <hi>Pardulus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Laon,</hi> who found themſelves engaged in ſharp Diſputes touching Predeſtination and Grace with <hi>Gottheſcalc,</hi> believ'd they could not do better for their party than to oblige <hi>John Scot</hi> to write on theſe two ſubjects.

                        </p>
                        <p>HIS Reputation maintain'd it ſelf not only in <hi>France,</hi> but paſſed over into <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf. <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> the Popes Library-keeper gives him particular Commendations in a Letter which he wrote to <hi>Charles the Bald.

                        <p>WE may likewiſe here add the kindneſs which <hi>Alfred</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> had for him, and the Employs which this Prince gave him; but of this I ſhall diſcourſe hereafter.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall only ſay that <hi>John Scot</hi> was in effect, worthy of the eſteem and affection which the world ſhewed him, his Wit was lively and piercing; he was not only a profound Philoſopher, but alſo very well read in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and eſpecially the Greek ones, which was very rare in the 9th. Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, wherein the learning of the greateſt men was bounded by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtin, Gregory the Great, Iſidor</hi> of <hi>Sevil:</hi> and their skill lay in copying out theſe Authors word for word.</p>
                        <p>IN fine, we may moreover obſerve in favour of <hi>John Scot,</hi> that altho his Book of the Euchariſt, was condemned in the Councils of the 11th. Century, yet the reputation of the Author was perpetuated in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages, as appears from the authentick Teſtimonies, which all Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans give him. I ſhall not relate here what <hi>Inguſphus, William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury, Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham, Roger de Hoveden, Matthew</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and <hi>Florent</hi> of <hi>Worceſter</hi> have ſaid of him: we may find this in the Anſwer to the firſt <note place="margin">Part 3, ch. 3.</note> Treatiſe of the <hi>Perpetuity.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>WE need only add to theſe teſtimonies, Firſt, that of the Manuſcript of the Library of S. <hi>Victor,</hi> which has for Title, <hi>Memoriale Hiſtoriarum: Tempore eodem fuit Joannes Scotus vir perſpicacis ingenii &amp; mellitoe facundioe qui rogatu Caroli Calvi jamdudum verbo ad verbum Hierarcham Dionyſii de Groeco in Latinum tranſtulerat, &amp; poſt ſuper eundem librum fecit commentum, fecitque librum de naturoe diviſione, &amp; librum de Euchariſtiâ, qui poſtea lectus eſt, &amp; condemnatus in Synodo Vercellenſi â Papa Leone celebrata, eodem anno quo Lanfrandus ab errore Berengarii ſe purgavit, unde, ſicut dicit Lanfrandus, ipſe in fide deſipuit.

Thirdly, That of <hi>Naucler,</hi> Alfred, ſays he, <hi>had enriched the College of</hi> Oxford, <hi>eſpecially with</hi> John Scot, <hi>as with a Divine Star, which he drew over into</hi> England <hi>from</hi> France, <hi>where he was in favour with</hi> Charles the Bald.</p>
                        <p>If there needs any thing more to confirm the reputation of our Author, we ſhall ſcarcely find any one to whom there can be given any authority.</p>
                        <p>IT is true that his Book of the Euchariſt was condemned by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church in the 11th. Century; but it is remarkable that neither this Book nor its Author were condemned in the 9th. Century, wherein he lived,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:41961:350"/> and that his adverſaries who were greatly enraged againſt him, as appears by the Letter of the Church of <hi>Lyons,</hi> and the terms of the Council of <hi>Valence,</hi> and which conſequently was not in a condition to pardon him a Hereſie on the ſubject of the holy Sacrament, yet did not accuſe him on this Article. <hi>Cellot</hi> the Jeſuit being not willing to agree concerning the true reaſon why in that time they did not reproach <hi>John Scot</hi> about the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the Euchariſt, turns the buſineſs into admiration, and offers a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful reaſon of this ſilence; <hi>I cannot ſufficiently wonder,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that leaving</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Append. ad Hiſt. Gotheſc.</hi> p. 583.</note> 
                           <hi>the error which</hi> John Scot <hi>was ſaid to hold touching the Euchariſt; theſe droans</hi> (for thus does he call thoſe of <hi>Lyons) ſhould only apply themſelves to the ſubject of Predeſtination. This ſhews,</hi> adds he, <hi>that they did not mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo much the defending of the Faith, as the ruining the Party of thoſe of</hi> Reims; which is to ſay of <hi>Hincmar</hi> and his friends, who had condemned <hi>Gottheſcalc.</hi> But both his aſtoniſhment and reaſon too would equally va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, if he would have taken notice of what every one ſees, that the true cauſe why <hi>John Scot</hi> was not condemned in the 9th. Century, but in the 11th. was, that his belief was conformable to that of the Church of the 9th. Age, and became not otherwiſe till afterwards when the followers of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> prevail'd.</p>
                        <p>THE Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi> has taken another courſe to fully the <note place="margin">Artic. 1. of his Diſſert. o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </note> ſame of <hi>John Scot</hi>'s name, and gives a reaſon why his Book touching the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt was not condemned in the 9th. Century. He ſays there is in the Library of S. <hi>Germains des prés</hi> two Manuſcripts of a Dialogue, entituled, <hi>Of Natures,</hi> the Author of which is this ſame <hi>John Scot,</hi> and that this Book is full of Errors. He diſcourſes on theſe Errors with the greateſt art and care, and draws from 'em theſe two conſequences. 1. <hi>That</hi> John Scot <hi>was a man very likely to invent Hereſies contrary to the Doctrin of the Church of his time. 2. We muſt not be aſtoniſh'd that Hereſies, having been only tanght by a particular perſon, who had no followers, that the Book wherein he taught them ſhould not be publickly condemned.</hi> And this is what he believes the Dialogue <hi>of Natures</hi> doth invincibly ſhew, becauſe that on one hand it is full of Errors, and on the other, we do not find it was condemned.</p>
                        <p>AS to the firſt, I freely acknowledg this Book is <hi>John Scot</hi>'s, and that there are Errors in it; but the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi> ought not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal that <hi>John Scot</hi> did not offer 'em of his own head, but herein only fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the opinions of ſeveral famous Fathers amongſt the Greeks and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins, as S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> S. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nyſſe,</hi> and S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> the pretended <hi>Denis</hi> the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> and S. <hi>Maximus;</hi> which does not hinder but theſe Fathers have been always in great veneration in the Church. <hi>John Scot</hi> cites them on each of theſe opinions, he ſets down their paſſages; which made <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> to ſay, <hi>That his Book may profitably ſerve to reſolve difficult que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, provided he be excuſed in ſome things, in which he has wandred from the way of the Latins, by reaſon of his following too much the Greeks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>AS to the ſecond conſequence there is a great deal of difference between the Book of <hi>John Scot of Natures,</hi> and that of the Euchariſt of the ſame Author. Firſt, The Book <hi>of Natures</hi> perhaps has not been known but to few perſons, becauſe 'twas wrote at the entreaty of a particular perſon, to wit of <hi>Wolfadus</hi> Canon of <hi>Rheims,</hi> whereas that which he wrote on the Euchariſt muſt needs have been publick, ſeeing he wrote by order of <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> and in a time wherein the novelties of <hi>Paſchaſus</hi> had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:41961:351"/> much clamour in the Church. Secondly, Altho the Book <hi>of Natures</hi> had been known, the errors which are therein contain'd being of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whoſe names are venerable in the Church, we muſt not think it ſtrange that they were ſpared out of reſpect to the Fathers, for whom the world has ever had ſo great a veneration and condeſcention, altho they have not approved all their ſentiments. But ſuppoſing the Church ever believed Tranſubſtantiation, and Real Preſence, the error broach'd and maintain'd by <hi>John Scot</hi> in the Book of the Euchariſt contrary to theſe two Articles, would have been his only, and not the Fathers, and conſequently nothing would have hindred the world from exerciſing the greateſt ſeverity againſt <hi>John Scot</hi>'s Book, and openly condemning it. Thirdly, The errors which are in the Book <hi>of Natures</hi> are ſpeculative errors in matters out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon road and reach of ſenſe; whereas that of the Book of the Euchariſt would have been a particular error on a Sacrament, which is continually before the eyes of Chriſtians; for ſuppoſing, as I ſaid, the Church of that time had believ'd Tranſubſtantiation and the Real Preſence, as the Roman Church believes them at this day, and adored the Sacrament as the proper Son of God Incarnate, the error of <hi>John Scot</hi> would have overthrown the Faith and Rites of all Chriſtians, and would have had as many adverſaries as there are perſons in the Church: The King himſelf, by whoſe order he wrote, would have been intereſs'd to have condemn'd ſo pernicious a Book, to avoid the being ſuſpected that he himſelf ſowed Hereſies by the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd hand of <hi>John Scot.</hi> It is then evident that the two conſequences of the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi> are inſufficient to diminiſh or eface the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and authority of <hi>John Scot</hi>'s name: and thus when the Book which bears the name of <hi>Bertram,</hi> ſhould be in effect of <hi>John Scot,</hi> this Book would not ceaſe to be of great weight and great authority.</p>

                        <p>FOR the firſt of theſe Articles, I know not why the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi> ſhould trouble himſelf about it; ſeeing Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> mention'd nothing like it in his diſcourſe of <hi>John Scot.</hi> We know that <hi>Bede</hi> died in <note place="margin">Artic. 4.</note> 735. that <hi>Alcuinus</hi> died in 804, and that <hi>John Scot</hi> was living in the year 870. We acknowledg alſo that <hi>John Scot</hi> could not be the Founder of the
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:41961:351"/> Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſeeing that this Univerſity did not begin till about the middle of the 12th. Century, as all learned men are agreed. Yet can it not be deny'd but that thoſe who fell into theſe miſtakes, (to wit, of making <hi>John Scot Bede</hi>'s Diſciple the Companion of <hi>Alcuinus,</hi> and the Founder of the Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> by ſeeing the name of <hi>John Scot</hi> ſo famous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned amongſt Authors) would advance by the ſame of his perſon the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of th' Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> which helps to eſtabliſh his Reputation and Authority, and to combat in general the pretenſions of the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>AS to the ſecond Article wherein our Author maintains that <hi>John Erige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> was not Abbot of <hi>Aetheling,</hi> Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> contented himſelf with ſaying in general, <hi>That he was made in</hi> England <hi>Abbot of a Monaſtery of the Royal Foundation. Ingulphus</hi> ſays the ſame, and remarks in particular that this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery was that of <hi>Aetheling.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>SO that here we have at leaſt Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>'s ſincerity ſecured. <hi>Harsfield</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Sect. 9. cap. 12.</note> and <hi>Cellot</hi> the Jeſuit have related as well as he, the teſtimony of <hi>Ingulphus;</hi> and I know not why he might not make uſe of it as well as theſe Authors <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Append. ad Hiſt. Goth.</hi> p. 885.</note> who are of the Roman Church.</p>
                        <p>I confeſs 'tis ſomewhat difficult to determin preciſely whether the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Ingulphus</hi> be abſolutely true, when he ſays <hi>Alfred</hi> gave the Abby of <hi>Aetheling</hi> to <hi>John Scot;</hi> for I know there are Authors who deny that <hi>John</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Aetheling</hi> was the ſame <hi>John Scot</hi> whom we mean. We will ſee preſently what are the reaſons which the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi> brings to prove that theſe are two different perſons; yet howſoever, 'tis true in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Authors agree that <hi>John Scot,</hi> the ſame we ſpeak of, was received very kindly by King <hi>Alfred,</hi> and had a very conſiderable employ in <hi>England,</hi> when he retired thither; which is ſufficient to keep up his Reputation, and ſhew he was in no ſort reſpected as an Heretick, who withſtood the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and univerſal Faith of the Church.</p>
                        <p>MOREOVER, the reaſons which the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to oppoſe the teſtimony of <hi>Ingulphus,</hi> who will have <hi>John Scot</hi> to be Abbot of <hi>Aetheling,</hi> are very ſlight ones, and fall ſhort of convincing or perſuading. He agrees there was one <hi>John</hi> who was made Abbot of <hi>Aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> but will have him to be another than our <hi>John Scot.</hi> His firſt proof is, that <hi>John</hi> Abbot of <hi>Aetheling</hi> was of the County of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> which is to ſay, of the County of the Weſtern Saxons, whereas the other was an Iriſh man.</p>
                        <p>BUT this proof is a very weak one; for theſe terms, <hi>Ex Saxonum genere,</hi> as ſpeak <hi>Aſſerus</hi> and <hi>Roger de Howden,</hi> or, <hi>Ex antiqua Sazonia ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undum,</hi> as ſpeaks <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> are not inconſiſtent with the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name of <hi>Scot,</hi> or <hi>Erigenus;</hi> that is to ſay, Iriſh man. Nothing can hinder but that he might have been originally from the County of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and an Iriſh man by the abode which he made in <hi>Ireland.</hi> It may happen that our French men have ſpoken leſs exact of the true Country of <hi>John Scot,</hi> than <hi>Aſſerus</hi> has done, who knew him more particularly. In effect <hi>Harsfield</hi> Will have <hi>John Scot</hi> to be ſurnamed Iriſh man, only on the account of the abode which he made in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he had been brought up, but was really an Engliſh man, and of the Country of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> We know that the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:41961:352"/> ſurnames of Countries have been ever given to divers perſons, by reaſon of the abode which they made therein. <hi>Cicero</hi> gives two Countries to every man, one the Country where he is born, and the other the Country which has favourably received him. When once this laſt kind of ſurnames is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as proper, one retains 'em till death, and after it; which is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with what may be ſaid moreover of the Country wherein a man is born. And therefore <hi>Ingulphus</hi> who firſt deried the Text of <hi>Aſſerus,</hi> did not believe that for this pretended difference of the name of Iriſh man, and of the Country of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> a man ought to make two <hi>John Scots,</hi> the one a Saxon, and the other an Iriſh man. <hi>Similiter,</hi> ſays he, <hi>de veteri Saxonia Joannem cognomento Scotum accerrimi ingenii Philoſophum ad ſe alliciens, Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingioe Monaſterii ſui conſtituit Praelatum.</hi> When he ſays, <hi>De veteri Saxonia Joannem cognomento Scotum;</hi> he ſhews ſufficiently that there is not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him any inconſiſtency in making him of the Country of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and yet giving him the ſurname of Iriſh; the one deſigning the Country of his Birth, and the other that of his Abode. The Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi> tells us that <hi>Ingulphus</hi> has ſuffered himſelf to be impoſed on by ſome Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, who was affection'd to <hi>John Scot.</hi> What is this but a mere conjecture in the Air, which has neither proof nor ground, nor any appearance of truth?</p>
                        <p>THE ſecond proof of our Author is taken from that he pretends <hi>John Scot</hi> withdrew into <hi>England</hi> t' avoid the ſhame which he endured of being reputed an Heretick in <hi>France,</hi> whereas <hi>John</hi> Abbot of <hi>Aetheling</hi> was ſent for over into <hi>England</hi> by a meſſenger from <hi>Alfred.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THIS proof is no more concluſive than the reſt: For firſt, <hi>Ingulphus</hi> overthrows this pretended occaſion of the retreat of <hi>John Scot</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> by ſaying that <hi>Alfred</hi> drew him over to him. The firſt who ſuppoſed this cauſe of his retreat was <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> or <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> of whom the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi> ſays <hi>Simeon</hi> has borrow'd it. Now <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> wrote a long time ſine <hi>Ingulphus;</hi> others have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> without examining whether what he ſaid was well grounded or not. So that all their teſtimonies do reduce themſelves to that of one man, poſterior to <hi>Ingulphus,</hi> and who conſequently by all the laws of Hiſtory cannot be preferred before him. Secondly, Theſe ſame Hiſtorians who will have the cauſe of <hi>John Scot</hi>'s retreat into <hi>England</hi> to be an effect of the diſpleaſure which he had to be accuſed of Hereſie by his adverſaries, yet do acknowledg that he was drawn over thither by <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred, Cujus munificentia illectus, &amp; magiſterio ejus, ut ex Scriptis Regis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellexi, Melduni reſedit,</hi> ſays <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> which is to ſay, that he was won by the Kings liberality, to be his Tutor. <hi>Roger de Howden</hi> and <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> ſay the ſame thing in the ſame terms: ſo that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them theſe two things do not contradict one another, that <hi>John Scot</hi> was call'd into <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Alfred,</hi> and yet came thither thro ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt which his enemies had given him in <hi>France.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THIRDLY, French Hiſtorians ſay alſo that <hi>John Scot</hi> was called over into <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Alfred.</hi> Obſerve here what an ancient Chronicle of <hi>France</hi> ſays which ends in 1137. At the entreaty of <hi>Alfred,</hi> John Scot <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi>'d <note place="margin">Hiſt. <hi>Fran.</hi> T. 3. p. 359.</note> 
                           <hi>from</hi> France, <hi>where he was with</hi> Charles <hi>the</hi> Bald. But fourthly, If we ſuppoſe that this <hi>John Scot,</hi> whom the Hiſtorians ſay was fetcht over from <hi>France</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> together with S. <hi>Grimbald,</hi> by an Ambaſſador,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:41961:352"/> ſent on purpoſe by <hi>Alfred</hi> for him, is different from our <hi>John Scot;</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid who he was, <hi>Aſſerus</hi> ſpeaks of him; not as of an obſcure perſon, but as a famous man. <hi>The King,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſent beyond Sea into</hi> France <hi>Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, to ſearch for Maſters, and drew over</hi> Grimbald <hi>a Prieſt and a Monk; he brought over likewiſe</hi> John, <hi>who was alſo a Prieſt and a Monk, a man of a great wit, and well vers'd in all Sciences.</hi> Let us be inform'd who this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous man was in <hi>France,</hi> this man that was ſo well known, and deſerved to be ſent for by an Embaſſage? For we do not any where find there was in <hi>France</hi> after the middle of the 9th. Century any other man of this Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, and name of <hi>John,</hi> but <hi>John Scot.</hi> We find indeed mention made of of <hi>Grimbald,</hi> that he was a Monk of S. <hi>Bertin,</hi> who underſtood Muſick, but was far from equalling in Wit and Learning this <hi>John Scot,</hi> of whom <hi>Aſſerus</hi> ſpeaks. How then came it to paſs that there remains no trace of this pretended <hi>John,</hi> ſuppoſing this was not he.</p>
                        <p>THE Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi>'s third foundation is, that <hi>John Scot</hi> withdrew from <hi>France</hi> into <hi>England</hi> about the year 864. whereas <hi>John Scot</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Aetheling,</hi> companion of S. <hi>Grimbald</hi> came over there but in 884. But why muſt <hi>John Scot</hi> have paſs'd over from <hi>France</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> about the year 864. <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſays our Author, Nicholas <hi>the Firſt, prayed</hi> Charles the Bald <hi>to ſend him ſpeedily</hi> John Scot, <hi>or at leaſt to ſuffer him no longer to remain in his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of</hi> Paris, <hi>leſt he ſhould corrupt it with his Errors.</hi> Hinc eſt quod dilectioni veſtrae vehementer rogantes mandamus, quatenus Apoſtolatui noſtro Joannem repraeſentari faciatis, aut certe Pariſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us in Studio, cujus jam olim Capital fuiſſe perhibetur, morari non ſinatis, ne cum tritico ſacri eloquii grana Lolii &amp; Zizaniae miſcere dignoſcatur; &amp; panem quaerentibus, venenum porrigat. <hi>'Twas without doubt,</hi> adds our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, <hi>after theſe Letters that</hi> John Scot <hi>withdrew into</hi> England. <hi>Seeing then Pope</hi> Nicolas <hi>has govern'd the Church ſince the year 858, till 868. We muſt place th' arrival of</hi> John Scot <hi>into</hi> England <hi>about the year 864. that is to ſay, twenty years before</hi> Alfred <hi>cauſed</hi> Grimbald <hi>and</hi> John <hi>to come to him. For</hi> Aſſer <hi>aſſures us this was in the year</hi> 884.</p>
                        <p>THIS reaſoning ſuppoſes facts which are not proved. Firſt, This fragment of the Letter of <hi>Nicolas</hi> I. to <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> wherein is mention of <hi>John Scot</hi> and the Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> is a piece ſuppoſed a great while after the 9th. Century; for the Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> as I have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, began not before the 12th. Century; and theſe terms of <hi>Studium</hi> and of <hi>Capital,</hi> to expreſs the Univerſity and Rector of it, were not in uſe in <hi>Nicolas</hi> I. his time. Secondly, The Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi> informs us that the Letter of <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> the Popes Library-keeper to <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> of which we have already ſpoken, was written in the year 875. and proves it by a Manuſcript of the Jeſuits of <hi>Bourges,</hi> which bears expreſly this date. Now in this Letter <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> gives ſingular commendations to <hi>John Scot,</hi> calling him <hi>virum per omnia ſanctum;</hi> what likelihood is there then, <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſius</hi> would give praiſes of this kind to a man who was eſteem'd at <hi>Rome</hi> an Heretick, and was oblig'd for this reaſon, and the Popes accuſation, to withdraw from the Court of <hi>Charles?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>OUR Author impertinently ſuppoſes from the teſtimony of <hi>Aſſerus,</hi> that <hi>John</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Aetheling</hi> paſs'd not over into <hi>England</hi> till 884. Had he read <hi>Aſſerus</hi> with a little more reflection, he would have found that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho <hi>Aſſerus</hi> refers the ſending for of <hi>Grimbald</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> to the year 884
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:41961:353"/> yet does he not thereby intend preciſely to fix it to the year 884. <hi>Aſſerus</hi> recapitulates on the year 884. the private life of <hi>Alfred,</hi> ſince the year 868. which was the year of his Marriage, omitting ſeveral important things that he might not interrupt the narration of the Wars of this Prince, even as in the year 868. he had recapitulated whatſoever <hi>Alfred</hi> had done during his youth. So <hi>Aſſerus</hi> does not ſay in <hi>that year,</hi> as he muſt have done if he would have preciſely deſign'd the year 884. but he ſays <hi>in theſe times, his temporibus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE fourth proof of the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi> is no better than the reſt. He ſays that Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> having written that <hi>John Scot</hi> died in the year 884. or in the preceding year, he could not be this <hi>John</hi> whom <hi>Alfred</hi> the King of <hi>England</hi> ſent for by reaſon of his Reputation and Learning, ſeeing that this <hi>John</hi> was not made Abbot till the year 888. or 887. as all Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans agree, and that he began not his regency at <hi>Oxford</hi> till the year 886. as we find in the Annals of the Monaſtery of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> of which <hi>Grimbald</hi> was made Abbot at the ſame time as <hi>John</hi> his companion, was of that of <hi>Aetheling.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT there's no ſolidity in this proof. Firſt, It is plain one cannot ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any thing certain from Hiſtorians, either touching the year of <hi>John Scot</hi>'s death, nor that wherein <hi>Alfred</hi> called <hi>Grimbald</hi> and <hi>John</hi> into <hi>England.</hi> Secondly, Neither is there any certainty in the Annals of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> which refer to the year 886. the foundation of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford</hi> by <hi>Grim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> his companion two years after their arrival in <hi>England;</hi> for this ſo great an antiquity of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford</hi> is a mere fable, as has been proved by Biſhop <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher:</hi> ſo that whatſoever can be reaſonably <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Antiq. Brit.</hi> p. 340, 341, 342.</note> concluded hence is, that there being nothing certain in all this Chronology, there can be nothing alledged hence to conclude that <hi>John Scot</hi> died in the year 883. or 884. And conſequently the conjecture of Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> (who has only in this reſpect follow'd <hi>Baronius</hi> may be reſpected as doubtful.) But to conclude hence that <hi>John Scot,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Aetheling</hi> were two different perſons, is very abſurd.</p>
                        <p>AFTER all, two things clearly enough ſhew that this whole criticiſm of the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation,</hi> who puts a difference between <hi>John Scot</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Aetheling,</hi> is merely imaginary, and that in effect they are but one and the ſame perſon. The firſt is, That amongſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the 9th. Century who were in any wiſe famous in <hi>France,</hi> we find no mention of this pretended <hi>John,</hi> whom <hi>Alfred</hi> ſent for. The other, that 'tis evident <hi>Aſſerus</hi> (who was Contemporary of <hi>John Scot)</hi> has made no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, if <hi>John Scot</hi> were not the Abbot of <hi>Aetheling,</hi> which is very ſtrange, ſeeing it cannot be denied but <hi>John Scot</hi> was a moſt famous man, much reſpected by <hi>Alfred,</hi> and conſequently well known to <hi>Aſſerus,</hi> who lived in the ſame Court.</p>
                        <p>IF we conſider theſe two reaſons with an unbiaſſed mind, I am perſuaded they will be found ſtronger than all the conjectures of our Author. It is true one may yet form a difficulty which our Author has not taken notice of, which is, that <hi>Aſſerus</hi> ſeems to ſay this <hi>John</hi> of whom he ſpeaks was Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinated by his Monks at <hi>Aetheling,</hi> whereas <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> and the Hiſtorians who follow'd him, aſſure us, that <hi>John Scot</hi> was kill'd by his Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars at <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> and there interred. But it is certain there could be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:41961:353"/> more eaſie than to confound the circumſtance of the place wherein <hi>John Scot</hi> was aſſaſſinated, and take it for another, <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> who is the firſt of thoſe who laid the Scene of this Tragedy at <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> recorded it near 250. years after it hapned. <hi>Aſſerus</hi> does not ſay <hi>John Scot</hi> died on the ſpot, and it will not ſeem impoſſible, that having been woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at <hi>Aetheling,</hi> he was carried to <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> or dying at <hi>Aetheling,</hi> his body was carried thither, or having been Abbot of <hi>Aetheling</hi> and <hi>Malmſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> both together, as it was commonly the cuſtom of that time, for one man to have ſeveral Abbies, this might give occaſion to this difference. Howſoever it be, it is far more reaſonable to conclude from the conformity of the relation of <hi>Aſſerus</hi> and <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> touching the main of th'event, than from one only Hiſtory, to make two by reaſon of ſome ſlight diverſity which is between 'em on the circumſtance of the place. And this ſeems the more likely, becauſe, as I have already ſaid, we have the formal teſtimony of <hi>Ingulphus</hi> an Hiſtorian of the 11th. Century, who aſſures us that this <hi>John</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Aetheling</hi> was no other but <hi>John Scot.</hi>

                           <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> has well conjectured that theſe Verſes were ancienter than his time, <hi>Scabri quidem,</hi> ſays he, <hi>&amp; moderni temporis lima carentes, ſed ab antiquo non ita deformes.</hi>

                        <p>TO this proof we muſt add the teſtimony of <hi>Gotzelin</hi> who has inſerted <hi>John</hi> in his Catalogue of Engliſh Saints, which he made in the beginning of the 12th.

                        <p>WHEREUNTO we may add the teſtimony of almoſt all Hiſtorians. 'Tis thus the continuer of <hi>Bede</hi> ſpeaks, as alſo <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury, Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham, Roger de Howden, Matthew</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter, Helinaud</hi> the Monk
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:41961:354"/> of <hi>Froidmond,</hi> the Author of <hi>Memoriale Hiſtoriarum</hi> (whoſe paſſage I have related) <hi>Vincent de Beavais, Antonin</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Florence, Baronius</hi> and ſeveral other modern Authors that have follow'd them.</p>
                        <p>TO all which the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi> anſwers, that he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges the holineſs of this famous <hi>John,</hi> as well by the Epitaph ſpoken of by <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury;</hi> and the Hiſtorians who have written after him, as by the Catalogue of <hi>Gotzlin;</hi> but denies this <hi>John</hi> to be the ſame <hi>John Scot.</hi> He pretends then that <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> who firſt attributed to <hi>John Scot,</hi> what agreed only to another <hi>John</hi> a Martyr, was to blame in doing it, that the Hiſtorians who followed <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> ought not to have followed him, and that in effect <hi>William</hi> himſelf offers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to refute what he himſelf ſays. To fortifie this conjecture he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves that the Martyrdom of <hi>John Scot</hi> was unknown to <hi>Berenger,</hi> and thoſe of his Party, who could not have been ignorant of it, neither would have failed to take notice of it, eſpecially ſince the condemnation of <hi>John Scot</hi> under <hi>Nicolas</hi> II. Whence he concludes that the ſame of the Martyrdom of <hi>John Scot</hi> was diſperſed up and down by his Diſciples, and that this was not the ſentiment of the Church in which <hi>John Scot</hi> died.</p>
                        <p>BUT there are few people who will remain ſatisfi'd with theſe conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of our Author. For firſt, If this <hi>John</hi> the Martyr of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> be not <hi>John Scot,</hi> who was he then? How comes it people have ſo univerſally loſt the knowledg of him, ſince <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> has confounded him with <hi>John Scot?</hi> Did he live before <hi>John Scot,</hi> or ſince? How could <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>'s miſtake cauſe all <hi>England</hi> to loſe the knowledg of him? How comes it no body ever diſcovered the error of <hi>William?</hi> Whence is it that <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> himſelf could not meet with any thing to undeceive him, when he ſought into the Antiquities of his Convent for the making his Hiſtory? 'Tis very ſtrange that in a matter of fact, a perſon who has written at <hi>Paris</hi> in 1669. ſhould pretend to know better whoſe the Tomb was that was ſeen in the 12th. Century at <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> than <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> who lived in this ſame Convent, and who apparently omitted no enquiries for his ſatisfaction.</p>
                        <p>IT is probable that <hi>William</hi> was not the firſt Author who mention'd the Martyrdom of <hi>John Scot.</hi> For the continuer of <hi>Bede,</hi> whoſe Book was Printed at <hi>Heidelberg</hi> in 1587. formally mentions it, and the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi> believes that he who continued this work of <hi>Bede</hi> is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from <hi>William.</hi> I confeſs that <hi>Voſſius</hi> has been miſtaken in fixing this Author to the year 1080. ſeeing it is certain he lived till the beginning of the 12th. Century. But it does not follow from the error of <hi>Voſſius</hi> that he was poſterior to <hi>William.</hi> This Continuer clearly denotes that he was Contemporary to <hi>Guitmond,</hi> now <hi>Guitmond</hi> preceded <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury;</hi> for this latter wrote in 1142. whereas the other died about the end of the 11th. Century, or at the beginning of the 12th. That if there be found ſeveral things alike in this Continuer, and in <hi>William,</hi> it is more reaſonable to ſay that <hi>William</hi> has taken from the Continuer, than to ſay the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuer has taken from <hi>William,</hi> and that the rather, becauſe <hi>William</hi> has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged his Hiſtory farther than the other by thirty years, which is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Character of a later Hiſtorian.</p>
                        <pb n="313" facs="tcp:41961:354"/>
                        <p>BUT ſuppoſing <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> be the firſt who has ſpoken of the Martyrdom of <hi>John Scot,</hi> this does but the more confirm the truth of this Hiſtory: for writing as he did in the very place, and in the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent wherein what he relates hapned, 'tis juſt to believe, that in this Narration he has offered nothing, but what was grounded on authentick Acts, or on a Tradition which in his time paſs'd for an undeniable truth in this Convent.</p>
                        <p>IT is to no purpoſe for the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi> to diſtinguiſh what this <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> has taken from the ancient Monuments of his Church, and what he has added thereunto of his own. He ought not thus to make of his own head this diſtinction on an Hiſtorian of the 12th. Century, and to tell us preciſely, here's what he has taken from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of his Church; here's what he has added thereunto of his own: There was one <hi>John</hi> that ſuffered Martyrdom and was reputed a Saint; this is of the ancient Monuments of the Church of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> but that this <hi>John</hi> was <hi>John Scot,</hi> is an addition of <hi>William.</hi> This diſtinction of our Author is bold enough, and was in effect unknown to <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> to <hi>Roger de Howden,</hi> to <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and to all thoſe other Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians which I have already denoted, who all certainly believ'd, that the Martyrdom of <hi>John Scot,</hi> related by <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> was a truth of Hiſtory which is beyond queſtion.</p>
                        <p>HIS telling us that <hi>William</hi> was the firſt Hiſtorian who gave to King <hi>Alfred</hi> two Maſters of the name of <hi>John,</hi> the one ſurnam'd the Saxon Abbot of <hi>Aetheling,</hi> the other ſurnam'd <hi>Scot,</hi> and ſince a Martyr. Firſt, <hi>William</hi> does not ſay formally that this was two different men, <hi>John</hi> the Saxon, and <hi>John Scot,</hi> nor that one was ſurnam'd the Saxon, and the other <hi>Scot;</hi> he ſays only in one place, <hi>Joannem ex antiqua Saxonia oriundum:</hi> and in another, <hi>Joannes Scotus.</hi> Neither muſt one neceſſarily conclude from his diſcourſe that he regarded them as two different men, as will appear if we take notice of what he wrote, and of the occaſion which has oblig'd him the firſt time to make mention of this <hi>John,</hi> as it were tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiently, reſerving himſelf to ſpeak of him more amply afterwards, as he has done. But when we ſhould ſuppoſe, that <hi>William</hi> would diſtinguiſh theſe two <hi>Johns,</hi> this makes nothing to th' eſtabliſhing what he relates of the Martyrdom of <hi>John Scot</hi>'s being a fable of his own invention: on the contrary, this very thing would help to eſtabliſh, that knowing two <hi>Johns,</hi> and diſtinguiſhing them, he muſt have better known what ought to be ſaid of both one and the other. Neither can it be ſaid that he made two <hi>Johns</hi> Tutors of <hi>Alfred;</hi> for when he ſpeaks of <hi>John</hi> who was Abbot of <hi>Aethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> he does not ſay that he was the Tutor of <hi>Alfred,</hi> he ſays this only under the name of <hi>John Scot.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>AS to what the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi> has remark'd, that <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> in his Letter written to <hi>Charles the Bald</hi> in 875. ſeems to ſpeak of <hi>John Scot</hi> as of a man already dead; which ſhews that he was not the Tutor of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred,</hi> ſeeing that this Prince gave not himſelf to learning till in the year 884. Neither is it moreover likely that ſo Religious a Prince would make uſe of ſuch a man as <hi>John Scot,</hi> who was decried as an Heretick driven out of th' Univerſity of <hi>Paris</hi> at the earneſt purſuit of <hi>Nicolas</hi> I. as holding Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins contrary to the principal Fundamentals of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                        <pb n="314" facs="tcp:41961:355"/>
                        <p>I anſwer firſt, That our Author returns continually to his fabulous Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as if <hi>John Scot</hi> could have been driven out in the 9th. Century from the Univerſity of <hi>Paris</hi> which began only in the 12th. Secondly, It is certain that <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Erigenus</hi> as of an holy and famous man, <hi>Virum,</hi> ſays he, <hi>per omnia ſanctum;</hi> which does not ſhew that he was thought then unworthy of being the Kings Tutor, nor that he was decried at <hi>Rome</hi> for an Heretick. Thirdly, Seeing that <hi>John Scot</hi> was very much eſteem'd by <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> he might be ſo too by <hi>Alfred</hi> Son of <hi>Aetelwolph,</hi> Son in law to <hi>Charles the Bald.</hi> And in effect, <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> teſtifies that he had ſeen the Letters of <hi>Alfred,</hi> wherein this Prince treated <hi>John Scot</hi> with great eſteem and affection, <hi>Alfredi munificentia &amp; miniſterio uſus, ut ex ſcriptis Regis intellexi, ſublimis Melduni reſedit,</hi> and this is a mere mockery to make theſe Letters paſs for fictious ones fram'd by the friends of <hi>John Scot</hi> and <hi>Berenger.</hi> Fourthly, It is not true that <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> ſpeaks poſitively of <hi>John Scot,</hi> as of a man already deceaſed, and ſuppoſing it were, he might think ſo by reaſon of his great age, or ſome falſe report of his death. In fine, our Author abſurdly ſuppoſes that <hi>Alfred</hi> did not betake himſelf to learning till the year 884. he has faln into this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake for want of conſidering that altho <hi>Aſſerus</hi> and ſome of thoſe that have follow'd him have attributed to this year what they have ſaid of the Piety of <hi>Alfred,</hi> and his applying himſelf to learning, yet this happens merely from their recapitulating what hapned ſince the year 868, till 884, as I have already obſerv'd.</p>
                        <p>NEITHER is there more ſtrength in the Argument which our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor draws from ſome terms which <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> makes uſe of in relating the Hiſtory of the Martyrdom of <hi>John Scot. Hoc tempore creditur fuiſſe Joannes Scotus (propter hanc infamiam</hi> (credo) <hi>taeduit eum Franciae) à pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eris quos docebat ut fertur perforatus, martyr aeſtimatus eſt.</hi> He pretends that theſe terms are doubtful, fears and ſuſpicions, and that theſe ways of ſpeaking are likely to make one doubt of the truth of this relation.</p>
                        <p>BUT all this deſerves no anſwer. Firſt, The Author of the <hi>Diſſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> has mixt <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi>'s Text which bears <hi>Propter hanc infamiam, &amp;c.</hi> with that of <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> who relates this fact as a thing evidently certain. And in effect the firſt term <hi>creditur</hi> refers to the time wherein <hi>John Scot</hi> lived in <hi>England.</hi> The ſecond <hi>credo</hi> is added by the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation,</hi> being not the Text of <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> who ſays only, <hi>Propter hanc infamiam taeduit eum Franciae,</hi> and ſuppoſing it were in the Text of <hi>Simeon,</hi> 'twould only denote that it was his conjecture that <hi>John Scot</hi> left <hi>France</hi> for the diſpleaſure he had to find himſelf accuſed of Hereſie; neither do I know whether <hi>taeduit</hi> thus uttered, be not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion too weak for a man whom the trouble of ſeeing himſelf accuſed of a crime ſo capital as is that of Hereſie muſt make to have paſſed from one Realm to another. The third term <hi>ut fertur</hi> denotes only 'twas ſaid that <hi>John Scot</hi> was ſtabb'd to death with Pen-knifes. But the fourth, <hi>Martyr aeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matus eſt,</hi> does not denote any thing doubtful, and plainly ſignifies that he was held for a Martyr, which appears from what <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> adds, <hi>Quod ſub ambiguo ad injuriam ſanctae animae non dixerim cum celebrem ejus memoriam ſepulchrum in ſiniſtro latere altaris &amp; Epitaphii prodant ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus:</hi> To build hereon conjectures of the falſity of this Hiſtory, is very idle.</p>
                        <pb n="315" facs="tcp:41961:355"/>
                        <p>IN fine, the Argument which the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation</hi> draws from the ſilence of <hi>Berenger</hi> and his Diſciples who never mention'd the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Martyrdom of <hi>John Scot,</hi> is of no weight. Firſt, We do not know what <hi>Berenger</hi> and his Diſciples have ſaid, the greateſt part of their Writings never coming to our notice. Secondly, There's no inconveniency to ſuppoſe that the memory of the Martyrdom of <hi>John Scot</hi> (hapning in a little place, as is <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> more than 150 years before the Diſputes of <hi>Berenger)</hi> became not ſo publick in <hi>France</hi> that <hi>Berenger</hi> and his Diſciples muſt needs know it. We know there are ſcarcely any remains of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Monaſtery of S. <hi>Angilbert,</hi> nor is he in the Catalogue of the Saints, <hi>Fruſtra tamen Angilbertum quaeras, ut &amp; innumeros tutelares noſtros ſanctos</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Syntagm. de Nith.</note> 
                           <hi>inter moderna ſanctorum ſyntagmata,</hi> ſaid the deceaſed M. <hi>Peteau,</hi> Counſellor in the Parliament of <hi>Paris.</hi> A man may ſay the ſame thing of <hi>Ingelram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> or <hi>Angilramnus,</hi> who wrote the Book of Images under the name of <hi>Charlemain,</hi> and who paſs'd for a Saint. For his name was in fine forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. But thirdly, Suppoſing <hi>Berenger</hi> and his Diſciples had a particular notice of the Martyrdom and Holineſs of <hi>John Scot,</hi> all that can be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from their ſilence is, that oftentimes every thing is not ſaid on a ſubject which may be ſaid. How many times have our Authors alledged the Books of Images under the name of <hi>Charlemain,</hi> without publiſhing the quality of Saint which has been given to this Prince? Has <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> the adverſary of <hi>John Scot</hi> been mention'd as a Saint by <hi>Lanfranc,</hi> and his other partners in their Diſputes againſt <hi>Berenger?</hi> Yet is it certain he was made to paſs for one at <hi>Corbie,</hi> and this circumſtance has been obſerved by <hi>Alanus</hi> and <hi>Sirmond.</hi> But, ſays the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation,</hi> Aſcelin <hi>would not</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">De Euch. p. 1. c. 21. In vita Paſch.</note> 
                           <hi>have treated</hi> John Scot <hi>as an Heretick, he would have put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Book and his Perſon, had he believ'd he paſs'd for a Martyr and Saint in the Church.</hi> I anſwer, that this remark concludes nothing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that <hi>Aſcelin</hi> ſuffered himſelf to be tranſported by his paſſion and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice; but <hi>Aſcelin</hi>'s tranſports do not at all invalidate the credibility of the Martyrdom and Holineſs of <hi>John Scot.</hi> And as to our Author's remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that neither does <hi>Ingulphus</hi> ſpeak of this Martyrdom; we need only tell him that all Hiſtorians do not ſay every thing. <hi>Ingulphus</hi> ſays but one word of <hi>John Scot</hi> in treating of another ſubject. He denotes none of the circumſtances of his life, he relates only that he was called into <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Alfred,</hi> and ſettled at <hi>Aetheling.</hi> Yet is it true that he gives him the Title of a <hi>moſt holy Monk.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IT is then certain that the ſilence of theſe Writers can neither diminiſh the <note place="margin">Artic. 7.</note> truth of the relation which <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> makes touching the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom of <hi>John Scot,</hi> nor the eſteem of his Holineſs in that Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he lived.</p>
                        <p>IT is certainly no leſs vain and irrational for the Author of the <hi>Diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> to ſet himſelf as he has done on criticiſing on a paſſage of <hi>Thomas Fuller,</hi> and a teſtimony of <hi>Hector Boetius Deidonan.</hi> For ſuppoſing that <hi>Thomas Fuller</hi> and ſeveral with him, were miſtaken in ſaying that the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrology which makes mention of <hi>John Scot</hi> in the 4th. of the Ides of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> was Printed at <hi>Anvers</hi> in the year 1586. whereas it was Printed in 1583. by the command of <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. ſuppoſing 'twere true that this Martyrology was not the Roman, which neither <hi>Fuller,</hi> nor Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> have affirm'd, ſuppoſing it were moreover true that <hi>Baronius</hi> has not taken
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:41961:356"/> away the name of <hi>John Scot</hi> from the Roman Martyrology: and tho the words of <hi>Henry Firtſimon</hi> cited by <hi>Fuller</hi> and <hi>Varoeus</hi> were not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood yet is it certain, Firſt, That <hi>Molanus</hi> Profeſſor in Divinity at <hi>Louvain,</hi> has put <hi>John Scot</hi> in his Appendix to the Martyrology of <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſuard</hi> publiſh'd at <hi>Anvers</hi> in 1583. Secondly, That Mr. <hi>De Sauſſay</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Toul</hi> has like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſet him down in the Martyrology of the Gallican Church, and that both of 'em thought themſelves oblig'd to follow <hi>Deidonan,</hi> who ſays that <hi>John Scot</hi> was ſet down in the Catalogue of Saints by the ſacred Authority of the Popes. Thirdly, It may be that <hi>Arnaud Wion</hi> ſaying that the name of <hi>John Scot</hi> is to be ſeen in the Roman Martyrology, has taken that of <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> for the Roman one. And in effect the learned are agreed, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrology <note place="margin">Vide Valeſ. append ad Euſeb. Hiſt.</note> 
                           <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſuard</hi> was adopted by the Roman Church, and that there has not been any ſuch Martyrology as we have ſince <hi>Galeſinus</hi> and <hi>Baronius.</hi> Fourthly, Suppoſing <hi>Arnaud Wion</hi> was miſtaken in his conjecture, yet is it ſtill certain that he has placed <hi>John Scot</hi> in the rank of the Saints of the Order of S. <hi>Benet,</hi> wherein he has been followed by the learned <hi>Hugo Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> in the Text of the Martyrology of the Order of S. <hi>Benet,</hi> given the publick; which he confirms in the firſt Book of his Obſervations on this <note place="margin">Ad 4. id.

Fifthly, <hi>Alford</hi> the Jeſuit has follow'd <hi>Hugh Menard,</hi> and has not ſought all theſe ſubterfuges of the Author of the <hi>Diſſertation;</hi> for he has rank'd <hi>John Scot</hi> in the Catalogue of Saints, in his Annals of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Printed at <hi>Liege</hi> in 1663. wherein having mention'd him as a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, <note place="margin">A. 884 n. 4. &amp; indic.
